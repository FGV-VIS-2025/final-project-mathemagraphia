  "biografia": "Aleksei Krylov\n's father was Nikolai Alexandrovich Krylov who was a retired artillery officer. Around the time that Aleksei was born, his father was Deputy Marshal of the Nobility and became the first president of the Alatyr District Council. The family were certainly not wealthy, but as the son of an army veteran, Aleksei was entitled to a free education. He entered the Maritime High School in St Petersburg in\n1878\n. He graduated in\n1884\n, awarded a distinction, and was appointed to the compass unit of the Main Hydrographic Administration. There he began work on compass deviation, a topic he would return to many times. Krylov's work in the unit was supervised by Ivan Petrovich de Collong who was an outstanding scientist and the founder of the theory of magnetic deviation of the compass. De Collong had invented a new type of compass in\n1875\nand was Head of the Main Hydrographic Administration.\nIn\n1888\nKrylov joined the department of ship construction of St Petersburg Maritime Academy. There he was taught advanced mathematics by\nAleksandr Nikolaevich Korkin\n, a student of Chebyshev, who was an expert in partial\ndifferential equations\n.\nKorkin\nalways put in extra effort for the students whom he recognised as having exceptional abilities, giving them personal tuition and posing them very difficult and challenging problems. Krylov benefited greatly from\nKorkin\n's tuition and he graduated First Class in\n1890\nafter only two years of study.\nKorkin\nthen persuaded Krylov to stay at the Maritime Academy and take over teaching his courses. This Krylov did, remaining there to teach for almost\n50\nyears\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nHe taught various theoretical and engineering sciences for about fifty years at this military-maritime institute, creating from among his students a large school of shipbuilders who were both engineers and scientists.\nIn\n1898\nKrylov received a Gold Medal from the Royal Institution of Naval Architects for his outstanding contributions to the theory of oscillating motion of a ship.\nThe Naval Administration Towing Tank was set up in\n1894\nto perform ship model tests to find engine power requirements for specified speeds and hull lines which required the least power. It was the first experimental basin to test ship design in Russia and the sixth the world. The Superintendent of the Tank was A A Grekhnev but after he left, Captain of the Admiralty A N Krylov was appointed\n'the Acting Superintendent of the Tank\n' on\n3\nJanuary\n1900\n. Krylov proposed establishing a scientific institution that would include the Towing Tank, testing and physical-chemical laboratories for research on ship construction materials, a mechanical laboratory and an electrical engineering laboratory. On\n3\nApril\n1902\nEmperor Nicolas II visited the Towing Tank and:-\n... deigned to be entirely pleased with both the performed experiments and the observed order of things ...\nexpressing his Imperial gratitude to Krylov as the Superintendent of the Tank. Krylov's work at the Towing Tank covered\n[\n1\n]\n:-\n... theories of buoyancy, stability, rolling and pitching, vibration, and performance, and compass theories.\nThese were precisely the topics that\nEuler\ncalled 'naval science'. But Krylov went even further, joining a voyage on board the\n1\n-rank cruiser\nAskold\nin\n1902\n.\nIn January\n1908\n, Krylov, by this time a General, was appointed Chief Naval Ship Construction Inspector and President of the Maritime Engineering Committee\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nHis courage and integrity led to conflicts with officials of the Maritime Ministry and his refusal to do further work for them.\nin\n[\n6\n]\nBotchev gives examples which illustrate Krylov's struggle against officials:-\nTo promote his innovations, he often had to fight against stagnation and rigid views of the top officials. Once, giving a speech at an important meeting before a large audience, Krylov addressed naval officers asking them for their support in his \"fight against the rut in shipbuilding\". Being a naval officer at that time, he received an official reprimand for this speech. Another incident also quite remarkably illustrates Krylov's personality: on a sitting of a high-rank technical committee Krylov once took with him several technicians directly from the ships so that they could support his opinion in the debates.\nKrylov gave up his posts at the Maritime Ministry in\n1910\n. In\n1914\nhe was awarded an honorary doctorate in applied mathematics from Moscow University. In the same year he was elected a member of the\nRussian Academy of Sciences\n, becoming a full member in\n1916\n. After the October Revolution of\n1917\nKrylov sided with the Soviet Government but tried to influence their attitude towards science. In\n1919\n, along with others, he organised the Russian Association of Physicists. In February\n1919\nthey set up a committee of four, Ioffe, Krylov, Anri and Lazarev, to coordinate the receipt of foreign literature, instruments and equipment, and to restart foreign research travel. They called for government support for new institutes, the reestablishment of ties between physicists in Russia and abroad, and the resumption of publication of scientific journals. Indeed Krylov was one of the first scientists allowed to travel to the West after the Revolution, travelling to London in\n1921\nto re-establish contacts between Russia and the West.\nFrom\n1927\nuntil\n1932\nhe was director of the Physics-Mathematics Institute of the\nUSSR Academy of Sciences\n. He became an honoured scientist and engineer of the Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic in\n1939\nand, in\n1943\n, was awarded the State Prize for his work compass theory and made a \"hero of socialist labour\".\nKrylov made many mathematical advances in his applications of mathematics to shipbuilding. In hydrodynamics, among many advances, he made significant contributions to the theory of ships moving in shallow water. In\n1904\nhe constructed a mechanical integrator to solve ordinary differential equations, being the first in Russia to make such an instrument. He improved\nFourier\n's method for solving\nboundary value problems\nin a\n1905\npaper and gave many applications\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nWhile using mathematics and mechanics to work out his theory of ships, Krylov simultaneously improved the methods of both disciplines. In a paper on forced vibrations of fixed-section pivots\n(1905)\n, he presented an original development of\nFourier\n's method for solving boundary value problems, pointing out its applicability to a series of important questions: for example, the theory of steam-driven machine indicators, the measurement of gas pressure in the conduit of an instrument, and the twisting vibrations of a roller with a flywheel on its end.\nHe studied the acceleration of convergence of\nFourier series\nin a paper in\n1912\n, and studied the approximate solutions to differential equations in a paper published in\n1917\n.\nIn\n1931\nhe found a new method of solving the secular equation determining the frequency of vibrations in mechanical systems which is better than methods due to\nLagrange\n,\nLaplace\n,\nJacobi\nand\nLe Verrier\n. This paper\nOn the numerical solution of the equation by which, in technical matters, frequencies of small oscillations of material systems are determined\ndeals with eigenvalue problems. Krylov writes in the paper\n(\nsee for example\n[\n6\n]\n)\n:-\nIt is clear that, if for k =\n2\nand k =\n3\nit is easy to compose this\n[\nsecular\n]\nequation, then for k =\n4\nthe laying-out becomes cumbersome, and for values k more than\n5\nthis is completely unrealisable in a direct way. Therefore one should use methods where the full development of the determinant is avoided. The aim of the paper ...  is to present simple methods of composition of the secular equation in the developed form, after which, its solution, i.e. numerical computation of its roots, does not present any difficulty. Before we describe these methods, it is good to return a bit back and consider how the first creators of these methods,\nLagrange\nand\nLaplace\n, and then such a great astronomer as\nLe Verrier\nand such a great mathematician as\nJacobi\nproceeded ...\nThis obvious interest in the history of mathematics and mechanics come over in Krylov's work in a number of ways\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nKrylov's practical interests were combined with a deep understanding of the ideas and methods of classical mathematics and mechanics of the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries; and in the world of\nNewton\n,\nEuler\n, and\nGauss\n, he found forgotten methods that were applicable to the solution of contemporary problems.\nIn fact Krylov published the first Russian translation from Latin of\nNewton\n's\nPhilosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica\nin\n1915\n. Three editions were published during Krylov's lifetime, then in\n1989\na facsimile reproduction of the third edition was published. On\n5\nOctober\n1933\nKrylov gave a speech in Moscow during the celebration at the\nUSSR Academy of Sciences\nof the\n150\nth\nanniversary of the death of\nEuler\n. This speech was published in\n1935\n, and a Bulgarian translation of the speech was published in\n1983\non the occasion of the\n200\nth\nanniversary of\nEuler\n's death.\nFinally let us mention some of the classic texts which Krylov published. The first edition of\nLectures on Approximate Calculations\nappeared in\n1911\n, the second edition in\n1932\n, the third in\n1935\n, and the fourth in Krylov's collected works. The first edition of\nOn Some Differential Equations of Mathematical Physics Having Application to Technical Problems\nappeared in\n1913\n, the second edition in\n1932\n, and the fourth appeared in\n1948\nas part of Krylov's collected works.\nVibration of ships\nwas first published in\n1936\nas a textbook in shipbuilding for Technical Schools. In\n1943\nhe published\nThoughts and materials on teaching mechanics.\nThe ideas on teaching he presented in this text are considered in detail in\n[\n18\n]\n.\nKrylov married Elisaveta Dmitrievna Dranitsyna; their daughter Anna, later became Anna Kapitsa after marrying the famous physicist Pyotr Leonidovich Kapitsa who won the Nobel Prize for Physics in\n1978\nfor his research in magnetism and low-temperature physics. Krylov died in Leningrad\n(\nnow St Petersburg\n)\nand is buried in the Volkovo cemetery.",
