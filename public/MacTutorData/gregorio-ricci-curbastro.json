  "biografia": "Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro\n's father was Antonio Ricci-Curbastro and his mother was Livia Vecchi. It was a family of high status known throughout the province of Ravenna. Antonio Ricci-Curbastro, although certainly never achieving anything close to the fame achieved by his son Gregorio, nevertheless was himself well known as an engineer. Neither Gregorio nor his brother Domenico attended school. All their education prior to entering university was carried out at home where their parents employed private tutors.\nIn\n1869\nRicci-Curbastro entered the University of Rome with the intention of studying mathematics and philosophy. He was only sixteen years old at the time and, although he had not attended school, he was well prepared academically. Political events, however, conspired to make Rome a somewhat unfortunate choice, although a very natural one given his place of birth. When Ricci-Curbastro began his studies in Rome, although the Kingdom of Italy had been created a few years earlier, Rome was not part of that Kingdom being part of the Papal States in which Ricci was born and brought up. Rome had been attacked by Italian troops in\n1867\nbut France had defended the city and employed its troops against the attack. In\n1870\n, however, Italian troops captured Rome and it became the capital of the Kingdom of Italy. Ricci-Curbastro studied at Rome for one year from\n1869\nto\n1870\nand then returned to his parents home where he remained for two years before beginning a second university career.\nThis time he went, not to Rome but to the University of Bologna. He studied there during the years\n1872\n-\n73\n, then moved to Pisa where he attended the Scuola Normale Superiore which, under\nBetti\n's leadership, was becoming the leading Italian centre for mathematical research and mathematical education. As well as attending lectures by\nBetti\nin Pisa, Ricci-Curbastro also attended lectures by\nDini\n. In\n1875\nRicci-Curbastro was awarded a doctorate for his thesis\nOn\nFuchs\n's research concerning linear\ndifferential equations\n. He remained at Pisa working on a paper which he presented the following year to fulfil the requirements necessary to teach. The paper was\nOn a generalisation of\nRiemann\n's problem concerning\nhypergeometric functions\n. Neither this paper, nor his doctoral thesis, have been published.\nA perceptive reader will have noticed that both of these first two works by Ricci-Curbastro were based on works by German, rather than by Italian, mathematicians. The next pieces of work which he undertook were, likewise, not based on ideas by Italian mathematicians. The first was a series of articles on\nMaxwell\n's theory of electrodynamics and the work of\nClausius\nwhich\nBetti\nasked him to write. Three of these articles appeared in\nNuovo Cimento\nin\n1877\nand, in the same year, an article appeared in\nGiornale di matematiche di Battaglini\nwhich\nDini\nhad asked him to write on\nLagrange\n's problem on a system of linear differential equations.\nRicci-Curbastro now competed for a scholarship and he won one which allowed him to spend the year\n1877\n-\n78\nabroad. That he chose to go to Germany should be no surprise and in fact he chose to study at the Technische Hochschule in Munich where\nKlein\nhad been appointed to the chair two years earlier. As well as\nKlein\n,\nBrill\nworked at the Technische Hochschule in Munich and Ricci-Curbastro attended lectures by both these famous mathematicians. As Speziali writes in\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nRicci greatly admired\nKlein\n, and his esteem was soon reciprocated; nevertheless, Ricci does not seem to have been decisively influenced by Klein's teaching. It was, rather,\nRiemann\n,\nChristoffel\n, and\nLipschitz\nwho inspired his future research. Indeed, their influence on him was even greater than that of his Italian teachers.\nReturning to Pisa in\n1879\n, Ricci-Curbastro became\nDini\n's assistant. Then, from\n1880\nuntil his death in\n1925\nhe was professor of mathematical physics at the University of Padua. He did not only teach mathematical physics, however, for from\n1891\nhe also taught courses on advanced algebra at Padua. It was only after he was appointed to the chair at Padua that he had the security that would allow him to marry and, in\n1884\n, he married Bianca Bianchi Azzarani. They had three children; two sons and a daughter.\nRicci-Curbastro's early work was in mathematical physics, particularly on the laws of electric circuits and differential equations. He changed area somewhat to undertake research in\ndifferential geometry\nand was the inventor of the absolute differential calculus between\n1884\nand\n1894\n. The initial contributions had been made by\nGauss\n, then the ideas had been developed in\nRiemann\n's\n1854\nProbevorlesung\nⓉ\n(\nTest lecture\n)\nand in an\n1861\npaper which he wrote for a prize contest of the Paris\nAcadémie des Sciences\n. However, it was a paper of\nChristoffel\n, published in\nCrelle's Journal\nin\n1868\n, which was the main influence on Ricci-Curbastro to begin his investigations in\n1884\non quadratic differential forms. He first systematically presented the important ideas in\n1888\nin a paper written for the\n800\nth\nanniversary of the University of Bologna. Speziali writes in\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nThe method he used to demonstrate\n[\nthe invariance of the quadratics\n]\nled him to the technique of absolute differential calculus, which he discussed in its entirety in four publications written between\n1888\nand\n1892\n.\nMuch of Ricci-Curbastro's work after\n1900\nwas done jointly with his student\nLevi-Civita\n. In a fundamental joint paper that year\nMéthodes de calcul différentiel absolu et leurs applications\nⓉ\n(\nAbsolute differential calculus methods and their applications\n)\nhe used\n(\nfor the only time\n)\nthe name Ricci instead of his full name. This paper had been requested five years earlier by\nKlein\n. The authors state their aims in the preface to their important seventy-seven page paper:-\nThe algorithm of absolute differential calculus, the instrument matériel of the methods ... can be found complete in a remark due to\nChristoffel\n. But the methods themselves and the advantages they offer have their raison d'être and their source in the intimate relationships that join them to the notion of an\nn\nn\nn\n-dimensional variety, which we owe to the brilliant minds of\nGauss\nand\nRiemann\n. ... Being thus associated in an essential way with\nV\nn\nV_{n}\nV\nn\n​\n, it is the natural instrument of all those studies that have as their subject, such a variety, or in which one encounters as a characteristic element a positive quadratic form of the differentials of\nn\nn\nn\nvariables or of their derivatives.\nIn the paper, applications are given by Ricci-Curbastro and\nLevi-Civita\nto the classification of the\nquadratic forms\nof differentials and there are other analytic applications; they give applications to geometry including the theory of surfaces and\ngroups\nof motions; and mechanical applications including dynamics and solutions to\nLagrange\n's equations. The main ideas of this paper are discussed in\n[\n1\n]\n. Ricci-Curbastro's absolute differential calculus became the foundation of\ntensor analysis\nand was used by\nEinstein\nin his theory of general relativity.\nThe paper\n[\n7\n]\n, written by Ricci-Curbastro's student\nLevi-Civita\n, lists sixty-one of his publications. However, he found time to also contribute to local government as did many of the Italian mathematicians of his time. He served as a councillor for his home town of Lugo and in this capacity was involved in many projects relating to the supply of water and to swamp drainage\n(\nan activity which many Italian mathematicians became involved with over several centuries\n)\n. Later he served as a councillor for Padua and there his interests included school education and finance. Offered the position of mayor of Padua, however, he declined.\nRicci-Curbastro received many honours for his outstanding contributions, although one would have to say that the importance of his work was not fully understood at the time when he produced it, but rather it was realised some time later. He was honoured with membership of several academies such as the Istituto Veneto which he was admitted to in\n1892\nand which he served as president in\n1916\n-\n18\n. He also was a member of the\nAccademia dei Lincei\nfrom\n1899\n, the Accademia di Padua from\n1905\n, the\nAcademy of Sciences of Turin\nfrom\n1918\n, the\nSocietà dei Quaranta\nfrom\n1921\n, the Reale Accademia di Bologna from\n1922\nand the Accademia Pontifica from\n1925\n.",
