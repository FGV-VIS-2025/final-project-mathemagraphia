  "biografia": "Jean-Claude Bouquet\n's father was a farmer in the Doubs region of France. Jean-Claude became a school friend of\nBriot\n, who was also brought up in the Doubs region, and he went on to work with him for much of his life, collaborating both in teaching and in research. In fact Bouquet was two years younger than\nBriot\nbut they became friends at the Lycée since both had a fascination for mathematics. Both felt that they wanted to become teachers of mathematics. Bouquet was brought up in a period of unrest with the revolution of\n1830\n. Then during the years he was attending the Lycée there were many disturbances with fighting in the streets of Paris and Lyon on many occasions as enemies of the regime tried to overthrow it by force. However by the time Bouquet went to Paris to enter university there, France had entered a period of political stability and relative prosperity.\nBouquet entered the École Normale Supérieure in\n1839\n, obtaining his doctorate in\n1842\nfor a thesis\nSur la variation des intégrales doubles\nⓉ\n(\nOn the variation of double integrals\n)\nwhich he submitted to the Faculty of Science in Paris.\nBriot\nhad been a school teacher of mathematics for a year before entering the École Normale Supérieure and he took one year longer to obtain his doctorate than Bouquet so the two friends obtained their doctorates in the same year. Their careers then took very similar courses.\nBouquet was appointed professor of mathematics at the Lycée in Marseilles, then he went to Lyon as professor of mathematics in the Faculty of Science. In Lyon he met up again with his school friend\nBriot\nand the two began a collaboration which lasted throughout their careers. Bouquet returned to Paris shortly before Louis-Napoleon declared himself emperor of the French on\n2\nDecember\n1852\n; the Second Empire lasted until\n1870\n.  From\n1852\nuntil\n1858\nBouquet taught at the Lycée Bonaparte\n(\nlater renamed the Lycée\nCondorcet\n)\nin Paris. Again he was a colleague of\nBriot\nand both taught the special mathematics course designed to prepare pupils to take the entrance examinations of the École Normale Supérieure and the École Polytechnique. In\n1858\nBouquet moved to the Lycée Louis-le-Grand, the school\nGalois\nhad graduated from\n30\nyears before, and there again put his energies into preparing pupils for the entrance examinations for the two major Paris universities. He taught there until\n1867\nwhen he was appointed maître de conference\n(\nessentially an assistant lecturer\n)\nat the École Normale Supérieure and as répétiteur at the École Polytechnique. In\n1874\nBouquet was appointed professor of differential and integral calculus at the Sorbonne, succeeding\nSerret\nwho had retired due to ill health. Bouquet taught there until\n1884\n, the year before his death.\nBouquet worked on\ndifferential geometry\n, writing on orthogonal surfaces\nNote sur les surfaces orthogonales\nⓉ\n(\nNote on orthogonal surfaces\n)\n(1946)\n. In the same year he wrote an important memoirs on systems of lines of spaces\nRemarques sur les systèmes de droites dans l'espace\nⓉ\n(\nRemarks on systems of lines in space\n)\nthen he published at Lyon in\n1848\nMémoire sur propriétés d'un systèmes de droites\nⓉ\n(\nMemoir on properties on systems of straight lines\n)\n. This work was carried forward by\nBonnet\n,\nDarboux\nand\nCayley\n. With\nBriot\nhe worked from\n1853\nonwards on deep studies of\nCauchy\n's ideas of analysis and produced many fundamental papers on series expansions of functions and on\nelliptic functions\n. In\n1853\nthey established conditions for a function to be expandable into an entire series in their important paper\nNote sur le développement des fonctions en séries convergentes, ordonnées suivant les puissances croissantes de la variable\nⓉ\n(\nNote on the development of functions in convergent series, ordered in increasing powers of the variable\n)\n.\nBouquet and\nBriot\ndeveloped\nCauchy\n's work on the existence of integrals of a\ndifferential equation\n. Together they wrote several important texts. For example\nÉtude des fonctions d'une variable imaginaire\nⓉ\n(\nStudy of the functions of an imaginary variable\n)\n; <\n(\nResearch on the properties of functions defined by differential equations\n)\n; and\nMémoire sur l'intégration des équations différentielles au moyen des fonctions elliptiques\n. Between\n1859\nand\n1875\nBouquet worked with\nBriot\non elliptic functions and Bouquet published an excellent text\nThéorie des fonctions elliptiques\nⓉ\n(\nTheory of elliptic functions\n)\nin\n1875\n. In the year that he published this text he was elected to the\nAcademy of Sciences\nin Paris.\nBouquet was as enthusiastic a teacher as he was researcher. There is no doubt that he enjoyed teaching at both secondary school and university level as much as he enjoyed the deep research he undertook. It is worth commenting that although today joint research papers are the norm, this was certainly not the case in the time in which Bouquet worked. It says much about his character that he enjoyed collaborative research.\nJules Tannery\n, who was to write an obituary of Bouquet\n[\n2\n]\n, was taught by him and praised him highly as a teacher.",
