  "biografia": "Axel Harnack\n's parents were Theodosius Andreas Harnack\n(1817\n-\n1889)\nand Anna Carolina Maria Ewers\n(1828\n-\n1857)\n, known as Maria. Theodosius, born in St Petersburg, Russia, was appointed as a\ndocent\nin church history at the University of Dorpat in\n1843\nand, by the time Axel was born, he was Professor of Practical and Systemic Theology there. We note that Dorpat is today known as Tartu, a city in Estonia. The University of Dorpat was in a slightly unusual position since Estonia had been controlled by Sweden and by Russia at different periods and, at this time, it was controlled by Russia. However, teaching at the university was in the German language and, although the finance and administration of the university was from Russia, its academic leanings were towards Germany with the majority of the professors being German.\nTheodosius and Maria Harnack had five children, one daughter and four sons. The eldest child was a daughter who died at the age of nineteen but the four sons all went on to become leaders in their own academic areas. The children were: Anna Harnack\n(1849\n-\n1868)\n; Karl Gustav Adolf von Harnack\n(1851\n-\n1930)\n(\nknown as Adolf\n)\nwho became a Lutheran theologian and a church historian; Karl Gustav Axel Harnack\n(1851\n-\n1888)\n(\nknown as Axel\n)\n, the subject of this biography; Friedrich Moritz Erich Harnack\n(1852\n-\n1915)\n(\nknown as Erich\n)\nwho studied medicine and became a pharmacologist, and Rudolf Gottfried Otto Harnack\n(1857\n-\n1914)\n(\nknown as Otto\n)\nwho became a professor of history, literature and aesthetics\n(\nhe committed suicide on\n22\nMarch\n1914)\n. We note that Adolf and Axel were twins. After the death of Axel's mother Anna in\n1857\n, when Axel was six years old, his father Theodosius married Helene Klementine Amalie von Maydell\n(1834\n-\n1923)\n.\nHarnack was brought up in Erlangen in Bavaria since his father had been appointed as professor at the Frederick Alexander University of Erlangen in\n1853\nwhen Axel was two years old. The family remained in Erlangen until\n1866\nwhen they returned to Dorpat. Axel completed his schooling in Dorpat then, in\n1869\n, he began his university studies in mathematics and physics at the University of Dorpat. There he was taught physics by Arthur Joachim von Oettingen\n(1836\n-\n1920)\nwho had studied physics and astronomy at Dorpat before studying further in Paris and Berlin. He had been appointed Professor of Physics at Dorpat in\n1868\n, the year before Harnack began his university career. Harnak's main mathematics teacher was\nFerdinand Minding\nwho had studied and then taught at the University of Berlin before being appointed as Professor of Mathematics at Dorpat in\n1843\n. Harnack was an outstanding student and, in\n1872\nhe was awarded a prize for a geometrical dissertation which has never been published.\nHaving spent thirteen years growing up in Erlangen, it was a natural choice for Harnack that, after graduating from Dorpat, he went to Erlangen to write his doctoral thesis. Although Erlangen was not a major mathematical centre at this time, the young\nFelix Klein\nhad been appointed there as professor in\n1872\nand he was a natural adviser for Harnack. We note that although\nKlein\nwas a professor, he was only two years older than his student Harnack! The research project that\nKlein\ngave Harnack was to further investigate the parametric representation of the third-order curves which had been introduced by\nAlfred Clebsch\n. Harnack did excellent work and his thesis\nÜber die Verwerthung der elliptischen Functionen für die Geometrie der Curven dritten Grades\nⓉ\n(\nOn using elliptic functions for the geometry of curves of the third degree\n)\nwas published in\nMathematische Annalen\nin\n1875\n. In fact Harnack published four papers in\n1875\n, the other three being\nZur Theorie der ternären cubischen Formen\nⓉ\n(\nOn the theory of ternary cubic forms\n)\n,\nÜber einen Beweis des Abel'schen Theorem\nⓉ\n(\nOn a Proof of Abel's Theorem\n)\n, and\nÜber eine Behandlungsweise der algebraischen Differentiale in homogen Coordinaten\nⓉ\n(\nOn a method of treatment of algebraic differentials in homogeneous coordinates\n)\n. The last mentioned of these papers was, in fact, Harnack's\nhabilitation\nthesis which he submitted to the University of Leipzig where he earned his right to teach and was appointed as a docent in\n1875\n.\nFor a list of Harnack's papers and books, see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nAfter only a year at the University of Leipzig, Harnack was called to a chair of mathematics at the Polytechnic in Darmstadt in the autumn of\n1876\nbut he moved again after a year, this time being called to a chair of mathematics at the Polytechnic in Dresden in\n1877\n. However, in\n1877\n, while still in Darmstadt, he married Elisabeth von Oettingen. He held this professorship at the Polytechnic in Dresden for the rest of his career. Moritz Kassmann writes\n[\n8\n]\n:-\nIn Dresden his main task is to teach calculus. In several talks Harnack develops his own view of what the job of a university teacher should be: \"clear and complete treatment of the basic terminology, confinement of the pure theory and of applications to evident problems, precise statements of theorems under rather strong assumptions.\"\nHowever, his health deteriorated from around\n1883\n. In that year he went bathing in the sea and as a result got a chill that turned into a more serious illness which meant he had to stop teaching in\n1883\n. He went to Davos in Switzerland in an attempt to regain his health and indeed there was an improvement which allowed him to resume his teaching duties in Dresden at Easter\n1885\n. While in Davos he had continued to work on mathematics and made a translation of\nJoseph Serret\n's\nCours de calcul différentiel et intégral\nⓉ\n(\nCourse of differential and integral calculus\n)\ninto German. Harnack begins the preface to the German translation, published in\n1884\nas\nLehrbuch der Differential- und Integral- Rechnung\nⓉ\n(\nTextbook of differential and integral calculus\n)\n, writing:-\nAmong the textbooks on the differential and integral calculus which have been published in the course of the last decade,\nM Serret\n's work appears particularly suited to a first, fundamental, study; for it combines with great precision an extreme completeness in the applications of this theory.\nAlso in the Preface, written in\n1884\n, Harnack explains how he came to make the translation:-\nRecognizing that it is not possible to recommend to a student, who has to adopt new concepts, a textbook which is written in a foreign language, even if he has mastered it in the same way, I undertook this German treatment when I had to interrupt my teaching activity for a long time last autumn. I was given permission to do so by the gentleman, as well as by the publisher, Mr Gauthier-Villars, to whom I express my most grateful thanks.\nHarnack's book is not simply a translation since he added several long and significant comments. The time that Harnack spent in Davos, sadly, did not lead to a permanent cure, and the illness recurred in the summer of\n1887\n. Again he made a slow improvement and by December\n1887\nhe was well enough to travel to Leipzig to attend a meeting of the Academy there. By February\n1888\nhis condition had worsened again and he was not able to travel but he was still able to give his lectures at the Polytechnic in Dresden.\nHarnack had published the book\nDie Elemente der Differential- und Integralrechnung. Zur Einführung in das Studium\nⓉ\n(\nThe elements of differential and integral calculus. Introduction to the study\n)\nin\n1881\nand George L Cathcart had approached Harnack in March\n1888\nto see if he would be happy for him to publish an English translation of the text. Harnack replied to Cathcart in letter dated\n15\nMarch\n1888\nabout the English translation, wishing to make some changes in the material in the book for the new English edition. An extract from Harnack's letter is available at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nHarnack had been hoping to spend the Easter vacation in the north of Italy and Cathcart replied saying that he too would be in north Italy for the Easter vacation and suggested they meet there during the vacation. However, on\n16\nMarch Harnack collapsed when in the middle of giving a lecture at the Polytechnic. On\n21\nMarch he wrote to Cathcart:-\nI can propose no definite engagement to meet you in Italy, as I have been ill for a week, and my journey has therefore become uncertain.\nThey never managed to meet in Italy since Harnack died in Dresden on\n3\nApril.\nYou can read Cathcart's translation of Harnack's Preface to his calculus book at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nWe note in passing, that this English translation contains the first known use of the phrase \"neighbourhood of a point\":-\nWith the foregoing considerations we have attained the conception of the region or neighbourhood of a point. By it we mean an arbitrarily small but still always finite interval at both sides of the value x.\nHarnack's mathematical contributions are significant and, although some of the results he published were false since he made an assumption that two concepts were the same when, in fact, they were subtly different, nevertheless his work is important in the development of integration theory. We saw that he began his research career working on geometry but it seems that, during his year at Darmstadt, he moved towards research in analysis. His\n1881\nbook on differential and integral calculus was widely appreciated and, as we mentioned above, was translated into English.\nAn indication of the importance of Harnack's contributions can be seen from the fact that\n(\nin March\n2017)\nMathSciNet lists\n738\npapers with \"Harnack\" in the title. Most of these refer to the Harnack inequality or to the Harnack principle\n(\nsometimes known as Harnack's theorem\n)\n. If one looks at how many papers in MathSciNet have a review which contains Harnack's name, one finds there are\n1926\n. The Harnack inequality appears in his\n1887\nbook\nDie Grundlagen der Theorie des logarithmischen Potentiales und der eindeutigen Potentialfunction in der Ebene\nⓉ\n(\nThe foundations of the theory of the logarithmic potential and the unique potential function in the plane.\n)\n. The inequality relates the values of a positive harmonic function at two points on a closed ball. The Harnack principle may be stated as:-\nIf a monotone sequence of harmonic functions in a bounded domain converges at some point in the domain, then it converges at all points of the domain to a harmonic function, and this convergence is uniform on any closed subdomain of the domain.\nThis principle, also in his\n1887\nbook, together with the inequality form the starting point for a very rich and beautiful theory which explains the large number of publications with \"Harnack\" in the title.",
