  "biografia": "Federico Cafiero\n's parents were from Meta di Sorrento. Federico was born in Riposto, a town on the east coast of Sicily, about\n30\nkm north of the town of Catania. He studied mathematics at the Università degli Studi di Napoli Federico II\n(\nthe University of Naples\n)\nwhere he was taught by\nRenato Caccioppoli\n,\nErnesto Pascal\n,\nGianfranco Cimmino\nand others.\nCaccioppoli\nwas certainly impressed by his young student and referred to Cafiero as his favourite pupil. Cafiero obtained his laurea, with distinction, in\n1939\nand following this he won the Istituto Nazionale di Alta Matematica scholarship, to the value of\n5000\nItalian liras, which allowed him to study for a year in Rome at La Sapienza Università di Roma. He spent the year\n1939\n-\n40\nat the newly founded Istituto Nazionale di Alta Matematica in Rome and during this year he attended lectures by\nLuigi Fantappiè\n, Giulio Krall,\nMauro Picone\n,\nFrancesco Severi\nand\nLeonida Tonelli\nwho, although officially on the staff at Pisa, spent three days in Rome each week covering for\nFederigo Enriques\nwho had been dismissed under the Fascist Manifesto della razza\n(\nManifesto of Race\n)\nenacted in July\n1938\n. After this year of deep study, Cafiero was appointed to teach the 'Elements of Mathematics' course in the Statistical Science Faculty in Rome. This appointment was supposed to be for a period of three years but, soon after taking up the position, his academic career was interrupted by World War II.\nItaly did not enter World War II following the German invasion of Poland in September\n1939\nand they kept out of the war for the first few months. However, Italy joined the hostilities of World War II, declaring war on Britain and France on\n10\nJune\n1940\n, only days before France surrendered to the Germans. Cafiero had only been teaching the 'Elements of Mathematics' course for a few months when he was called up to serve in the Italian army in January\n1941\n. After training, in May\n1942\n, now an officer in the San Marco Battalion, he was sent to Bomba in North Africa. The first military actions that the Battalion was involved with after this was the Battle of El Abd in June\n1942\n. It was a convincing victory for the Italian and German troops and the Allies suffered a heavy defeat. The Battalion was then stationed in Tobruk, defending the coastal region. Attacked by the British while in Tobruk in September, the Battalion bravely defended the town. However, towards the end of that year and in January\n1943\nthey retreated toward Tunisia. In April\n1943\nthe Battalion was heavily defeated in the battle of the Oidane-el-Hachana line. Cafiero's unit was caught by surprise by the turn of events with many of the Italian soldiers being captured by the Allies. However Cafiero had his men sail from North Africa to the Italian coast in a rubber dingy reaching Trapani in Sicily. For this act of bravery he was awarded the Silver Medal of Military Valour.\nMussolini was deposed in July\n1943\nfollowing the Allied invasion of Sicily. This was largely due to Pietro Badoglio who became prime minister, and arranged an unconditional surrender to the Allies in September\n1943\n. The Fascist party was dissolved and Italy declared war on Germany in October. However, German armies defended Italy against the Allied advance from the south. In October the Allies entered Naples but their advance was stopped at this point. Cafiero reached Naples but was unable to move further north. He was discharged from the army in February\n1944\nand, still unable to return to his position in Rome, remained in Naples. During the occupation of Naples by the allied troops, the buildings of the Faculty of Mathematics, Physics and Natural Sciences, located in the Via Mezzocannone, were requisitioned and used by the U.S. Army Military Police. They continued to occupy these buildings until Rome fell to the Allies in June\n1944\n. It was impossible to move around Italy during these years of violent conflict and half of the mathematicians employed at the University of Naples were unable to reach the city. Only two mathematicians,\nMiranda\nand\nCaccioppoli\ntogether with the astronomer Vittorio Nobile, were teaching there at this time, with one further mathematician, G Andreoli, suspended by the Allies because of his uncompromising adherence to fascism. Cafiero, in the role of an assistant, was able to help with the reconstruction of the University of Naples. In\n1944\nhe married his long-time sweetheart Jole Giorgini; they had one child, a daughter Anna.\nMiranda\nand\nCaccioppoli\n, with Cafiero's help, began to rebuild mathematics at the University of Naples.\nCaccioppoli\nhad no practical or organisational skills but\nMiranda\nhad a clear vision of how he wanted to develop mathematics based on an Institute of Mathematics with a single well stocked library. The Institute began to operate from\n1944\n, with\nMiranda\nas its director and Cafiero, as an assistant, was one of the few members of staff. The situation in Naples was an extremely difficult one. Although many books had survived the war, they were randomly piled up and the old library catalogues had been destroyed. The academics were only supported by two old janitors, so it fell to a young assistant like Cafiero to undertake hard physical work. The teaching load during the post-war years was particularly heavy for the few academics who had to try to put on a full programme with very little in the way of resources. Although Cafiero was only an assistant at first, in\n1951\nhe was appointed as professor in analysis. He had begun published papers during this period, the first of these being\nSull'approssimazione mediante poligonali degli integrali del sistema differenziale:\ny\n′\n=\nF\n(\nx\n,\ny\n)\n,\ny\n(\nx\n0\n)\n=\ny\n0\ny' = F(x, y), y(x_{0}) = y_{0}\ny\n′\n=\nF\n(\nx\n,\ny\n)\n,\ny\n(\nx\n0\n​\n)\n=\ny\n0\n​\nⓉ\n(\nOn the polygonal approximation of the integrals of the differential system:  y' = F\n(\nx, y\n)\n, y\n(\nx\n0\n)\n= y\n0\n)\n(1947)\n, which, under the assumption that\nF\n(\nx\n,\ny\n)\nF(x, y)\nF\n(\nx\n,\ny\n)\nis continuous in a rectangle, develops a method of polygonal approximation which produces every solution of the system specified in the title. His next paper was\nUn'osservazione sulla continuitá rispetto ai valori iniziali degli integrali dell'equazione:\ny\n′\n=\nf\n(\nx\n,\ny\n)\ny' = f (x, y)\ny\n′\n=\nf\n(\nx\n,\ny\n)\n(1947)\n, which proves that any group of conditions sufficient to assure the existence and uniqueness, with respect to the initial values, of the integral of the equation\ny\n′\n=\nf\n(\nx\n,\ny\n)\ny' = f (x, y)\ny\n′\n=\nf\n(\nx\n,\ny\n)\nis also sufficient to assure the continuous dependence of the solution on the initial values. In each of the years\n1948\n,\n1949\nand\n1950\n, Cafiero published three papers most of which studied ordinary differential equations.\nIn\n1953\nCafiero entered the competition for the chair of analysis at the University of Catania and the panel of assessors ranked him in first place. He took up this appointment in\n1953\n, returning to Sicily and the area of his birth. In the same year of\n1953\nhis first book was published namely\nFunzioni additive d'insieme ed integrazione negli spazi astratti\nⓉ\n(\nGeneral additive functions and integration in abstract spaces\n)\n. In this work he used an approach, and notation, similar to that found in\nStanisław Saks\n's book\nTheory of the integral\n(\npublished in Polish in\n1933\nwith an English translation in\n1937)\n. He generalised the\nVitali\nconvergence theorem and the\nFichera\nconvergence theorem. His first major paper giving his convergence theorem was\nSul passaggio al limite sotto il segno d'integrale per successioni d'integrali di Stieltjes-Lebesgue negli spazi astratti, con masse variabili con gli integrandi\nⓉ\n(\nOn the passage to the limit under the integral sign for sequences of Stieltjes-Lebesgue in abstract spaces, with varying masses as integrands\n)\n(1953)\n. His\n1953\nbook gave a more leisurely approach to presenting his convergence theorems. Cafiero only spent three years in Catania before moving to Pisa in\n1956\n.\nAlessandro Faedo\nhad been appointed to succeed\nLeonida Tonelli\nat Pisa in\n1946\nand he began a series of inspired appointments, building Pisa into one of the leading mathematical centres in the world. The appointment of Cafiero, who succeeded\nFrancesco Cecioni\n, to the University of Pisa also meant that he taught at the Scuola Normale. In\n1953\n, the year Cafiero joined the Institute at Pisa,\nFaedo\nbecame Dean of the Faculty of Science so Cafiero became director of the Mathematical Institute from the time he was appointed.\nIn\n1954\nEnrico Fermi\nwrote to the rector of the University of Pisa, Enrico Avanzi, suggesting that the university should build its own electronic computer. Avanzi set up the Centro Studi Calcolatrici Elettroniche headed by\nFaedo\nwith a team which included mathematicians, physicists and electrical engineers. Cafiero was a member of this team which was given the task of designing and building an electronic computer. The Calcolatrice Elettronica Pisana was completed in\n1961\nbut Cafiero had left Pisa two years before this. Given the exciting mathematical developments that were happening in Pisa, at first it might seem a little strange that Cafiero chose to move after only three years. However, the reason he moved was that in May\n1959\nRenato Caccioppoli\ncommitted suicide and Naples advertised a competition to fill his chair. Naples held a special affection for Cafiero who, although a Sicilian by birth, considered Naples as his adopted home\n(\nit was, of course, also the nearest city to his parents' home town\n)\n. Also, having been\nCaccioppoli\n's favourite student, he had a special reason to want to succeed to his chair at Naples. In fact this was the last move that Cafiero made, spending the last twenty years of his life in Naples.\nCafiero played an important role in building a vigorous mathematical school at Naples which included\n(\nin alphabetical order\n)\nLuigi Albano, Ugo Barbuti, Antonio Chffi, Paolo De Lucia, Nicola Fedele, Renato Fiorenza, Francesco Guglielmino, Giuseppe Pulvirenti, Giuseppe Santagati and Antonio Zitarosa. We have already seen that Cafiero made contributions to the theory of ordinary differential equations and to the theory of measure and integration. We mentioned above his book on integration published in\n1953\n. He published a more major monograph on this topic in\n1959\n, the year he took up the chair at Naples. This book was\nMisura e integrazione\nⓉ\n(\nMeasure and integration\n)\nand it was reviewed by Laurence Chisholm Young who pointed out its strengths and weaknesses:-\nThis is stated to be based on an earlier monograph Funzioni additive d'insieme ed integrazione negli spazi astratti\nⓉ\n(\nGeneral additive functions and integration in abstract spaces\n)\n(1953)\n. The old title is much more appropriate, except insofar as the terminology is now that of lattice theory. The fact is that the book, in spite of its size, covers only a part of the theory of measure and integration. On the one hand, the abstract setting is still limited to sets of actual points, and to functions in the usual sense, so that the lattice aspects do not go as far as the\nCarathéodory\nalgebraization of the whole theory. On the other hand, this setting, to which the author restricts himself throughout, excludes all those parts of the subject which depend on a topology, so that there are no\nDenjoy\nintegrals, no ordinary derivatives, no strong density theorems, and so on. Nor is there any mention of the deeper questions about measure, for instance, those related to the\ncontinuum hypothesis\n, and generally there are only the barest references to historical and philosophical matters, and to the motivation of the concepts. ... it is, within its framework, fairly self-sufficient, and moreover, very copiously illustrated by special cases.\nHis other contributions mainly involve the theory of functions of a real variable and its application to the foundations of the theory of functions of a complex variable. Among the books by Cafiero, which he published during his years in the chair at Naples, are the popular works:\nElementi di analisi matematica e geometria analitica\nⓉ\n(\nElements of mathematical analysis and analytic geometry\n)\n(1966)\n;\nLezioni di analisi matematica\nⓉ\n(\nLessons in mathematical analysis\n)\n(1964\n,\n1968)\n;\nElementi di teoria degli insiemi\nⓉ\n(\nElements of the theory of sets\n)\n(1977)\n; and\nI numeri e le funzioni numeriche elementari\nⓉ\n(\nNumbers and elementary numerical functions\n)\n(1978)\n.\nCafiero was an enthusiastic believer in educational reform particularly in the universities. He served as a member of the Consiglio Superiore della Pubblica Istruzione from\n1966\nto\n1978\n. Together with his colleague Antonio Zitarosa, he founded a series devoted to works in mathematical analysis published by Liguori of Naples. Finally, we note that the obituary\n[\n4\n]\nis written by Giorgio Letta who was a student of Cafiero's during the years he worked at Pisa. This obituary describes in detail Cafiero's contributions to the theory of measurable functions, which is considered to be his most important work. The paper\n[\n4\n]\ngives the list of Cafiero's publications which contains\n41\nitems.\nTwo notable awards the Cafiero received for his mathematical contributions were the Tenore prize of the Accademia Pontaniana\n(\nawarded in\n1953\nfor his monograph\nFunzioni additive d'insieme e integrazione negli spazi astratti\nⓉ\n(\nGeneral additive functions and integration in abstract spaces\n)\n)\nand the Golden medal 'Benemeriti della Scuola, della Cultura, dell'Arte' which he received from the President of the Italian Republic in\n1976\n.",
