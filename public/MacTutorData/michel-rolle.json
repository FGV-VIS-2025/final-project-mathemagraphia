  "biografia": "Michel Rolle\n's father was a shopkeeper. Michel had little formal education being largely self-educated after receiving some elementary schooling. He worked as a transcriber for a notary and then as an assistant to several attorneys in the district around his home town of Ambert. In\n1675\n, probably seeking a better life, he went to Paris where he worked as a scribe and arithmetical expert. However, quite soon after he arrived in Paris he married and children quickly followed. His income was not sufficient to support his growing family but he had been studying higher mathematics on his own and it was the skill that he had developed in this discipline which provided the breakthrough.\nIn\n1682\nhe achieved a certain fame by solving a problem which had been publicly posed by\nJacques Ozanam\n. Jean-Baptiste Colbert, the controller general of finance and secretary of state for the navy under King Louis XIV of France, rewarded Rolle for this achievement. Colbert arranged a pension for Rolle which started him on the road to financial security, but there were other equally important consequences\n[\n6\n]\n:-\nOf equal importance with the financial benefits to which Rolle's prize led, was the fact that it brought him to the notice of Louvois who happened to be looking for someone to teach mathematics to one of his sons. Rolle was hired by Louvois, who came to be greatly impressed by his pedagogic and mathematical skills. From\n1783\nonwards Louvois was in a position to confer further scientific patronage on his protégé and did so when he made Rolle a member of the Académie in\n1685\n.\nThe problem which Rolle solved was posed in the\nJournal des sçavans\non\n31\nAugust\n1682\nby\nJacques Ozanam\n; it was the following:-\nFind four numbers the difference of any two being a perfect square, in addition the sum of the first three numbers being a perfect square.\nOzanam\nstated that the smallest of the four numbers with these properties would have at least\n50\ndigits, but Rolle found four numbers satisfying the conditions with each number having seven digits. He made his solution known through publishing it in the\nJournal des sçavans\n. Louvois, who is referred to in the above quote, was François Michel le Tellier, Marquis de Louvois, the French Secretary of State for War. He employed Rolle to tutor his fourth son, Camille le Tellier\n(1675\n-\n1718)\n. The Marquis de Louvois arranged for Rolle to have an administrative post in the Ministry of War, but Rolle disliked the work and soon resigned. Rolle was elected to the\nAcadémie Royale des Sciences\nin\n1685\nand the impressive mathematical work he produced following his election fully justified the Marquis de Louvois' faith in him.\nBefore going on to discuss the interesting mathematical contributions Rolle made, let us give a couple of further facts about his life. He became a Pensionnaire Géometre of the\nAcadémie des Sciences\nin\n1699\n. In\n1708\nRolle suffered a stroke. He recovered his health fairly well but his mental capacity was diminished and he made no further mathematical contributions after this stroke. He survived for eleven years after this first stroke but in\n1719\nhe suffered a second stroke which proved fatal.\nLet us now look at Rolle's important mathematical contributions. He worked on\nDiophantine analysis\n, algebra\n(\nusing methods of\nClaude Gaspar Bachet de Méziriac\ninvolving the use of the\nEuclidean algorithm\n)\nand, to a lesser extent, on geometry. He published his most important work\nTraité d'algèbre\nⓉ\n(\nTreatise on algebra\n)\nin\n1690\non the theory of equations. In this treatise, he invented the notation\nx\nn\n\\sqrt[n]{x}\nn\nx\n​\nfor the\nn\nn\nn\nth root of\nx\nx\nx\nand, as a consequence, it became the standard notation; it is used today. In\nTraité d'algèbre\nⓉ\n(\nTreatise on algebra\n)\nRolle used the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of two polynomials. He also used it to solve Diophantine linear equations. Perhaps the most significant part of the work, however, is where he introduces the notion of 'cascades'. Let us see how this idea worked: If\nP\n(\nx\n)\n=\n0\nP(x) = 0\nP\n(\nx\n)\n=\n0\nis a given polynomial equation with real roots\na\na\na\nand\nb\nb\nb\nthen he constructs a polynomial\nP\n′\n(\nx\n)\nP'(x)\nP\n′\n(\nx\n)\n, which he called the 'first cascade,' so that\nP\n′\n(\nb\n)\n=\n(\nb\n−\na\n)\nQ\n(\nb\n)\nP'(b) = (b - a)Q(b)\nP\n′\n(\nb\n)\n=\n(\nb\n−\na\n)\nQ\n(\nb\n)\nwhere\nQ\n(\nx\n)\nQ(x)\nQ\n(\nx\n)\nis a polynomial of lower degree. Of course in our terminology\nP\n′\n(\nx\n)\nP'(x)\nP\n′\n(\nx\n)\nis the first derivative of\nP\n(\nx\n)\nP(x)\nP\n(\nx\n)\n. Rolle then constructs the 'second cascade' which is the second derivative, and continues in this fashion. Between any two consecutive roots of\nP\n(\nx\n)\nP(x)\nP\n(\nx\n)\nthere is a root of\nP\n′\n(\nx\n)\nP'(x)\nP\n′\n(\nx\n)\n, between any two consecutive roots of\nP\n′\n(\nx\n)\nP'(x)\nP\n′\n(\nx\n)\nthere is a root of\nP\n′\n′\n(\nx\n)\nP''(x)\nP\n′\n′\n(\nx\n)\n, etc. His method is to start with a given polynomial, make a linear transformation to obtain a polynomial all of whose roots are positive\n(\nhe never proves that his transformation always works but it does\n)\n, then to continue to construct the cascade of polynomials until a linear polynomial is reached. One can then move back up the cascade, finding approximately the roots of each polynomial. Julius Shain writes:-\nThe method of cascades has an important historical significance. Some basic principles of the calculus and the theory of equations can definitely be traced to their origin as incidental propositions of the method. It amplified the concepts of limits of roots of equations, provided the fundamentals from which\nMaclaurin\nderived his formula, began modern methods of series for determining roots, and discussed the relationship of imaginary roots in equations and their derivatives. Rolle's theorem, an important proposition of the calculus, also owes its origin to the method.\nIn fact Rolle is best remembered for 'Rolle's Theorem' which was published in\nDémonstration d'une Méthode pour resoudre les Egalitez de tous les degrez\nⓉ\n(\nDemonstration of a method for solving equations of all degrees\n)\nin\n1691\n. This work was written to provide proofs of certain methods\n(\nin particular the method of cascades\n)\nwhich he gave without justification in\nTraité d'algèbre\nⓉ\n(\nTreatise on algebra\n)\n. His proofs were based on methods introduced by\nJohann van Waveren Hudde\n. The familiar Rolle's Theorem states:\nIf\nf\n(\na\n)\n=\nf\n(\nb\n)\n=\n0\nf (a) = f (b) = 0\nf\n(\na\n)\n=\nf\n(\nb\n)\n=\n0\nthen\nf\n′\n(\nx\n)\n=\n0\nf '(x) = 0\nf\n′\n(\nx\n)\n=\n0\nfor some\nx\nx\nx\nwith\na\n≤\nx\n≤\nb\na ≤ x ≤ b\na\n≤\nx\n≤\nb\n.\nThe name 'Rolle's Theorem' was given to this basic result by\nGiusto Bellavitis\nin\n1846\n. In his\n1691\nwork Rolle adopted the notion that if\na\n>\nb\na > b\na\n>\nb\nthen\n−\nb\n>\n−\na\n-b > -a\n−\nb\n>\n−\na\n. It seems strange today to realise that this was not the current practice at the time but was in opposition to the ordering of the real numbers used by\nDescartes\nand others. Other notation Rolle used in his\n1691\nwork was the equals sign '='. This notation was not invented by Rolle, rather it was invented by\nRobert Recorde\n, but\nDescartes\nhad used a different notation and the sign = was not in common use. Rolle published another important work on solutions of indeterminate equations in\n1699\n,\nMéthode pour résoudre les équations indéterminées de l'algèbre\nⓉ\n(\nMethod for solving indeterminate algebraic qquations\n)\n.\nIt might be assumed from what we have just written about Rolle's work that he was developing the infinitesimal calculus. This would be a serious error, for Rolle described the infinitesimal calculus as a collection of ingenious fallacies and he believed that the methods could lead to errors. He begins his memoir\nDu nouveau systême de l'infini\nⓉ\n(\nOn the new infinity system\n)\n(1703)\nas follows\n(\nsee for example\n[\n4\n]\n)\n:-\nGeometry has always been considered as an exact science, and indeed as the source of the exactness which is widespread among other parts of mathematics. Among its principles one could only find true axioms and all the theorems and problems posed were either soundly demonstrated or capable of sound demonstration. And if any false or uncertain propositions were slipped into it they would immediately be banned from this science. But it seems that this feature of exactness doe not reign anymore in geometry since the new system of infinitely small quantities has been mixed to it. I do not see that this system has produced anything for the truth and it would seem to me that it often conceals mistakes.\nNow we should note that this memoir, although only published by the\nAcademy of Sciences\nin\n1703\n, actually contained material which had been used in the early stages of a vigorous debate which took place in the\nAcademy of Sciences\nin\n1700\n-\n01\n. This vigorous disagreement was between Rolle and\nPierre Varignon\nand it ended in uproar\n(\nsome say that Rolle's lack of breeding showed in his bad behaviour\n)\n. The\nAcademy\nset up a commission to decide which of the two mathematicians was correct but it failed to come to a definite conclusion. Michel Blay\n[\n2\n]\nwrites:-\nThis opposition, extremely active from\n1700\non, was led by Michel Rolle. The burden of his critique rested on two arguments, one stressing the inadequacy and the lack of logical rigour of the fundamental concepts and principles of the new calculus, the other pretending to show\n(\nwith the aid of cleverly selected examples\n)\nthat the new calculus led to error, insofar as it did not yield the same results obtained in the classical, algebraically inspired methods of\nFermat\nand, more especially,\nHudde\n.\nIn particular Rolle suggested that there were difficulties associated with the following axiom given by\nde l'Hôpital\nin\nAnalyse des infiniment petits pour l'intelligence des lignes courbes\nⓉ\n(\nAnalysis of infinitesimals for understanding curved lines\n)\n(1696)\n:-\nGrant that two quantities whose difference is an infinitely small quantity may be taken\n(\nor used\n)\nindifferently for each other; or\n(\nwhich is the same thing\n)\nthat a quantity which is increased or decreased only by an infinitesimally small quantity may be considered as remaining the same.\nFor example, Rolle addressed the\nAcademy\non\n12\nMarch and\n16\nMarch\n1701\n. He asked his audience to consider the curve\ny\n−\nb\n=\n(\nx\n2\n−\n2\na\nx\n+\na\n2\n−\nb\n2\n)\n2\n/\n3\na\n1\n/\n3\ny - b = \\Large\\frac{(x^2  - 2ax + a^2  - b^2 )^{2/3}} {a^{1/3} }\ny\n−\nb\n=\na\n1\n/\n3\n(\nx\n2\n−\n2\na\nx\n+\na\n2\n−\nb\n2\n)\n2\n/\n3\n​\n.\nHe then applied the new method of the infinitesimally small and found that\nd\ny\n=\n4\n(\nx\n−\na\n)\nd\nx\n3\n(\na\nx\n2\n−\n2\na\n2\nx\n+\na\n3\n−\na\nb\n2\n)\n1\n/\n3\ndy = \\Large\\frac{4(x - a)dx}{3(ax^2  - 2a^2 x + a^3  - ab^2 )^{1/3}}\nd\ny\n=\n3\n(\na\nx\n2\n−\n2\na\n2\nx\n+\na\n3\n−\na\nb\n2\n)\n1\n/\n3\n4\n(\nx\n−\na\n)\nd\nx\n​\nso that this method showed that the curve has a turning point at\nx\n=\na\nx = a\nx\n=\na\n. Rolle then applied\nHudde\n's method to show that the curve has turning points at three points,\nx\n=\na\n,\nx\n=\na\n−\nb\nx = a, x = a - b\nx\n=\na\n,\nx\n=\na\n−\nb\nand\nx\n=\na\n+\nb\nx = a + b\nx\n=\na\n+\nb\n. This is a cleverly constructed example, but\nVarignon\nwas able to see the subtle error in Rolle's analysis. He later replied\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nOne will obtain first x = a by setting dy =\n0\n; and second, x = a - b or x = a + b by making dy infinite in relation to dx or dx =\n0\n. When one sees that if the desired curve has some maximum or minimum that meets a tangent parallel to the\n[\nx-axis\n]\n, this can only be at the extremity of x = a; and that if it has one that meets ...\n[\ntangents\n]\nperpendicular to this axis, this can only be at the extremity of x = a - b and of x = a + b.\nAfter the\nAcademy\ndecided that no further discussion of this topic was take place, Rolle continued the argument in the pages of the\nJournal des sçavans\nopposed by\nJoseph Saurin\n. To his eternal credit, Rolle eventually conceded that he was wrong. He acknowledged this to\nVarignon\n,\nFontenelle\nand\nMalebranche\n. Jean Itard ends his article\n[\n1\n]\nwith the following assessment:-\nRolle was a skillful algebraist who broke with Cartesian techniques; and his opposition to infinitesimal methods, in the final analysis, was beneficial.",
