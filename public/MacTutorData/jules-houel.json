  "biografia": "The first thing to discuss is the spelling of\nJules Hoüel\n's surname. One finds the spelling Houel, Hoüel, Hoûel or Houël but deciding which is 'correct' shows immediately the problem. On his birth certificate his name appears as Houël but it appears as Hoüel on his baccalaureate certificate, and all his published papers and books give the Hoüel version. When he signed his name it usually looks like Hoüel but sometimes it appears as Hoûel. Some official documents show his name as Houel. We believe, therefore, that the correct spelling of the family name is Houël but the subject of this biography preferred the Hoüel version. We have chosen to use Hoüel which appears to be in line with Jules Hoüel's wishes but use the Houël version when giving details of his family.\nJules Hoüel was the son of Jean Baptiste Houël\n(1795\n-\n1854)\nand Elisabeth Amicie Tranchant\n(1805\n-\n1877)\n. Jean Baptiste Houël, the son of Louis Nicolas Houël\n(1758\n-\n1832)\n, mayor of Thaon, and Anne Donnet\n(1758\n-\n1832)\n, had intended to study at the École Polytechnique but stopped his studies because of the political situation. He went to his family home in Bombanville and lived there as a country gentleman, painting and drawing a great deal. In\n1822\n, he married Elisabeth Amicie Tranchant, the daughter of Dr François Tranchant\n(1771\n-\n1842)\n, a doctor of medicine, and Mary Magdalene Bonne Artur de Hauterue\n(1778\n-\n1857)\n, heiress and owner of Castle of Périers sur le Dan near Thaon. After marrying, Jean Baptiste and Elisabeth lived sometimes at Bombanville, sometimes at Périers at their parents' home, but by\n1823\n, around the time Jules was born, they only lived at Bombanville. In\n1832\n, when Jules was nine years old, his brother Louis Edmond Houël\n(1823\n-\n1904)\nwas born.\nAs a young child, Jules had very poor health, suffered severe headaches and swelling of his glands. His health was so poor that he could not attend school until he was fifteen years old. He was taught at home, first by his grandfather Louis Nicolas Houël but after his death, Jules continued to be taught by his father. Jean Baptiste Houël wrote in a letter of\n1841\n(\nsee\n[\n3\n]\n)\n:-\nI pushed my son to mathematics as far as the studies I had made when I was planning to enter the École Polytechnique, while my father, now deceased, came to the point that he did also progress in the Latin language and translated with enough ease authors such as Virgil, Ovid, Cicero\n[\n...\n]\nwhat I say is not to boast certainly, but only to let you know that with his grandfather, who was his first master, and then me, he did not quite waste his time.\nHis father also taught Jules to play the flute and to paint.\nIn October\n1838\nJules began his schooling, entering the third grade of the Royal College of Caen. He boarded at the school during the week, returning home to Bombanville each weekend. In his first year he studied Latin, Greek, French, history, and cosmography. In his second year French, Latin, mathematics, physics and natural history. As might be expected, his best subjects were mathematics and physics. He was awarded his baccalaureate in\n1841\nand decided to spend two years preparing to sit the entrance examinations of the École Normale Supérieure.\nHoüel entered the Collège Rollin in Paris on\n29\nOctober\n1841\n. He was taught mathematics by M Faurie who had been appointed in October\n1840\n. Faurie's reports show that Hoüel began his studies well and made excellent progress. Later, however, his progress seems to have been less good. Faurie reported\n[\n3\n]\n:-\nThis student is endowed with a fair and penetrating mind, but his memory is relatively less good. The work was generally less well done this semester than in the previous one: it mainly weakened in physics. However, his progress, without being what one could hope for, is still satisfactory, and we would be very much mistaken if he did not succeed in his future examination.\nHoüel sat the written examinations for entry to the École Normale Supérieure in August\n1843\nand on\n15\nOctober of that year he was given an oral examination. The first students ranked in the top six received free education at the École and the next six had to pay half the tuition fees. Hoüel, ranked eighth, was admitted with a half-fees scholarship.\nIn November\n1843\nhe began his studies at the École Normale Supérieure. His first year was successful and he was ranked third in the end of year examinations. He seems to have worked less well in his second year, being ranked ninth. Two of the twelve who entered with Hoüel had dropped out, so he was ninth from ten students. In his third year of study, Hoüel did teaching practice which was at the Collège Rollin in M Faurie's class. Faurie's report is very positive and says that Hoüel will make a good teacher.\nOne of Hoüel's fellow pupils was Gaston Lespiault who wrote in\n[\n12\n]\n:-\nIn October\n1843\n, Jules Houël entered the École Normale one of the first of his class. His education was as varied as it was extensive. It is assured that at the entrance examinations his composition in Latin was ranked first on the combined sections of science and literature. From the time of his stay at the school, his comrades were struck by the depth and originality of his ideas, his aspirations to the rigour, his distrust of anything vague. They also marvelled at his power of work, the art he already had and he always made sure never to lose a minute. It is to this period of his life that his first efforts go back to, his clear and rigorous theory of negative quantities, imaginary quantities and infinitely small ones. Today's young mathematicians hardly suspect what doubts and mistakes their elders were struggling with. If these obscurities have been dissipated, it is due to Houel more than to anyone.\nWhile a student at the École Normale Supérieure, he attended mathematics courses taught by\nJean Marie Constant Duhamel\n(\nanalysis and mechanics\n)\n,\nLouis Lefébure de Fourcy\n(\ndifferential and integral calculus\n)\nand\nJacques Charles François Sturm\n(\nmechanics\n)\n. Not all these courses were given at the École Normale Supérieure, for he also attended lectures at the Faculty of Science and at the École Polytechnique. As well as mathematics courses, he took courses on mineralogy, botany and zoology. Hoüel had always lacked confidence as a public speaker, something which had been first noted by his teacher Faurie when he was a student at the Collège Rollin. This led to him failing the aggregation in\n1846\nand he left the École Normale Supérieure without this qulification.\nAfter leaving the École Normale Supérieure, Hoüel was appointed as a mathematics teacher to the Collège de Bastia in Corsica in September\n1846\n. This, however, would have meant that he was far from Paris and could not have continued his education there and retake the aggregation examinations as he wished to do. He tried to obtain a transfer and, before ever taking up the job in Bastia, he was appointed to the Royal College of Bourges in October\n1846\n. On\n21\nAugust\n1847\nhe sat the aggregation examinations in Paris and he was successful.\nOn\n20\nSeptember\n1847\nhe was appointed to the Royal College of Bordeaux. He spent two difficult years there. The report on his teaching in the first year described him as \"zealous and very conscientious\" but not carrying enough weight with the students. A second report states that \"M Hoüel is undoubtedly an educated teacher, but he does not have the qualities needed to maintain discipline in a large class.\" The year\n1848\n-\n49\nwent very badly and the headmaster of the Royal College of Bordeaux asked for Hoüel to be transferred to a school where the classes were much smaller. On\n11\nSeptember\n1849\nHoüel wrote to the Minister of Education asking to move to, or near, Paris\n[\n3\n]\n:-\nDriven by a keen desire to increase my knowledge of mathematics, and to complete the work I have been doing for several years for the Ph.D., I would like to be in a position to take advantage of the courses of the Faculty of Sciences of Paris and the Collège de France, as well as the resources offered by libraries. If there were a vacancy among the supervising teaching posts at the École Normale, and if you wanted me take on these duties, I would accept them gratefully.\nThe Minister chose not to send Hoüel to a post in or near Paris but instead assigned him a position at the Lycée de Pau, a much lower quality school than the one he had taught in. He wrote an angry letter to the Minister\n[\n3\n]\n:-\n... instead of getting closer to my family, I am going to live in one of the most remote towns in Normandy; instead of obtaining a pecuniary improvement, I will not even find in Pau the resources offered me by Bordeaux.\nHoüel had also had a disappointment in his private life for during his last year in Bordeaux he had sought marriage to Antoinette Lucile Lecerf, the daughter of Daniel Henry Lecerf and Anne Jeanne Perrotte from Caen. Daniel Henry Lecerf refused to allow his daughter to marry Hoüel since he was not earning enough and lived too far from Caen.\nAt Pau, Hoüel received somewhat better reports for\n1849\n-\n50\nalthough his teaching was said to be too theoretical and he did not enthuse his pupils. The report for his second year,\n1850\n-\n51\nreads\n[\n3\n]\n:-\nHouel, who had completely failed as a teacher at the Lycée de Bordeaux, succeeded more than I had hoped. The class is good but not enough precision and warmth in his teaching methods. Results obtained are quite satisfactory.\nOn\n8\nMarch\n1851\nHoüel was appointed to the Lycée de Alençon. He wrote to Daniel Henry Lecerf saying that now he was nearer Caen, surely he could marry his daughter. The reports on his teaching at the Lycée de Alençon were similar to earlier ones, with his delivery\n[\n3\n]\n:-\n... a painful flow, always the same and everywhere monotonous, a slow and soft pronunciation, almost inarticulate.\nLucile Lecerf's father reluctantly consented to the marriage of his daughter to Hoüel. A marriage contract was signed on\n11\nSeptember\n1851\n, and the wedding took place on\n25\nSeptember\n1851\nin Caen. Jules and Lucile Hoüel began married life at\n25\nrue de Bretagne, Alençon.\nThe Minister of Education declared on\n22\nSeptember\n1852\nthat the higher mathematics classes at Alençon were to be closed and Hoüel was to be transferred to the Lycée de Poitiers to teach elementary mathematics. Hoüel, with support from several others, begged to be allowed to remain in Alençon. Finally, on\n21\nOctober\n1852\nthe Minister agreed that he could remain at Alençon teaching elementary mathematics. Jules and Lucile Hoüel's first child, Jeanne, was born on\n23\nFebruary\n1853\n. They had three further children, all girls, Louise\n(\nborn\n1857)\n, Marthe Julie Elizabeth\n(\nborn\n1858)\nand Henriette\n(\nborn\n1862)\n. Hoüel continued teaching at Alençon and, at the same time, worked on his doctoral thesis.\nOn\n18\nAugust\n1855\n, Hoüel submitted two theses to the Faculty of Science in Paris. The first was\nSur l'intégration des équations différentielles dans les problèmes de mécanique\nand the second thesis had the title\nApplication de la méthode de M Hamilton au calcul des perturbations de Jupiter\n. He was awarded the degree of Doctor of Mathematical Sciences. One month later he requested leave of absence from his teaching so he could obtain a position in higher education. He accepted, however, a teaching post at the Lycée in Caen but, like his other positions, it was reported that his teaching was unsatisfactory. He was unemployed from\n27\nMarch\n1856\n.\nUrbain Le Verrier\nwas impressed with Hoüel's research work and tried to persuade him to accept a post at the Observatory in Paris. Hoüel, however, decided not to accept the offer and spent the next four years undertaking research at his home in Thaon. Between\n1856\nand\n1859\nhe published about a dozen papers. Hoüel was appointed to the chair of pure mathematics in the Faculty of Science at Bordeaux in\n1859\nand held this post until his death. As Halsted points out in\n[\n11\n]\n:-\nHere he found dignity and facilities for work, and considered the position as final.\nHoüel published,\nEssai d'une exposition rationnelle des principes fondamentaux de la Géométrie élémentaire\n, a work on geometry, in\n1863\n. At this stage he did not know of the published work on non-euclidean geometry but he clearly was working his way towards the idea. He wrote:-\nSince long, the scientific researches of mathematicians on the fundamental principles of elementary geometry have concentrated themselves almost exclusively on the theory of parallels, and if, hitherto, the efforts of so many eminent minds have produced no satisfactory result, it is perhaps permitted to conclude thence that in pursuing these researches they have followed a false path and attacked an insoluble problem, of which the importance has been exaggerated in consequence of inexact ideas on the nature and origin of the primordial truths of the science of space.\nHoüel became interested in non-euclidean geometry once he had been made aware of the work of\nJános Bolyai\nand\nNikolai Lobachevsky\n. He published translations of many important works by\nBolyai\n,\nBeltrami\n,\nHelmholtz\nand\nRiemann\n. He corresponded with\nJoseph de Tilly\non non-euclidean geometry. In\n[\n11\n]\nGeorge Halsted\nexplains how Hoüel obtained\nBolyai\n's work:-\n... Hoüel's 'Essai' of\n1863\nhaving come by chance into the hands of a young architect of Temesvár in Hungary, this youth Franz Schmidt, desirous of continuing his mathematical studies wrote for counsel to Hoüel. Hoüel had answered helpfully, and later implored the aid of Schmidt to procure\nBolyai\n's work ... Schmidt succeeded in procuring for Hoüel two copies of\nBolyai\n's work. One Hoüel proceeded to translate himself, the other he sent to\nBattaglini\n, asking him to make known in Italy this wonderful idea.\nAt Hoüel's suggestion Schmidt collected material which enabled him to write the first biography of\nBolyai\nwhich he did in\n1868\n.\nAmong his other researches, Hoüel compiled log tables\nTable de logarithmes à cinq décimales pour les nombres et pour les lignes trigonométriques, suivies des logarithmes d'addition et de soustraction et de diverses tables usuelles\nⓉ\n(\nFive-decimal logarithm table for numbers and trigonometric lines, followed by addition and subtraction logarithms and various usual tables\n)\n(1858)\n.\nFor a list of Hoüel's publications\n(\nincluding his many translations\n)\n, see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nOne important feature of Hoüel's work was his extensive correspondence with other mathematicians. Much of this is now published, for example Victor Pambuccian reviewing\n[\n2\n]\nwrites:-\nThis is a very interesting historical document on the state of mind prevailing between\n1870\nand\n1885\non two questions, that of the existence of continuous nowhere differentiable functions and that of non-Euclidean geometry. Following a detailed,\n80\n-page-long presentation of the terms of the debate in their historical context, the book consists of\n191\nletters between Jules Hoüel and\nJoseph Marie de Tilly\n,\n66\nletters between Hoüel and\nDarboux\n, and\n11\nletters between Hoüel and Victor-Amédée Le Besgue, written between\n1867\nand\n1868\n, as well as a few letters between Hoüel and\nCatalan\n, Kowalski, and\nBeltrami\n.\nRiemann\n,\nLobachevsky\n,\nBolyai\n,\nWeierstrass\n,\nGauss\n,\nLegendre\n, Flye Sainte-Marie, and several others figure prominently in the correspondence.\nHis obituary written by\nGaston Darboux\nshows that Hoüel had a brilliant career as a professor, producing outstanding research papers and making a remarkable contribution to mathematics through his extensive correspondence. His brilliant academic career makes an interesting contrast to the first half of his life as a \"failed school teacher.\"",
