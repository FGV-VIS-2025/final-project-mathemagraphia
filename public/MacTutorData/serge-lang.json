  "biografia": "Serge Lang\nwas born in Saint-Germain-en-Laye close to Paris. His father Étienne Lang was a businessman and his mother Helene Schlepianoff was a concert pianist. Serge had a twin brother who became a basketball coach and a sister who became an actress. Serge lived in Paris and attended school there until the beginning of World War II when he was in the\n10\nth\ngrade. The war began in September\n1939\nbut it was not until June\n1940\nthat German troops entered Paris. Serge together with his father and sister fled to the United States where they settled in Los Angeles, California. It was there that Lang completed his high school education and then entered the California Institute of Technology.\nLang graduated from the California Institute of Technology in\n1946\nwith a B.A. in physics. He then served for around eighteen months in the U.S. Army and he was stationed for part of this time in Italy and Germany. After returning to the United States, Lang went to Princeton University with the intention of studying for a doctorate in philosophy. After a year in the philosophy department, he changed to mathematics and\nEmil Artin\nbecame his thesis advisor. He was awarded his Ph.D. in\n1951\nfor his dissertation\nOn Quasi Algebraic Closure\n. His early publications were in the area of his thesis, for example in\n1952\nhe published three papers:\nOn quasi algebraic closure; Hilbert's Nullstellensatz in infinite-dimensional space\n; and\n(\nwith\nJohn Tate\n)\nOn Chevalley's proof of Lüroth's theorem\n. Perhaps the most significant of his early papers is\nNumber of points of varieties in finite fields\n(1954)\nwritten in collaboration with\nAndré Weil\n.\nLang was an instructor at Princeton during\n1951\n-\n53\nwhen he was also a visitor at the Institute for Advanced Study. During\n1953\n-\n55\nhe was an instructor at the University of Chicago, then he became a professor at Columbia University in\n1955\n. We will discuss some of his passions below, both mathematical and non-mathematical, but let us say at this stage that he was deeply interested in politics and very strongly opposed to the Vietnam War. In\n1971\nhe resigned his position at Columbia University in protest at their treatment of anti-war protestors. At the time he resigned he had no idea where he might find another position. In fact he was offered a position at Yale University in\n1972\nand he remained there for the rest of his career until he retired in the spring of\n2005\n. On his retirement the president of Yale gave a speech in his honour\n(\nsee for example\n[\n5\n]\n)\n:-\nYour primary love has always been number theory and you have written, by one colleague's estimate, over\n50\nbooks and monographs\n[\nactually over\n60]\n, many of them concerned with this topic. Several of your monographs are the only, or nearly the only, book treatments of their important subjects. Your famous theorem in\nDiophantine equations\nearned you the distinguished\nCole\nPrize of the\nAmerican Mathematical Society\n. Your textbooks also have garnered accolades. Your 'Calculus for undergraduates' went through many editions in the seventies and eighties, and your 'Algebra' textbook is a standard reference in the field. So prodigious are you as a scholar that there are actual jokes in your profession about you. One joke goes: \"Someone calls the Yale Mathematics Department, and asks for Serge Lang. The assistant who answers says, 'He can't talk now, he is writing a book. I will put you on hold.'\"\nIn your character, you are uncompromising in your insistence on what you perceive as logical consistency and rhetorical honesty, and you have questioned much received wisdom and many authorities in the external world as well as here at Yale. You are an excellent and deeply caring teacher, and in honour of this several years ago you received the Dylon Hixon Prize for teaching in Yale College. Your students keep in touch with you years after they graduate and one has created an endowed fund in your honour. Among your many monographs there is one called 'The Beauty of Doing Mathematics', a collection of three dialogues you gave in Paris in the '\n80\ns. Yale is grateful to you for the passion with which you understand, practice and profess the mathematical arts, and wishes you well as you continue your lifelong engagement with their illimitable splendours.\nLang's mathematical research ranged over a wide range of topics such as algebraic geometry, Diophantine geometry\n(\na term Lang invented\n)\n, transcendental number theory, Diophantine approximation,\nanalytic number theory\nand its connections to representation theory, modular curves and their applications in number theory,\nL\nL\nL\n-series, hyperbolic geometry, Arakelov theory, and\ndifferential geometry\n. His books, although many are on the topics that he was undertaking research in, cover an even wider range of mathematics. Many are based on graduate courses that he was giving. He always said that the best way to learn a topic was to write a book on it. To single out some highlights from such a range of books is almost impossible. However most would agree that\nAlgebra\n(1965)\nwas the most influential of his graduate level texts\n[\n5\n]\n:-\nLang single-handedly reorganises and revitalises this fundamental and central subject. The book has had an enormous impact.\nYou can read the Foreword to this book at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nA second expanded edition appeared in\n1984\nand a third edition in\n2002\n. Lang wrote in the Foreword to the\n2002\nbook:-\nFrom now on, Algebra appears with Springer-Verlag, like the rest of my books. With this change, I considered the possibility of a new edition, but decided against it. I view the book as very stable. The only addition which I would make, if starting from scratch, would be some of the algebraic properties of SL\n(\nn\n)\nand GL\n(\nn\n)\n(\nover\nR\n\\mathbb{R}\nR\nor\nC\n\\mathbb{C}\nC\n)\n, beyond the proof of simplicity in Chapter XIII. As things stood, I just inserted some exercises concerning some aspects which everybody should know.\nPerhaps Lang's most used undergraduate text is\nA first course in calculus\nwhich he first published in\n1964\n.\nYou can read the Foreword to the text at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nOther books by Lang include\nIntroduction to algebraic geometry\n(1958)\n,\nAbelian varieties\n(1959)\n,\nDiophantine geometry\n(1962)\n,\nIntroduction to differentiable manifolds\n(1962)\n,\nAlgebraic numbers\n(1964)\n,\nLinear algebra\n(1966)\n,\nIntroduction to diophantine approximations\n(1966)\n,\nIntroduction to transcendental numbers\n(1966)\n,\nAlgebraic structures\n(1967)\n,\nAlgebraic number theory\n(1970)\n,\nIntroduction to algebraic and abelian functions\n(1972)\n,\nDifferential manifolds\n(1972)\n,\nElliptic functions\n(1973)\n, SL\n(\nR\n)\n(1975)\n,\nIntroduction to modular forms\n(1976)\n,\nComplex analysis\n(1977)\n,\nCyclotomic fields\n(1978)\n,\nElliptic curves: Diophantine analysis\n(1978)\n,\nUndergraduate analysis\n(1983)\n,\nComplex multiplication\n(1983)\n,\nRiemann-Roch algebra\n(1985)\n,\nThe beauty of doing mathematics. Three public dialogues\n(1985)\n,\nIntroduction to complex hyperbolic spaces\n(1987)\n,\nIntroduction to Arakelov theory\n(1988)\n,\nTopics in Nevanlinna theory\n(1990)\n,\nBasic analysis of regularized series and products\n(1993)\n,\nFundamentals of differential geometry\n(1999)\n, and\nMath talks for undergraduates\n(1999)\n.\nLet us now look at Lang's long campaign against injustices and inaccuracies. He had felt strongly about such matter all his life as his resignation from Columbia University in\n1971\nshows. However it was around\n1977\nthat he began to fight causes in a more aggressive way. Let us give two examples of causes that Lang fought. First we mention the case of the Harvard political scientist Samuel P Huntington. In the book\nPolitical order in changing societies\nthat Huntington published in\n1968\nhe used pseudo-mathematical arguments to prove that in the\n1960\ns South Africa was a \"satisfied society\". Lang did not believe the conclusion so he looked how Huntington justified this claim and saw that he used methodology which was simply not valid. Lang suspected that he was using false pseudo-mathematical argument to give arguments that he wanted to justify greater authority. It was, said Lang:-\n... a type of language which gives the illusion of science without any of its substance.\nLang fought a vigorous campaign to prevent Huntington becoming a member of the\nNational Academy of Sciences\nin\n1986\nafter he had been nominated. Lang was successful on this occasion and also on a second occasion when Huntington was again nominated. A detailed description of these events was published by Lang in\nAcademia, Journalism, and Politics: A Case Study: The Huntington Case\nwhich occupies the first\n222\npages of his\n1998\nbook\nChallenges\n.\nThe second case we look at as an example of Lang's campaigns is his attempt to discredit the results of\nThe\n1977\nsurvey of the American professoriate\npublished in\n1979\nby Everett C Ladd and Seymour M Lipsett. In\n1981\nLang published\nThe File: Case Study in Correction\n(1977\n-\n1979)\nwhich consists of copies of correspondence concerning the survey. Lang always liked the facts to speak for themselves so he made relatively little commentary on the documents. He does, however, set out clearly why he fought that campaign and the many others that he fought with equal vigour:-\nI don't like the nonsense that passes for rational discourse so often in our society. I am very much bothered by the inaccuracies, ambiguities, code words, slogans, catch phrases, public relation devices, sweeping generalizations, and stereotypes, which are used\n(\nconsciously or otherwise\n)\nto influence people.\nI am bothered by the inability of many to recognize these for what they are. I am bothered by the way people fudge issues, or are unable to clarify them, sometimes because they are inhibited by \"collegiality\" and other forms of intimidation\n(\nsometimes subtle, sometimes not\n)\n. Most people put up with the nonsense without doing anything about it\n(\nunable or unwilling, for whatever reason - inertia, lack, of energy, lack of interest, lack of time, etc.\n)\n, often falling into cynicism and despair.\nI am bothered by the misinformation which gets disseminated uncritically through the media and by the obstructions which prevent correct information from being disseminated. These obstructions come about in many ways - personal, institutional, through self-imposed inhibitions, through external inhibitions, through outright dishonesty, through incompetence - the list is a long one.\nI am bothered by the way misinformation, disguised as scholarship, is used in social, political, and educational contexts to affect policy decisions.\nI am bothered by the way misinformation is accepted uncritically, and by the way people are unable to recognize it or reject it.\nLang received many honours for his achievements. For example he was awarded the\nFrank Nelson Cole\nPrize in\n1959\nfrom the\nAmerican Mathematical Society\n, the Prix Carrière in France in\n1967\n, the Humboldt Award for research and teaching in\n1984\n, and the Leroy P Steele Prize for mathematical exposition from the\nAmerican Mathematical Society\nin\n1999\n, and the Dylan Hixon '\n88\nPrize for Teaching in the Sciences in\n2004\n. He was elected a member of the\nNational Academy of Sciences\nin\n1985\n. It is worth noting that although he accepted the Leroy P Steele Prize in\n1999\n, he had in fact resigned from the\nAmerican Mathematical Society\nin\n1996\nin a dispute about an article in the\nNotices\n. He made it very plain in his acceptance speech for the prize that he did not wish his acceptance in any way to lessen the arguments he had with the Society.",
