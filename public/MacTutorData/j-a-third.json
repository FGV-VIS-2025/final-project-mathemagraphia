  "biografia": "J A Third\n's father was  John D Third\n(\nborn  in Aberdeen in\n1837)\nwho was a stonemason. His mother was  Ann Sinclair\n(\nborn in Tyrie, Aberdeenshire about\n1840)\n. He was the oldest of his parents' children having younger siblings: James, Alexander, Henry Third, Helen and Andrew.\nJ A Third was educated at Robert Gordon's College and he graduated with Honours in Philosophy and Mathematics from the University of Aberdeen in\n1885\n. In his student days he was one of the editors of\nAlma Mater\n, the Aberdeen University student magazine.\nHe was then appointed as an assistant in mathematics at Aberdeen University and later he became a lecturer at Aberdeen Training College. After studying at Jena, Germany, he took a D.Sc. at Aberdeen in\n1889\n. Before that, in\n1890\n, he had been appointed as Rector of Campbeltown Grammar School, Argyllshire, then five years later as Headmaster of Spier's School, Beith, Ayrshire where he taught English in addition to his administrative duties. S C 'Simmie' Jamieson of Beith was born on\n18\nSeptember\n1905\n. In an interview on\n5\nJanuary\n1994\nhe spoke about Spier's School at the time that Third was headmaster:-\nI was fortunate to win a bursary to go to Spier's School. The teachers all wore mortar boards and gowns. There was an air of authority and tradition about the place. In my day the school took in boarders as well as the majority of day pupils from the Garnock Valley. The school became very well known and respected because of the academic success of the pupils. It was a highly regarded school in Scotland. Morning prayers were held first thing every morning and you had to be there for them. The teachers were, I believe, far greater disciplinarians than you find in the schools now. Everything seemed to be much tighter and firmer and under very much more control than now. ... The headmaster at Spiers was Doctor Third. He was a well-known academic. He knew how to handle a school very well indeed. He was there throughout my time.\nThird joined the\nEdinburgh Mathematical Society\nin January\n1897\n. He was an enthusiastic member publishing papers in the\nProceedings\nsuch as the\n30\npage paper\nSystems of circles analogous to Tucker circles\n(1898)\n. He read papers to the Society such as\nSystems of Spheres connected with the Tetrahedron\nto the meeting on\n9\nJune\n1899\n,\nTriangles Triply in Perspective\nto the meeting on\n14\nDecember\n1900\n, and\nGeneralisation of the 'Orthopole' and Allied Theorems\non\n14\nMarch\n1914\n. He served as president of the Society\n1902\n-\n03\n. Third also published papers and posed questions in other publications. For example he posed a beautiful, and rather surprising, question in the\nMathematical Gazette\nin\n1900\n:-\nThrough a given point in the plane of a triangle to draw three lines terminated by the sides of the triangle, two and two, such that their extremities shall lie on a circle.\nAt the annual meeting of the\nBritish Mathematical Association\n, held on\n20\nJanuary\n1900\n, Third presented the paper\nTriangles triply in perspective\n. In the Mathematical Questions and Solutions section of the\nEducational Times\nof\n1902\nhe published\nThe perpendicular from the isogonal conjugate of any point on the Euler line of a triangle to the trilinear polar of the point passes through the orthocentre\n.\nThe\nEdinburgh Mathematical Society\nwas not the only British mathematical society that Third joined for, on\n9\nMay\n1901\n, he paid the life-composition fee of the\nLondon Mathematical Society\nand became a member for life.\nThird married Elizabeth Lamb Ramage. They had a son, John Third, who was awarded an Honours M.A. from Aberdeen in\n1914\n, then later worked for ICI. They also had a daughter Edith Ramage Stewart Third who married Alexander Turnbull, a carpet manufacturer, in Glasgow Cathedral on\n15\nSeptember\n1926\n.\nThird was Chairman of the Educational Institute branch in Kintyre and Ayrshire and in this capacity served on many committees. In\n1919\nhe was President-elect of the Educational Institute but resigned the position on being appointed Director of Education. He was Director of Education for Ayrshire from\n1919\nuntil he retired in\n1927\n. After retiring, Third moved to Edinburgh where he spent the final\n20\nyears of his life. After his death the Dr J A Third prize was set up in the University of Aberdeen. It is awarded annually to the best student of mathematics.",
