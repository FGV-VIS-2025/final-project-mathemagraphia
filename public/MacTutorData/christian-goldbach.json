  "biografia": "Christian Goldbach\n's father was a Protestant Church minister in Königsberg. Goldbach was brought up in Königsberg and attended the university there. He seems to have studied some mathematics, but he mainly studied law and medicine. In\n1710\nhe set off on a lengthy journey around Europe, meeting many of the leading scientists on his travels. In Leipzig in\n1711\nhe met\nLeibniz\nand after Goldbach moved on the two carried on a correspondence. Five letters from\nLeibniz\nto Goldbach and six letters from Goldbach to\nLeibniz\n, all written in the years\n1711\nto\n1713\n, are discussed in\n[\n13\n]\n. Both correspondents wrote in Latin.\nIn\n1712\nNicolaus\n(\nI\n)\nBernoulli\nwas also on European travels and he was visiting England. Goldbach met him and also\nde Moivre\nin London, and he met\nNicolaus\n(\nI\n)\nBernoulli\nagain in Oxford. Goldbach was fascinated by mathematics but he did not have much knowledge of the subject. When\nBernoulli\nstarted to discuss infinite series with Goldbach as they talked in Oxford, Goldbach confessed that he knew nothing about the topic.\nBernoulli\ngave him a loan of a book on the topic by his uncle\nJacob Bernoulli\nbut Goldbach found infinite series too difficult at that time, and gave up his attempts to understand\nJacob Bernoulli\n's text.\nGoldbach continued his lengthy tour and was in Venice in\n1721\n. Here he met\nNicolaus\n(\nII\n)\nBernoulli\nwho was also on a tour of European countries. It was at\nNicolaus\n(\nII\n)\nBernoulli\n's suggestion that Goldbach began a correspondence with his younger brother\nDaniel Bernoulli\nin\n1723\n. The two continued this correspondence for seven years. By\n1724\nGoldbach was back in his home town of Königsberg and there he met two people who would change his life, namely Georg Bernhard Bilfinger and\nJakob Hermann\n. Bilfinger was a German philosopher, mathematician, and statesman, who had been professor of moral philosophy and mathematics at Tübingen but had just been sacked over a charge of atheism. The charge arose through his association with the philosopher Christian Wolff, who had then helped arrange that Bilfinger should be involved in setting up the Imperial Academy of Sciences\n(\nlater called the\nSt Petersburg Academy of Sciences\n)\nwhich was to be organised\n(\nat\nLeibniz\n's suggestion\n)\nalong the lines of the\nBerlin Academy of Sciences\n. He was on his way to St Petersburg when he met Goldbach, and\nJakob Hermann\nwas also on his way to take part of this new exciting venture.\nWhen he was in Riga in July\n1725\n, Goldbach wrote to L L Blumentrost, the President elect of the proposed new Academy, asking for a position there. After an initial rejection, Goldbach was offered the positions of professor of mathematics and historian at St Petersburg. One may wonder how Goldbach was offered such an important position. In fact his record as a mathematician was by this time rather better than the picture we painted above. We mentioned that Goldbach gave up his attempts to understand infinite series in\n1712\n. However in\n1717\nhe read an article by\nLeibniz\non computing the area of a circle and this led him to look again at the theory of infinite series. Goldbach published\nSpecimen methodi ad summas serierum\nⓉ\n(\nExamples of methods of summing series\n)\nin\nActa eruditorum\nin\n1720\n. In\n1724\nhe published another paper and earlier he had a couple of other works published. He was, therefore, an established mathematician although it has to be said that his papers do not add a great deal to mathematical knowledge.\nGoldbach was recording secretary for the opening ceremony of the Academy which was held on\n27\nDecember\n1725\n, and continued to act in this role until January\n1728\n. To understand how Goldbach's life progressed in Russia we need to look briefly at the political events which were taking place there. Peter I the Great ruled Russia from\n1682\nto\n1725\n. He and his wife Catherine were the driving force behind setting up the Academy and it was set up in St Petersburg because that was the Russian capital at this time. After Peter the Great died, his wife Catherine ruled from St Petersburg from\n1725\nto\n1727\n. Aleksandr Danilovich Menshikov had been an advisor to Peter the Great but had fallen out of favour towards the end of his reign. However, he was close to Catherine and succeeded in having her named empress in\n1725\n. Menshikov was then the effective ruler and on Catherine's death in\n1727\nhe continued to be the ruler becoming regent to Peter II, who was eleven years old when he came to the throne. This lasted only a few months before Peter II turned against Menshikov, and asked the Dolgoruky family to assist him. Menshikov was arrested in September\n1727\n, and sent to Siberia. The Dolgoruky family arranged for a new tutor for the young Peter II to take over from the one appointed by Menshikov. Goldbach was appointed to the position and he moved to Moscow when Peter moved the court there in January\n1728\n.\nEuler\nhad arrived in St Petersburg on\n17\nMay\n1727\nand after Goldbach moved to Moscow he began a correspondence with\nEuler\nin\n1729\n. This important correspondence, which continued for around\n35\nyears, is discussed below.\nPeter II died of smallpox in January\n1730\nand Anna Ivanovna became empress of Russia. Goldbach was no longer required as a tutor, but he continued to serve Anna. In\n1732\nAnna moved the court back to St Petersburg and Goldbach returned there and again became active in the Academy as well as being heavily involved with the Russian government. He was appointed as corresponding secretary to the Academy in\n1732\nand then in\n1737\nhe became one of two people responsible for the administration of the Academy\n(\nthe other was J D Schuhmacher\n)\n. Goldbach's problem, however, was that as well as being heavily involved with the administration of the Academy, he was also rising to more responsible roles in the government of Russia. Anna Ivanovna died in\n1740\n, having named Ivan, the son of her niece Anna Leopoldovna, as her successor with his mother as regent. Ivan was only a few weeks old when he became emperor, but in the following year, Elizabeth, the daughter of Emperor Peter I the Great, was able to remove Ivan and his mother and she then ruled Russia for the next\n20\nyears. It is worth noting that the various political moves which replaced one Russian ruler by another always were accompanied by a purge of officials. Goldbach, however, seemed able to continue to hold positions of high influence despite the changes at the top. Goldbach had\n[\n1\n]\n:-\n... a superb command of Latin style and equal fluency in German and French. Goldbach's polished manners and cosmopolitan circle of friends and acquaintances assured his success in an elite society struggling to emulate its western neighbours.\nIn\n1740\nGoldbach requested that his duties at the Academy be reduced, and when he was appointed to a senior position in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, he ceased all his work for the Academy. He continued to raise in status with large increases in salary and he received lands. In\n1760\nhe became a privy councillor, and was asked to lay down guidance for the education of royal children. The guidelines Goldbach drew up became the accepted practice for the next\n100\nyears.\nGoldbach did important work in\nnumber theory\n, much of it in correspondence with\nEuler\n. He is best remembered for his conjecture, made in\n1742\nin a letter to\nEuler\n(\nand still an open question\n)\n, that every even integer greater than\n2\ncan be represented as the sum of two\nprimes\n. It has been checked by computer for numbers up to at least\n4\n×\n1\n0\n14\n4 \\times  10^{14}\n4\n×\n1\n0\n1\n4\n. Goldbach also conjectured that every odd number is the sum of three primes.\nVinogradov\nmade progress on this second conjecture in\n1937\n. Also in the Euler-Goldbach correspondence, described in\n[\n3\n]\n(\nsee also\n[\n6\n]\n,\n[\n7\n]\n,\n[\n8\n]\n,\n[\n11\n]\n,\n[\n14\n]\n)\nthey discuss\nFermat\nnumbers,\nMersenne\nnumbers, perfect numbers, the representation of natural numbers as a sum of four squares,\nWaring\n's problem\n(\nwhich\nEuler\nsolved before\nWaring\n)\n, polynomials representing numerous primes,\nFermat\n's Last Theorem, and the representation of any odd numbers in the form\n2\nn\n2\n+\np\n2n^{2} + p\n2\nn\n2\n+\np\nwhere\np\np\np\nis prime.\nThe last conjecture was made by Goldbach in a letter written to\nEuler\non\n18\nNovember\n1752\n.\nEuler\nreplied on\n16\nDecember, saying he had checked\nGoldbach's conjecture\nup to\n1000\n. In a letter of\n3\nApril\n1753\n,\nEuler\nreported to Goldbach that he had checked it up to\n2500\n. In fact the conjecture is false. In\n1856\nMoritz A Stern, a professor of mathematics at Göttingen, found two numbers which could not be written as twice a square plus a prime, namely\n5777\nand\n5993\n. No other examples of numbers failing to satisfy this conjecture of Goldbach seem to be known. It is interesting to ponder that Goldbach could, with some hard work, have tested this conjecture to\n2500\nas\nEuler\ndid. However he did seemed to treat mathematics as a recreation, rather than a one where hard effort should be employed. Again, however, we should note his remarkable mathematical intuition\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nThe correspondence with\nEuler\nas a whole marks Goldbach as one of the few men of his day who understood the implications of\nFermat\n's new approach to the subject.\nAlthough Goldbach published a number of works other than the ones we have mentioned above, it is the insight which he showed in his letters which have proved by far his most important mathematical contribution. We should, however, mention his another two of his papers on infinite series\nDe transformatione serierum\nⓉ\n(\nOn transformation of series\n)\n(1729)\nand\nDe terminis generalibus serierum\nⓉ\n(\nOn general terms of series\n)\n(1732)\n. The first of these introduced a method of transforming one series into another while the sum of the series remains fixed. The second extends the work begun in his\n1720\npaper mentioned above. He also studied equations and worked out in his correspondence with\nEuler\nhow to provide a quick test for whether an algebraic equation has a\nrational\nroot.",
