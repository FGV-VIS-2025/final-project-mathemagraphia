  "biografia": "Kiyosi Ito\nstudied mathematics in the Faculty of Science of the Imperial University of Tokyo. It was during his student years that he became attracted to\nprobability theory\n. In\n[\n3\n]\nhe explains how this came about:-\nEver since I was a student, I have been attracted to the fact that statistical laws reside in seemingly random phenomena. Although I knew that probability theory was a means of describing such phenomena, I was not satisfied with contemporary papers or works on probability theory, since they did not clearly define the random variable, the basic element of probability theory. At that time, few mathematicians regarded probability theory as an authentic mathematical field, in the same strict sense that they regarded differential and integral calculus. With clear definition of real numbers formulated at the end of the\n19\nth\ncentury, differential and integral calculus had developed into an authentic mathematical system. When I was a student, there were few researchers in probability; among the few were\nKolmogorov\nof Russia, and\nPaul Levy\nof France.\nIn\n1938\nIto graduated from the University of Tokyo and in the following year he was appointed to the Cabinet Statistics Bureau. He worked there until\n1943\nand it was during this period that he made his most outstanding contributions:-\nDuring those five years I had much free time, thanks to the special consideration given me by the then Director Kawashima ... Accordingly, I was able to continue studying probability theory, by reading\nKolmogorov\n's Basic Concept of Probability Theory and\nLevy\n's Theory of Sum of Independent Random Variables. At that time, it was commonly believed that\nLevy\n's works were extremely difficult, since\nLevy\n, a pioneer in the new mathematical field, explained probability theory based on his intuition. I attempted to describe\nLevy\n's ideas, using precise logic that\nKolmogorov\nmight use. Introducing the concept of regularisation, developed by\nDoob\nof the United States, I finally devised stochastic differential equations, after painstaking solitary endeavours. My first paper was thus developed; today, it is common practice for mathematicians to use my method to describe\nLevy\n's theory.\nIn\n1940\nhe published\nOn the probability distribution on a compact group\non which he collaborated with Yukiyosi Kawada. The background to Ito's famous\n1942\npaper\nOn stochastic processes\n(\nInfinitely divisible laws of probability\n)\nwhich he published in the\nJapanese Journal of Mathematics\nis given in\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nBrown, a botanist, discovered the motion of pollen particles in water. At the beginning of the twentieth century,\nBrownian motion\nwas studied by\nEinstein\n, Perrin and other physicists. In\n1923\n, against this scientific background,\nWiener\ndefined probability measures in path spaces, and used the concept of\nLebesgue\nintegrals to lay the mathematical foundations of stochastic analysis. In\n1942\n, Dr. Ito began to reconstruct from scratch the concept of stochastic integrals, and its associated theory of analysis. He created the theory of stochastic differential equations, which describe motion due to random events.\nAlthough today we see this paper as a fundamental one, it was not seen as such by mathematicians at the time it was published. Ito, who still did not have a doctorate at this time, would have to wait several years before the importance of his ideas would be fully appreciated and mathematicians would begin to contribute to developing the theory. In\n1943\nIto was appointed as Assistant Professor in the Faculty of Science of Nagoya Imperial University. This was a period of high activity for Ito, and when one considers that this occurred during the years of extreme difficulty in Japan caused by World War II, one has to find this all the more remarkable. Volume\n20\nof the\nProceedings of the Imperial Academy of Tokyo\ncontains six papers by Ito:\n(1)\nOn the ergodicity of a certain stationary process\n;\n(2)\nA kinematic theory of turbulence\n;\n(3)\nOn the normal stationary process with no hysteresis\n;\n(4)\nA screw line in Hilbert space and its application to the probability theory\n;\n(5)\nStochastic integral\n; and\n(6)\nOn Student's test\n.\nIn\n1945\nIto was awarded his doctorate. He continued to develop his ideas on stochastic analysis with many important papers on the topic. Among them were\nOn a stochastic integral equation\n(1946)\n,\nOn the stochastic integral\n(1948)\n,\nStochastic differential equations in a differentiable manifold\n(1950)\n,\nBrownian motions in a Lie group\n(1950)\n, and\nOn stochastic differential equations\n(1951)\n.\nIn\n1952\nIto was appointed to a Professorship at Kyoto University. In the following year he published his famous text\nProbability theory\n. In this book, Ito develops the theory on a probability space using terms and tools from measure theory. The years\n1954\n-\n56\nIto spent at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton University. An important publication by Ito in\n1957\nwas\nStochastic processes\n. This book contained five chapters, the first providing an introduction, then the remaining ones studying processes with independent increments, stationary processes,\nMarkov\nprocesses, and the theory of diffusion processes. In\n1960\nIto visited the Tata Institute in Bombay, India, where he gave a series of lectures surveying his own work and that of other on\nMarkov\nprocesses, Levy processes, Brownian motion and linear diffusion.\nAlthough Ito remained as a professor at Kyoto University until he retired in\n1979\n, he also held positions as professor at Aarhus University from\n1966\nto\n1969\nand professor at Cornell University from\n1969\nto\n1975\n. During his last three years at Kyoto before he retired, Ito was Director of the Research Institute for Mathematical Sciences there. After retiring from Kyoto University in\n1979\nhe did not retire from mathematics but continued to write research papers. He was also appointed at Professor at Gakushuin University.\nIto gives a wonderful description mathematical beauty in\n[\n3\n]\nwhich he then relates to the way in which he and other mathematicians have developed his fundamental ideas:-\nIn precisely built mathematical structures, mathematicians find the same sort of beauty others find in enchanting pieces of music, or in magnificent architecture. There is, however, one great difference between the beauty of mathematical structures and that of great art. Music by Mozart, for instance, impresses greatly even those who do not know musical theory; the cathedral in Cologne overwhelms spectators even if they know nothing about Christianity. The beauty in mathematical structures, however, cannot be appreciated without understanding of a group of numerical formulae that express laws of logic. Only mathematicians can read \"musical scores\" containing many numerical formulae, and play that \"music\" in their hearts. Accordingly, I once believed that without numerical formulae, I could never communicate the sweet melody played in my heart. Stochastic differential equations, called \"Ito Formula,\" are currently in wide use for describing phenomena of random fluctuations over time. When I first set forth stochastic differential equations, however, my paper did not attract attention. It was over ten years after my paper that other mathematicians began reading my \"musical scores\" and playing my \"music\" with their \"instruments.\" By developing my \"original musical scores\" into more elaborate \"music,\" these researchers have contributed greatly to developing \"Ito Formula.\"\nIto received many honours for his outstanding mathematical contributions. He was awarded the Asahi Prize in\n1978\n, and in the same year he received the Imperial Prize and also the\nJapan Academy\nPrize. In\n1985\nhe received the Fujiwara Prize and in\n1998\nthe Kyoto Prize in Basic Sciences from the Inamori Foundation. These prizes were all from Japan, and a further Japanese honour was his election to the\nJapan Academy\n. However, he also received many honours from other countries. He was elected to the National Academy of Science of the United States and to the\nAcadémie des Sciences\nof France. He received the Wolf Prize from Israel and honorary doctorates from the universities of Warwick, England and ETH, Zürich, Switzerland. He won the\nIMU\nGauss\nprize in\n2006\n.\nIn\n[\n2\n]\nthis tribute is paid to Ito:-\nNowadays, Dr. Ito's theory is used in various fields, in addition to mathematics, for analysing phenomena due to random events. Calculation using the \"Ito calculus\" is common not only to scientists in physics, population genetics, stochastic control theory, and other natural sciences, but also to mathematical finance in economics. In fact, experts in financial affairs refer to Ito calculus as \"Ito's formula.\" Dr. Ito is the father of the modern stochastic analysis that has been systematically developing during the twentieth century. This ceaseless development has been led by many, including Dr. Ito, whose work in this regard is remarkable for its mathematical depth and strong interaction with a wide range of areas. His work deserves special mention as involving one of the basic theories prominent in mathematical sciences during this century.\nA recent monograph entitled\nIto's Stochastic Calculus and Probability Theory\n(1996)\n, dedicated to Ito on the occasion of his eightieth birthday, contains papers which deal with recent developments of Ito's ideas:-\nProfessor Kiyosi Ito is well known as the creator of the modern theory of stochastic analysis. Although Ito first proposed his theory, now known as Ito's stochastic analysis or Ito's stochastic calculus, about fifty years ago, its value in both pure and applied mathematics is becoming greater and greater. For almost all modern theories at the forefront of probability and related fields, Ito's analysis is indispensable as an essential instrument, and it will remain so in the future. For example, a basic formula, called the Ito formula, is well known and widely used in fields as diverse as physics and economics.",
