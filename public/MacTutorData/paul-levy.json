  "biografia": "Paul Lévy\nwas born into a family containing several mathematicians. He was the son of Lucien Lévy\n(1853\n-\n1912)\nand Alice Flora Wolff\n(1856\n-\n1921)\n. Lucien and Alice were married on\n3\nJune\n1878\n. Lucien Lévy had studied at the École Polytechnique from\n1872\nto\n1877\nand then had a career as a professor of mathematics, first at the lycée of Rennes and then in Paris, at the lycée Louis le Grand. As well as teaching in lycées, during most of his career he was an examiner at the École Polytechnique. He wrote several books:\nArithmétique à l'usage de l'enseignement secondaire spécial\nⓉ\n(\nArithmetic for use in special secondary education\n)\n(1880)\n,\nÉléments d'arithmétique\nⓉ\n(\nElements of arithmetic\n)\n(1883)\n,\nPrécis élémentaire de la théorie des fonctions elliptiques avec tables numériques et applications\nⓉ\n(\nElementary precision of the theory of elliptic functions with numerical tables and applications\n)\n(1898)\n,\n(\nwith\nEugène Rouché\n)\nAnalyse infinitésimale à l'usage des ingénieurs\nVol\n1\nⓉ\n(\nInfinitesimal Analysis for Engineers Vol\n1\n)\n(1900)\n,\n(\nwith\nEugène Rouché\n)\nAnalyse infinitésimale à l'usage des ingénieurs\nVol\n2\nⓉ\n(\nInfinitesimal Analysis for Engineers Vol\n2\n)\n(1902)\n. He was president of the French Mathematical Society in\n1911\n. Lucien Lévy was the son of Edouard Lévy\n(1822\n-\n1900)\nand Hortense Breinlé Cahen\n(1832\n-\n1909)\n. Edouard Lévy, Paul's paternal grandfather, had graduated from the École Normale Supérieure in\n1843\nand also had a career as a professor of mathematics. Paul's mother, Alice Flora Wolff, was the daughter of Samuel Wolff\n(1827\n-\n1913)\n, Inspector General of the Ponts et Chaussées, and Fanny Goudchaux\n(1835\n-\n1888)\n.\nPaul attended three lycées in Paris, the lycée Montaigne from\n1895\nto\n1898\n, the lycée Louis le Grand from\n1898\nto\n1902\nand the lycée Saint Louis from\n1902\nto\n1904\n. At the lycée Montaigne, Lévy was taught literature and arts subjects and was certainly not the best student in his class, having three brilliant fellow-students, Jacques Massigli, Pierre Lachièze and Marc Bloch, who took the top three places. In early\n1898\nhis teacher M de la Filolie told him he had won the Greek prize in the Concours général. Lévy wrote\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nIt was to be my only literary success.\nÉmile Mâle was the professor of rhetoric at the lycée Louis le Grand when Lévy began studying there later in\n1898\n. His achievement in winning the Greek prize, however\n[\n2\n]\n:-\n... was not enough to draw the attention of Émile Mâle to me, who, from a great height, let fall on the best in the class a small part of his knowledge of Latin and of archaeological science.\nIt was mathematics that fired Lévy's passion at the lycée Louis le Grand. He wrote\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nIt is especially in plane geometry that I excelled. I visualise poorly in space, and I do not have the memory to have been impassioned by algebra, which did not prevent me ... to be also, in this discipline, to be at the top of my class. I was passionate about plane geometry; certain theorems were revelations for me: the notion of the power of a point in relation to a circle, that of a radical axis, that of the transformation of a figure by inversion, delighted me. What admirable methods for finding new theorems! I always found the problems easy that were presented to me. I was hoping to have the mathematics prize at the Concours Général en rhetorique; I did have it, and have not had the opportunity to participate in this competition since. Yet I make a huge difference between what I was when I was in literary studies and what I was going to be the following year.\nTo prepare for entry to the Grands Écoles, Lévy's father moved him from the lycée Louis le Grand to the lycée Saint Louis for his two final years of schooling. He explained\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nOn leaving rhetoric, after having learned the elements of trigonometry during the summer, I entered the Lycée Saint-Louis, in a class of elementary mathematics called higher .... My father thought that to prepare for the École Polytechnique, and possibly École Normale Supérieure, one should not waste time. I could prepare well for the baccalaureate in philosophy while doing mathematics in the lycée. In addition, as far as mathematics was concerned, I would have wasted my time if I had not skipped the preparatory class for the baccalaureate. But the upper class was of a higher standard in Louis Le Grand than in Saint Louis, and, in order not to require excessive effort from me, my father put me in Saint Louis. I have sometimes wondered if it would not have been better if I had stayed at Louis Le Grand. I'm sure I would have easily taken the mathematics class.\nIn his final year at the lycée Saint Louis,\n1903\n-\n04\n, Lévy was taught by Émile Blutel\n(1862\n-\n1932)\n. Blutel was a remarkable teacher who went on to publish a number of outstanding textbooks:\nLeçons de Mathématiques spéciales à l'École Normale Supérieure et des Étudiants des Facultés des Sciences\nⓉ\n(\nSpecial Mathematics Lessons at the École Normale Supérieure and Students of the Faculties of Sciences\n)\n(1914)\n;\nLeçons de mathématiques spéciales à l'usage des candidats à l'École Polytechnique: Géométrie analytique, courbes et surfaces\nⓉ\n(\nSpecial mathematics lessons for the use of candidates to the École polytechnique: Analytical geometry, curves and surfaces\n)\n(1914)\n; and\nLeçons de mathématiques spéciales, candidats à l'École Polytechnique et à l'École Normale Supérieure: Algébre, ligne droite et plan, trigonométrie, analyse, applications géométriques\nⓉ\n(\nSpecial mathematics lessons, candidates at the École polytechnique and at the École normale supérieure: Algebra, straight line and plane, trigonometry, analysis, geometric applications\n)\n(1914)\n.\nLévy was placed first for entry to the École Normale Supérieur and second for entry to the École Polytechnique in the Concours d'entrée for the two institutions. He chose to attend the École Polytechnique, considered less prestigious at that time, probably because of his father. While still an undergraduate there, he published his first paper\nSur les séries semi-convergentes\nⓉ\n(\nOn semi-convergent series\n)\nin\n1905\nand his second\nSur la densité des nombres premiers inférieurs à une grandeur donnée\nⓉ\n(\nOn the density of prime numbers less than a given number\n)\nin the following year. Writing about his professors, he singled out\nGeorges Humbert\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nThe most remarkable of our professors was certainly\nGeorges Humbert\n, and the course of analysis he gave us was the one from which I benefited the most. His presentations were always remarkably clear. My fellow students even claimed that it was too clear, and that he avoided difficulties that we noticed when studying the course on the sheets that were distributed to us. I only saw once, about the fundamental Jacobian theorem, that this was true. Among our other professors, I will name only\nHenri Poincaré\nand Henri Becquerel. The first was, in theory, a professor of astronomy; but the course was given by a substitute, except for the beginning.\nPoincaré\nhimself taught a lesson on spherical trigonometry and two lessons on error theory.\nAfter graduating in first place, Lévy took a year doing military service before studying for an engineering degree at the École des Mines in\n1907\n. While he studied at the École des Mines he also attended courses at the Sorbonne given by\nGaston Darboux\nand\nÉmile Picard\n. In addition he attended lectures at the Collège de France by\nGeorges Humbert\nand\nJacques Hadamard\n. Lévy wrote\n[\n31\n]\n:-\nAt the École des Mines, I neglected many of my courses in order to attend mathematics courses at the Sorbonne and at the College of France. I attended\nHumbert'\ns course for three years at the College of France. He is known for having been a marvellous calculator, and he contributed to the progress of classical mathematics. I was especially inclined towards the study of modern mathematics, and it was not\nHumbert'\ns course that I profited from the most. It was also not\nBorel\n's, which I gave up on after\n4\nor\n5\nlectures, because he spent too much time on what was obvious. On the other hand, I profited a great deal from\nEmile Picard\n's course, which I attended for one year, and from\nHadamard\n's, which I attended for three years. It was in\nHadamard\n's course, in\n1910\n, that I found my thesis topic.\nAs he explains, it was\nHadamard\nwho was the major influence in determining the topics on which Lévy would undertake research. Finishing his studies at the École des Mines in\n1910\nhe began research in\nfunctional analysis\n. His thesis on this topic,\nSur les equations intégro-differentielles définissant des fonctions de lignes\nⓉ\n(\nOn integro-differential equations defining line functions\n)\n, was examined by\nÉmile Picard\n,\nHenri Poincaré\nand\nJacques Hadamard\nin\n1911\nand he received his Docteur ès Sciences in\n1912\n.\nIn\n1913\nLévy married Suzanne Lévy\n(1892\n-\n1973)\n, a daughter of the merchant Paul Lévy\n(1853\n-\n1903)\nand Berthe Weil\n(1862\n-\n1930)\n.\n[\nSuzanne really did have a father and a husband with the same name!\n]\nSuzanne's maternal grandfather was Henri Weil\n(1817\n-\n1913)\n, a philologist and member of the Institut de France. Paul and Suzanne Lévy had three children, Marie-Hélène\n(\nborn November\n1913)\n, Denise\n(\nborn\n3\nOctober\n1916)\nand Jean Claude\n(\nborn\n10\nApril\n1918)\n.\nMarie-Hélène Lévy\nbecame a mathematician; she married\nLaurent Schwartz\n, taking the name\nMarie-Hélène Schwartz\n, and has a biography in this Archive. Denise became a professor of German at the lycée Molière in Paris. She married the engineer Robert Piron\n(\nmentioned below\n)\n. Jean Claude studied at the École Polytechnique and became an engineer in the navy.\nLévy became professor of mathematics at the École des Mines in Paris and a tutor at the École Polytechnique in Paris both in\n1913\n[\n4\n]\n:-\nA tutor's task was to help the students to understand the professors' lectures, and hence Lévy was well acquainted with the curriculum and the methods of instruction at the Polytechnique before his own appointment as professor.\nWorld War I caused major disruption in France as it did in most of Europe. Lévy undertook military service and was asked to use his mathematical skills in the war effort. He was assigned practical problems of defence, especially those arising from the then new technology associated with aviation, in particular solving problems concerning defence against attacks from the air.\nGeorge Humbert\n, who had taught at the École Polytechnique from\n1895\n, was one of the professors when Lévy was a tutor but he became seriously ill and he asked Lévy to substitute for him and take over part of his teaching commitments for session\n1918\n-\n19\n.\nHumbert\n's poor health led him to resign and Lévy became a full professor of analysis at the École Polytechnique in\n1920\n. Lévy remained at the École Polytechnique, with certain interruptions described below, until he retired in\n1959\n.\nA young mathematician\nRené Gateaux\nwas killed near the beginning of World War I and\nHadamard\nasked Lévy to prepare\nGateaux\n's work for publication. He did this but he did not stop at writing up\nGateaux\n's results, rather he took\nGateaux\n's ideas and developed them further publishing the material after the war had ended in\n1919\nas\nPublication des oeuvres posthumes de R Gateaux et notes personnelles complétant les résultats obtenus par cet auteur\nⓉ\n(\nPublication of posthumous works by R Gateaux and personal notes supplementing the results obtained by this author\n)\n.\nAs we indicated above Lévy first worked on functional analysis\n[\n33\n]\n:-\n... done in the spirit of\nVolterra\n. This involved extending the calculus of functions of a real variable to spaces where the points are curves, surfaces, sequences or functions.\nIn\n1919\n, as part of his teaching duties, Lévy was asked to give three lectures at the École Polytechnique on\n(\nsee\n[\n18\n]\n)\n:-\n... notions of calculus of probabilities and the role of Gaussian law in the theory of errors.\nTaylor writes in\n[\n32\n]\n:-\nAt that time there was no mathematical theory of\nprobability\n- only a collection of small computational problems. Now it is a fully-fledged branch of mathematics using techniques from all branches of modern analysis and making its own contribution of ideas, problems, results and useful machinery to be applied elsewhere. If there is one person who has influenced the establishment and growth of probability theory more than any other, that person must be Paul Lévy.\nThe contents of Lévy's lectures are described in\n[\n4\n]\n, which the authors end with the following summary:-\nLévy's lecture notes at the École Polytchnique in\n1919\nnicely document his beginnings as a probabilist. Though they are evidently not developed in the detail needed\n(\nwe must not forget that Lévy took the charge of the teaching at the drop of a hat\n)\n, they indicate how Lévy perceived probability on the eve of his exceptional second mathematical career. They contain the seeds of the studies Lévy would pursue with virtuosity for\n40\nyears: convergence in distribution, sums of random variables, the connection between mathematical probability and physics. They testify to what Lévy said about himself\n50\nyears later in an interview to the French radio France Culture: \"I have the feeling of being a mathematician, neither superior nor inferior to others, but different from them.\"\nLoève, in\n[\n19\n]\n, gives a very colourful description of Lévy's contributions:-\nPaul Lévy was a painter in the probabilistic world. Like the very great painting geniuses, his palette was his own and his paintings transmuted forever our vision of reality. ... His three main, somewhat overlapping, periods were: the limit laws period, the great period of additive processes and of martingales painted in pathtime colours, and the Brownian pathfinder period.\nNot only did Lévy contribute to probability and functional analysis but he also worked on partial\ndifferential equations\nand series. In\n1926\nhe extended\nLaplace\ntransforms to broader function classes. He undertook a large-scale work on generalised differential equations in functional derivatives. He also studied geometry.\nWorld War II presented serious difficulties for Lévy. On\n10\nMay\n1940\n, Germany invaded Holland, Belgium and Luxemburg then quickly moved to attack France by early June. On\n14\nJune German troops entered Paris and, on\n22\nJune, French Marshal Pétain signed an armistice. This divided France into Vichy France, controlled by a government collaborating with Germany, and a part under direct German control. The École Polytechnique had a certain military status and Germany refused to allow it to remain in Paris. It was relocated to Lyon, in Vichy France, and Lévy moved to Lyon and began teaching. Up to this point we have not mentioned that Lévy was Jewish since it was not relevant. Now, of course, it became a life-threatening difficulty. Legislation of\n3\nOctober\n1940\nrequired all Jews to be dismissed from their teaching and, on\n19\nDecember\n1940\nLévy received notice that he could no longer perform his duties. There were exemptions in the\n3\nOctober\n1940\nAct to allow those giving outstanding service to be exempted. An appeal by the director of the École Polytechnique succeeded and from\n14\nMarch\n1941\nhe was allowed again to teach.\nThe situation became worse in the summer of\n1942\nand Lévy, anticipating events, left Lyon and went to live with his son-in-law Robert Piron, in Montbonnot, near Grenoble in the Italian controlled region of France. He had left Lyon by\n4\nNovember ahead of the German invasion of Vichy France on\n11\nNovember. He now lived in hiding, carrying false documents, and somehow survived. A letter he wrote to\nMaurice Fréchet\non\n29\nNovember\n1943\nshows his extreme difficulties\n[\n25\n]\n:-\nI just learned that I'm not a professor at the École Polytechnique anymore. In early November, a postal check issued for my October salary was returned to me as \"not sufficient funds\". I wrote to the administration of the École to ask for an explanation. On\n24\nNovember, I received a copy of a decision dated\n30\nJune by which the École transferred me to the Corps des Mines on\n1\nOctober; it is also apparent from the text of the decision that on\n29\nApril the Director of the École knew already that I was not to be \"re-invested in my job\" and asked the Minister how long he had to pay me!!! And all this is legal, if one considers as legal a\n1941\nregulation subjecting teachers to a decennial re-election, regardless of acquired rights. And now what will the Corps des Mines do with me, having left the place in\n1913\n, and cannot give me work for which I have no longer any expertise and, in addition, with a delay of two months before taking up the post. Will it pay me? ... I deeply hope that\n1944\nwill see the end of these miseries.\nAlready by the time Lévy wrote this letter, part of the École Polytechnique was operating again in Paris\n(\nit had returned in April\n1943)\n, but some teaching was still taking place in Lyon for escaped prisoners, Jewish students and others who could not, at that time, return to Paris. After the Allied invasion of France in June\n1944\nthe German occupiers were driven back, and by August of that year the Vichy regime had fallen.\nThe war years were ones of great difficulties for Lévy, in Lyon, in Montbonnot, near Grenoble, and finally in the Loire, but he was still able to do mathematics\n[\n25\n]\n:-\nIn\n1940\n, Lévy had become one of the world major specialists of stochastic processes. And then suddenly, the\n55\nyears old mathematician who had produced a torrential flow of publications for more than\n20\nyears was deprived of the possibility to send articles to journals. Moreover, as we have seen, his teaching tasks were also gradually reduced, and for some months in\n1943\n, living in precarious silence in the Italian zone near Grenoble, Paul Lévy had nothing to do other than mathematics while waiting for better days. His luck was to remain in contact with\nFréchet\nwho played for him the role of a private registration journal and could also sometimes serve as a hub between Lévy and other mathematicians.\nBack in Paris, he continued to teach at the École des Mines until\n1951\nand at the École Polytechnique until\n1959\n. There were, however interruptions. He contracted tuberculosis and half his left lung was removed in\n1951\n. Again in\n1957\n-\n58\nhe was ill and could not teach, but recovered.\nLévy wrote ten books, the main ones being:\nLeçons d'analyse fonctionnelle\nⓉ\n(\nLessons in Functional Analysis\n)\n(1922)\n,\nCalcul des probabilités\nⓉ\n(\nCalculation of probabilities\n)\n(1925)\n,\nThéorie de l'addition des variables aléatoires\nⓉ\n(\nAddition theory of random variables\n)\n(1937\n;\n1954)\n, and\nProcessus stochastiques et mouvement brownien\nⓉ\n(\nStochastic processes and Brownian motion\n)\n(1948)\n. For information about all of Lévy's books, including contents of some of them and also extracts from some reviews, see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nFor Lévy's views on the calculus of probabilities see the English version of his talk\nLes fondements du calcul des probabilités\nⓉ\n(\nFoundations of the Calculus of Probabilities\n)\ndelivered to an audience at the École Polytechnique in the early\n1950\ns, see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nFor Levy's views on axiomatic set theory and the continuum hypothesis after the work of Kurt Gödel and Paul Cohen, see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nIn\n1963\nLévy was elected to honorary membership of the\nLondon Mathematical Society\n. In the following year he was elected to the\nAcadémie des Sciences\n.\nLoève sums up his article\n[\n19\n]\nin these words:-\n[\nLévy\n]\nwas a very modest man while believing fully in the power of rational thought. ... whenever I pass by the Luxembourg gardens, I still see us there strolling, sitting in the sun on a bench; I still hear him speaking carefully his thoughts. I have known a great man.\nLévy died in\n1971\nat the age of\n85\n. A memorial meeting in his memory was held in the\nHenri Poincaré\namphitheatre of the École Polytechnique on Friday\n23\nMarch\n1973\nwhen various talks were given. They were published in\nLa Jaune et la Rouge\nⓉ\n(\nThe Yellow and the Red\n)\nin November\n1973\n.\nFor an English version of\nLaurent Schwartz\n's talk,\nLa pensée mathématique de P Lévy\nⓉ\n(\nThe mathematical thought of P Lévy\n)\n, see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nFor an English version of\nPaul-André Meyer\n's talk\nL'originalité de P Lévy en mathématiques\nⓉ\n(\nThe originality of P Lévy in mathematics\n)\n, see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nFor an English version of\nBenoit Mandelbrot\n's talk\nPaul Lévy, professeur\n, and another description of Lévy by\nMandelbrot\n, see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nWe end this biography of Paul Lévy by quoting an extract from the talk\nPaul Lévy\n, delivered by Jean Ullmo\n(1906\n-\n1980)\nat the meeting on\n3\nMarch\n1973\n[\n35\n]\n:-\nPaul Lévy was one of the greatest mathematicians of his time and it is an honour for the Corps des Mines to have facilitated the full realization of his exceptional gifts. As a scholar, he was undoubtedly one of the last examples of absolute individualism: he was a solitary researcher who was only concerned with posing problems that interested him and pursuing their solution through only work of interior reflection. He read very little of the work of others, he did not participate in international congresses, except exceptionally at the end of his life. His working methods, artisanal one might say, had their drawbacks: he often found, without knowing it, already known results; more often still, he discovered important results without giving them the necessary publicity, sometimes because he believed them already known. It cannot be denied that there has been wasted effort, but the counterpart has often been admirable: it is the profound originality of a thought indifferent to fashions and schools which did not hesitate to embark on absolutely new paths because he had no fear of solitude. Thus, after having been one of the main precursors of functional analysis, Paul Lévy was the great creator of the theory of probability. It can be said that most of the essential concepts of this theory derive from him.\nHis teaching at the École Polytechnique, which was of exceptional duration, left a deep mark on his innumerable students: they saw in it a model of conciseness, a requirement vis-à-vis the reader who must recognize all the difficulties hidden in a laconic text; in short, an admirable piece of intellectual gymnastics. Let us add for the record that this very classic course which was little modified until\n1957\ndid not mean that Paul Lévy was losing interest in modern developments in mathematics since he had the courage and the elegance to undertake, in the last two years of his teaching, a redesign of his course to introduce the most recent language and methods.\nFinally, we would like to evoke a personal memory: Paul Lévy spoke to me one day about how he chose the questions on which he wanted to focus his research: \"I am asking myself a not too difficult problem,\" he said to me, \"so as not to break my teeth in front of an excess of difficulties, but all the same to have to make a big effort which occupies me and gives me the satisfaction of finding something.\" We will admire this modesty mixed with legitimate pride. These \"not too difficult problems\" were generally new avenues open to the human mind.",
