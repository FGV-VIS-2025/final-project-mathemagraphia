  "biografia": "Lochlainn O'Raifeartaigh\n's parents were Tarlach O'Raifeartaigh\n(1905\n-\n1984)\nand Neans Morrissey, known as Terry and Nancy Rafferty. Tarlach O'Raifeartaigh studied at University College, Dublin and was a Gaelic scholar who became Professor of History at St Patrick's Training College, Drumcondra, Dublin. Later he became Chairman of the Higher Education Authority and was Secretary to the Department of Education of Ireland.\nLochlainn's mother, Neans, was the daughter of T J Morrissey. She studied mathematics at University College, Dublin, and was awarded a First Class degree. She became the Assistant Secretary at the Department of Education. A very talented person, she spoke English, Irish, French, German and Swedish, was a Japanese scholar, and had a passion for music. Lochlainn, born on Kincora Road, Clontarf, Dublin, was the second eldest of his parents' six children, having an older sister, two younger brothers and two younger sisters.\nO'Raifeartaigh's primary school education was at St Joseph's school, run by the Christian Brothers, in the Marino district of Dublin. He then studied at St Vincent's Castleknock College, a school set up in the\n1830\ns in the Castleknock area of Dublin near Phoenix Park, designed to educate boys for the Catholic priesthood as well those aiming at a secular life. The College had\n254\npupils in\n1950\nwhen O'Raifeartaigh graduated. His school record was outstanding and he was ranked first in Mathematics in the Irish Leaving Certificate Examination. He was awarded a University Entrance Scholarship to study at University College, Dublin. His original intention had been to study engineering but he changed his mind before beginning his university studies, opting instead for a mathematical sciences degree. Before matriculating at University College, Dublin, he spent the summer of\n1950\ncycling to Rome with four of his fellow classmates from Castleknock College. He studied mathematical sciences for his first degree, attended lectures by\nErwin Schrödinger\n, and graduated in\n1954\nwith a B.Sc. with First Class Honours. He continued to study at University College, Dublin, and was awarded a M.Sc.\n(1\nst  Class\n)\nin\n1956\n.\nSchrödinger\nretired in\n1956\nand left Ireland to return to Austria so O'Raifeartaigh went to the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies where he worked under\nJohn Synge\nwho held the post of Senior Professor in the School of Theoretical Physics of the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies.\nIn addition to his studies of mathematics and physics at University College, Dublin, O'Raifeartaigh was also passionate about the Irish language. As an undergraduate he had joined An Cumann Gaelach\n(\nthe Gaelic Society\n)\nwhich held a yearly meeting in an Irish speaking region of Ireland. This Society, which was open to all students in Irish universities, both north and south, held a meeting in Teelin near Donegal which was attended by O'Raifeartaigh and Treasa Donnelly. Treasa was a student at Queen's University Belfast who was also passionately interested in the Irish language. In addition, she was a student of Celtic Studies in Belfast who shared O'Raifeartaigh's love of the theatre and of hill walking. They married in\n1958\nand had five children, three sons and two daughters: Conor, Finbar, Cormac, Una, and Aoife.\nO'Raifeartaigh began to undertake research towards his doctorate at the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies in\n1956\n, working under\nJohn Synge\n. In the following year,\n1957\n, he was awarded a scholarship by the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies which allowed him to continue his research abroad working with Walter Heitler\n(1904\n-\n1981)\nat the University of Zürich. Heitler, a leading expert on quantum theory, was a German Jew who had been forced to leave Germany in\n1933\n. He had been at the University of Bristol for eight years before\nSchrödinger\nhad arranged for him to go to Dublin and take up a professorship at the Institute for Advanced Studies. He had left Dublin in\n1949\nto take up a professorship at the University of Zürich. O'Raifeartaigh undertook research at Zürich, advised by Heitler, and was awarded a doctorate in\n1960\nfor his thesis\nNon Local Field Theories\n. Edmond Arnous had undertaken research in Paris working under\nLouis de Broglie\nand had then undertaken postdoctoral work with Heitler in Zürich. Heitler and Arnous had studied nonlocal field theories and, in his doctoral thesis, O'Raifeartaigh continued their work studying the\nS\nS\nS\n-matrix in their nonlocal field theory. He was happy in Zürich and his first child Conor was born in\n1960\n, the year he was awarded his doctorate. After obtaining his doctorate, O'Raifeartaigh returned to Dublin where he was appointed as an assistant professor of physics at the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies in\n1961\n. In the same year his second child Finbar was born.\nNot long after taking up this appointment, O'Raifeartaigh was on a visit to Bern, Switzerland, when he met by chance the Indian theoretical physicist Ennackal Chandy George Sudarshan. This led to O'Raifeartaigh being invited to lecture at the Mathematical Science Institute in Madras,\n(\nnow Chennai\n)\nIndia, which was just in the process of being founded in\n1962\n. This Institute promoted fundamental research in theoretical computer science, mathematics, and theoretical physics. O'Raifeartaigh spent three months over the winter of\n1963\n-\n64\nat the Mathematical Science Institute in Madras where he lectured on local\nLie\ngroups and their representations. Returning to Dublin in the spring of\n1964\n, he was awarded extended study leave which allowed him to make a lengthy research visit to Syracuse University in the United States. He had been invited to join Sudarshan's research group at Syracuse and he was delighted to be able to take advantage of the opportunity. Travelling to the United States with his family, he spent three years at Syracuse\n[\n5\n]\n:-\nAt Syracuse, O'Raifeartaigh made a discovery that established his reputation: He proved, in\n1965\n, that it was impossible to combine internal and geometric\n(\nrelativistic\n)\nsymmetries of the\nLie\ngroup type in a nontrivial way. This result, which became known as O'Raifeartaigh's Theorem, brought to an abrupt end major efforts to effect this combination. Brilliant application of group theoretical methods, as manifested in this work, became a unifying theme in his long and distinguished career.\nWriting about O'Raifeartaigh's Theorem, his son Cormac writes:-\n... the first proof of the 'impossibility' of combining internal symmetries with the\nPoincaré\nsymmetry of space-time was furnished by ... Lochlainn O'Raifeartaigh. The 'O'Raifeartaigh no-go theorem' was a hugely controversial result at the time and brought quite a few Ph.D. studies to an abrupt halt  ... My understanding is that the debate was finally closed when Coleman and Mandula published a generalization of the theorem. Given the controversy, it seems a pity that the original theorem is never referred to now\n(\nalthough it is liberally cited in the Coleman-Mandula paper\n)\n...  in other words Dad got all the flak but is now forgotten!\nRemaining in the United States, O'Raifeartaigh spent the academic years\n1967\n-\n68\nat the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton. He was offered a permanent position at Syracuse University but he now received an offer of a senior professorship at Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies. O'Raifeartaigh and his family had been very happy in Syracuse but they all felt that they should take the opportunity to return to Europe. In particular, they wanted to bring up their children in Ireland. He accepted the offer from Dublin where he would remain for the rest of his career. He did, however, spend some extended periods abroad. For example, he spent\n1975\n-\n76\nat the Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques at Bures-sur-Yyvette near Paris. The family lived in the Résidence de l'Ormaille, which housed visitors to the Institute, and the children attended local schools during this year. O'Raifeartaigh made a second visit to the Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques in\n1983\n-\n84\n. He also made a visit to the University of Notre Dame, Indiana, USA in\n1994\n. He was also active in the theoretical physics community in Ireland. Denis O'Sullivan writes\n[\n6\n]\n:-\nLochlainn was a great supporter of the Institute of Physics in Ireland. He attended our first meeting in Carrickmacross in\n1972\nand in later years was present at a number of IOP Spring weekends, both North and South, along with his wife Treasa. He kindly accepted an invitation to deliver a talk at our recent meeting in Newcastle, Co Down in\n1999\n. Indeed he had a great ability to explain difficult concepts of high-energy physics to theorists and experimentalists alike. His contributions to the\nRoyal Astronomical Society\nmeeting in Dublin in\n1982\n, and at the opening ceremony of the\n22\nnd\nInternational Cosmic Ray Conference to a packed National Concert Hall in August\n1991\n, will be remembered for their excitement and clarity.\nTheoretical physics developed rapidly from the\n1970\ns onwards with many of the new ideas related to areas in which O'Raifeartaigh was a leading expert, namely in using group theoretical methods. He made many fundamental contributions to non-abelian gauge theories. Siddhartha Sen in\n[\n6\n]\nlists his main contributions under the headings:\n(\ni\n)\nThe Effective Potential;\n(\nii\n)\nMagnetic Monopoles;\n(\niii\n)\nToda Theory and W-Algebras; and\n(\niv\n)\nSeiberg-\nWitten\nTheory. He published several important books, the first being\nLectures on Local Lie Groups and Their Representations\n(1964)\n. After editing\nGeneral Relativity; Papers in Honour of J L Synge\n(1972)\n, O'Raifeartaigh wrote a book on the topic for which he is most famous, namely\nLecture Notes on Supersymmetry\n(1975)\n. He begins the introduction by writing:-\nSupersymmetry is a new symmetry that has emerged in recent years. It has the property that it allows fields of different spin, and, in particular, boson and fermion fields, to appear in the same irreducible multiplet.\nHis next important book was the monograph\nGroup Structure of Gauge Theories\nin\n1986\n. He writes in the Preface:-\nIt has been known for many years that the gravitational and electromagnetic interactions of matter can be formulated as gauge theories - based on the\nLorentz\ngroup SO\n(3\n,\n1)\nand the compact 'internal' phase group U\n(1)\n, respectively. But over the past two decades it has gradually come to be accepted that the remaining two\n(\nknown\n)\nfundamental interactions of matter, namely the strong and weak nuclear interactions, are also gauge interactions, a property that has been hidden by confinement for the strong interactions and by spontaneous symmetry breaking for the weak ones. ... The aim of the present monograph is to provide a review of the group structure both of the non-abelian gauge theories themselves and of their spontaneous symmetry breaking.\nHe also wrote an important book\nThe Dawning of Gauge Theory\npublished by\nCambridge University Press\nin\n1997\n. The publisher gives this description:-\nDuring the course of this century, gauge invariance has slowly emerged from being an incidental symmetry of electromagnetism to being a fundamental geometrical principle underlying the four known fundamental physical interactions. The development has been in two stages. In the first stage\n(1916\n-\n1956)\nthe geometrical significance of gauge-invariance gradually came to be appreciated and the original abelian gauge-invariance of electromagnetism was generalized to non-abelian gauge invariance. In the second stage\n(1960\n-\n1975)\nit was found that, contrary to first appearances, the non-abelian gauge-theories provided exactly the framework that was needed to describe the nuclear interactions\n(\nboth weak and strong\n)\nand thus provided a universal framework for describing all known fundamental interactions. In this work, Lochlainn O'Raifeartaigh describes the former phase. O'Raifeartaigh first illustrates how gravitational theory and quantum mechanics played crucial roles in the reassessment of gauge theory as a geometric principle and as a framework for describing both electromagnetism and gravitation. He then describes how the abelian electromagnetic gauge-theory was generalized to its present non-abelian form. The development is illustrated by including a selection of relevant articles, many of them appearing here for the first time in English, notably by\nWeyl\n,\nSchrödinger\n,\nOskar Klein\n, and London in the pre-war years, and by\nPauli\n, Shaw, Yang, Mills, and Utiyama after the war. The articles illustrate that the reassessment of gauge-theory, due in a large measure to\nWeyl\n, constituted a major philosophical as well as technical advance.\nThe\nAmerican Journal of Physics\nreviewed the book:-\nThe book thus performs a double service: it offers a rewarding description of the development of the gauge symmetry idea that is complete even without the original papers, and it makes those original papers readily accessible to physicists and mathematicians. ... This book represents an important contribution to the history of fundamental ideas in physics.\nWe should mention O'Raifeartaigh's collaborations with scientists from Eastern Europe, especially Hungary, Poland and the USSR, throughout the late cold war. Many were able to make research visits to the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies. In particular there were physicists such as J Balog from the Central Research Institute for Physics, Budapest, Hungary, L Fehér from the\nBolyai\nInstitute, Szeged, Hungary, P Forgacs from the Central Research Institute for Physics, Budapest, Hungary, and P A Horváthy now in Tours, France. Fehér and Horváthy dedicated a\n2009\nelectronic version of their\n1989\npaper\nApplications of chiral supersymmetry for spin fields in self-dual backgrounds\nwritten with O'Raifeartaigh to \"our late teacher, collaborator and friend\".\nO'Raifeartaigh received several major honours for his outstanding contributions including election to the\nRoyal Irish Academy\nin\n1963\n, election as a fellow of the Institute of Physics in\n1990\n, election to the Academia Europaea in\n1991\n, awarded the prestigious von Humbolt Research Award in\n1996\nand the\nEugene Wigner\nMedal in August\n2000\n. The\nWigner\nMedal, designed \"to recognize outstanding contributions to the understanding of physics through group theory\" was awarded for his:-\n... pioneering contributions to particle physics.\nAn international symposium, 'Symposium on Non-Perturbative and Symmetry Methods in Field Theory', was held in Budapest in June\n2006\nto celebrate O'Raifeartaigh's life and work.\nWe mentioned O'Raifeartaigh's love of the Irish language, of the theatre and of hill walking above. He was also interested in politics and tried to put this interest to use to make a better world\n[\n3\n]\n:-\nHe put his interest in international politics to good use in the cause of nuclear disarmament; along with the Nobel Laureate Ernest Walton, he helped Michael Fry found the Irish Pugwash group, bringing together physicists and experts on international affairs.\nAs to his character\n[\n3\n]\n:-\n... he will be remembered by his colleagues as much for his humility, patience, kindness and humour as for his academic excellence.\nThe authors of\n[\n5\n]\nwrite:-\nHe was a man of faith. His friends admired him for his simplicity, thoughtfulness, kindness, humour, and extensive knowledge of physics.\nAfter a short illness, O'Raifeartaigh died from liver cancer at the age of\n67\n.",
