  "biografia": "Stanisława Nikodym\nwas given the name\nStanisława Dorota Liliental\nand only became Stanisława Nikodym after her marriage to Otton Nikodym. To avoid confusion, we shall refer to her as Stanisława throughout this biography. She was the daughter of Natan Nuchim Liliental\n(1868\n-\n1927)\nand his wife Regina Gitla Eiger\n(1877\n-\n1924)\n. The family were Polish speaking Jews living in Warsaw which was, at that time, part of the Russian Empire. Natan Liliental, the son of the author Maximilian Liliental, had been born in Kutno, and was an agent for a bank. He married Regina Eiger in an Orthodox synagogue in Szczebrzeszyn. She had been born in\n1875\nin Zawichost, a town near Sandomierz, and was the great-great-granddaughter of the Talmudic scholar Rabbi Akiva Eger. Shortly after her marriage Regina moved with her husband to Warsaw where she attended secret lectures in private homes, the so-called \"Flying University\". At this time the Russian authorities did not permit Poles to study at higher levels. She became a history teacher in a school for Jewish girls, and was the author of many books and articles on Jewish culture as well as translating Jewish poems into Polish. Her great-granddaughter Dorota Liliental writes\n[\n7\n]\n:-\nThanks to the books she has written, the rituals, fables, legends, songs and proverbs of the world that seemed to have been expunged by the Holocaust can be revived today.\nRegina and Natan Liliental had two children, Stanisława Dorota Liliental, the subject of this biography, born in\n1897\n, and Antoni Tadeusz Liliental, born\n26\nOctober\n1908\n. Antoni became a chemical engineer, worked at the Warsaw Polytechnic University, but joined the Polish Army at the start of World War II and was killed by the Russians during the Katyn Massacre in April and May of\n1940\nwhen over\n20\n,\n000\nprisoners of war were murdered.\nStanisława studied in Warsaw, spending six years of primary education at a school run by Helena Szalay, a sister of Marie Curie. Helena Szalay had, like Stanisława's mother, studied at the \"Flying University\" in Warsaw. She had applied to attend lectures in chemistry and physics at the Jagiellonian University in Kraków but, being a woman, her request had been denied. After attending this school, Stanisława spent seven years of secondary education at a private gymnasium for young women. She was studying at this school in Warsaw when World War I broke out in\n1914\n. Now at this time Warsaw was in the Russian controlled region of Poland, and at the start of the war Warsaw housed many Russian troops. Battles were fought in the vicinity of Warsaw without much progress by either side, but in July\n1915\nRussian troops began a retreat and, on\n5\nAugust\n1915\n, German troops captured Warsaw. Central Poland now came under German occupation and this produced a major change in education. On\n15\nNovember\n1915\nthe University of Warsaw was given permission by the Germans to open and teach in Polish. For the first time, women were allowed to study at the university.\nIn\n1916\nStanisława completed her secondary school studies and passed her final examination. On\n18\nOctober\n1916\nshe entered the Faculty of Philosophy of the University of Warsaw. She studied mathematics, attending courses by\nStefan Mazurkiewicz\n,\nZygmunt Janiszewski\n, and\nWacław Sierpiński\n.\nKazimierz Kuratowski\nwas at this time a student at the newly reopened University of Warsaw and he writes\n[\n6\n]\n:-\nAs early as\n1917\nJaniszewski\nand\nMazurkiewicz\nwere conducting a topology seminar, presumably the first in that new, exuberantly developing field. The meeting of that seminar, taken up to a large extent with sometimes quite vehement discussions between\nJaniszewski\nand\nMazurkiewicz\n, were a real intellectual treat for the participants.\nWorld War I ended with an armistice on\n11\nNovember\n1918\nbut Germany troops still occupied much of Poland. A uprising broke out in Poland with members of the Polish military fighting for an independent Poland. Stanisława took a break in her studies for the academic year\n1918\n-\n19\nand spent the year teaching mathematics to Polish army recruits. After this she returned to the University of Warsaw to continue her studies.\nIn addition to those mentioned above, Stanisława was taught mathematics by several others. These included\nSamuel Dickstein\n, Stefan Kwietniewski\n(1874\n-\n1940)\n, Stanisław Leśniewski\n(1886\n-\n1939)\n, Antoni Przeborski\n(1871\n-\n1941)\n, Witold Pogorzelski\n(1895\n-\n1963)\n,\nJan Łukasiewicz\n, and Juliusz Rudnicki\n(1881\n-\n1848)\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nThere is no doubt that\nJaniszewski\n,\nMazurkiewicz\n,\nKuratowski\n, and\nSierpiński\nhad a huge impact on Stanisława's mathematical education. In\n1919\n, she attended two courses by\nJaniszewski\n: selected topics in topology and a seminar on topology. It must have been\nJaniszewski\nwho introduced her to the problem of continua disconnecting a plane, the problem of her doctoral dissertation. In\n1921\n,\nMazurkiewicz\nlectured on Jordanian continua, which was also one of her interests.\nMathematics was not Stanisława's only passion, for she also loved painting, and wrote poems and plays. While still a student, in\n1922\nshe participated in outdoor painting in Sandomierz, where she painted views of the city using watercolour techniques. Here is one of the paintings she made in Sandomierz in\n1922\nwhich is now in the District Museum in Sandomierz.\nSee\nTHIS LINK\n.\nIn fact she did open-air painting over several of the following summers and her work was exhibited in\n1933\nafter which she donated it to the District Museum in Sandomierz.\nStanisława spent her\n1923\nsummer holiday in Zakopane, a resort at the foot of the Tatra Mountains. Many of the Polish mathematicians spent their summer holidays in Zakopane so as well as a holiday it was a chance to discuss mathematics with others. She wrote to her mother on\n30\nJuly\n1923\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nYesterday I met professor\nStanisław Ruziewicz\nfrom Lwów. I spent the entire evening enjoying sweets and a lively discussion in the company of professors of mathematics.\nAmong the mathematicians Stanisława met in Zakopane was\nOtton Nikodym\n. Otton and Stanisława were married in Warsaw in a Roman Catholic ceremony on\n2\nApril\n1924\n. Stanisława had by this time completed her first degree from the University of Warsaw and the couple returned to Kraków where they lived in\nOtton\n's small apartment on Kochanowskiego Street. Both of them decided to register to study for their doctorates at the University of Warsaw.\nIn\n[\n2\n]\nDanuta Ciesielska writes:-\nIt is commonly believed that it was\nSierpiński\nwho encouraged\nOtton\nto start publishing his results, but I am certain that is not the truth. The correspondence of the newly married couple with Stanisława's family presents the story in a different way. In my opinion, Stanisława and some friends from Kraków had far more impact on\nOtton\nthan\nSierpiński\ndid.\nWe can picture the young couple at this time from a description that Stanisława's mother wrote in a letter of May\n1924\n(\nsee, or example,\n[\n2\n]\n)\n:-\nThey often sit together studying algebra, and\nOtton\ntold me that she\n[\nStanisława\n]\nis extremely talented, has a masculine mind, and yet is so feminine and childlike.\nStanisława Nikodym wrote to her mother on\n26\nOctober\n1924\n(\nsee, for example,\n[\n2\n]\n)\n:-\nOtton\nsays that we must learn to fight against all the obstacles that fate sends our way and appreciate our victory, when we will receive the necessary diplomas for which we are striving and embark upon a new creative life.\nOtton\nbelieves that I will accomplish very nice things, for he sees how I am going about mathematics. Really, I have benefited a lot recently and I owe a great deal to\nOtton\n. He said that he senses all the happiness coming to us together, including good health and our doctorates.\nIn November\n1924\nthe Nikodyms moved to Warsaw. Stanisława was sad at leaving her family and she also believed that she stood a better chance of finding employment in Warsaw. In Warsaw they moved in with Stanisława's parents in Koszykowa Street. Perhaps Regina's poor health was a factor in Stanisława wishing to be in Warsaw for Regina had surgery and died on\n4\nDecember\n1924\nfrom complications following the operation. Stanisława undertook research for her doctorate advised by\nStefan Mazurkiewicz\nand was awarded the degree on\n26\nJune\n1925\nfor her thesis\nO rozcinaniu płaszczyzny przez zbiory spójne i kontinua\nⓉ\n(\nOn the dissection of the plane by coherent sets and continua\n)\n. The award of a Ph.D. in\n1925\nmeans that Stanisława Nikodym became the first Polish woman to be awarded a doctorate in mathematics.\nStanisława and her husband moved to Kraków, where\nOtton\nwas employed at the Jagiellonian University. She began to publish papers, the first of which is\nSur les coupures du plain faites par les ensembles connexes et les continus\nⓉ\n(\nOn the cuts in the plain made by connected sets and continua\n)\npublished in\nFundamenta Mathematicae\nin\n1925\n. The paper has no introduction or statement about what is going to be proved. It begins with a summary of the required notation, then states theorems due to\nZygmunt Janiszewski\nand\nFelix Hausdorff\nthat are to be used, before stating and proving Lemmas\n1\nand\n2\n.\nStanisława and\nOtton\nspent the academic year\n1926\n-\n27\nat the Sorbonne but it was a difficult year barely surviving on a very small Polish scholarship. In September\n1928\nStanisława participated in the International Congress of Mathematicians in Bologna, Italy and delivered the lecture\nSur une propriété topologique du plan Euclidien\nⓉ\n(\nOn a topological property of the Euclidean plane\n)\n. Her talk begins as follows:-\nIn my work published in the XII volume of 'Fundamenta Mathematicae' I have demonstrated a lemma which can be regarded as analogous to the following very elementary theorem.\n\"If\np\n1\n,\np\n2\n,\n.\n.\n.\n,\np\nn\n,\n.\n.\n.\np_{1}, p_{2}, ..., p_{n}, ...\np\n1\n​\n,\np\n2\n​\n,\n.\n.\n.\n,\np\nn\n​\n,\n.\n.\n.\nis a sequence of different real numbers tending to p, we can extract from it a partial sequence which converges to p in a monotonic manner\".\nThe lemma I am talking about expresses a property of the plane and, basically, it is contained in a method of\nR L Moore\nused by American topologists to deal with different questions concerning Jordanian continua.\n...\nIt is by means of the notion of monotonic convergence that I have demonstrated in the XII volume of  'Fundamenta Mathematicae' a theorem expressing a necessary and sufficient condition for a subcontinuum of a Jordanian and plane continuum to be itself Jordanian. By means of a slightly different notion, I recently found with\nOtton Nikodym\na necessary and sufficient condition which must be satisfied by a Jordanian continuum and plane J, so that the property of being Jordanian for any subcontinuum C of J, is equivalent to the known property, found by\nR L Moore\nfor the relative complement J-C.\nThe paper in Volume\n12\nof the\nFundamenta Mathematicae\nthat Stanisława refers to in this quote is\nSur une condition nécessaire et suffisante pour qu'un sous-continu d'un continu jordanien et plan soit lui-même jordanien\nⓉ\n(\nOn a necessary and sufficient condition for a subcontinuum of a Jordan continuum and plane to be Jordan itself\n)\n(1928)\n. She published a second paper\nSur quelques propriétés des ensembles partout localement connexes\nⓉ\n(\nOn some properties of locally connected sets everywhere\n)\nalso in Volume\n12\nof the\nFundamenta Mathematicae\nand two further papers in\n1930\nin addition to her paper in the\nProceedings\nof the Bologna Congress which also appeared in\n1930\n.\nIn the period\n1930\n-\n1945\nthe Nikodyms lived in Warsaw. In\n1930\nStanisława was appointed as an assistant to\nFranciszek Leja\nwho at that time was head of the Department of Mathematics at the Faculty of Chemistry of the Technical University of Warsaw. She took over this position from\nKazimierz Zarankiewicz\nwho had been\nLeja\n's assistant for the previous eight years. Stanisława continued to work as\nLeja\n's assistant until\n1936\nwhen he left Warsaw to take up the chair of mathematics at the Jagiellonian University in Kraków. From\n1936\nshe did some work for a publishing house but had no permanent job. During the years at the Technical University of Warsaw she published the paper\nUne propriété topologique de la surface partout localement homéomorphe au plan Euclidien\nⓉ\n(\nA topological property of the everywhere surface locally homeomorphic to the Euclidean plane\n)\n(1935)\nand the books\nWybrane zadania z analizy matematycznej\nⓉ\n(\nSelected problems in mathematical analysis\n)\n(1936)\nand\n(\nwith\nOtto M Nikodym\n)\nWst p do rachunku ró niczkowego\nⓉ\n(\nIntroduction to differential calculus\n)\n(1936)\n. Both these books ran to second editions, in\n1946\nand\n1947\nrespectively.\nWorld War II began on\n1\nSeptember\n1939\nwhen Germany invaded Poland. By\n8\nSeptember the German troops has reached Warsaw and on\n17\nSeptember the Soviet Union attacked Poland from the east. By\n27\nSeptember Germany was in complete control of Warsaw and the Nikodyms were is great danger, especially since Stanisława was Jewish. Edward Ordman writes\n[\n8\n]\n:-\nDuring the war, of course, the German Nazis were fairly efficient at exterminating the Polish intelligentsia.\nNikodym\nand his wife escaped into the countryside, disguised as peasants. They were sheltered for the duration of the war in a small village, hidden and fed by the peasants. In exchange for being taken care of, they tutored the village children in arithmetic, and sometimes in other subjects, generally at the primary level.\nStanisława went with her husband to Kraków when he took up an appointment at the Mining Academy on\n1\nApril\n1945\n. Towards the end of\n1946\nStanisława and her husband went first to Belgium and then to France. The couple went from France to London, England, where they attended a conference. William Transue, from Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio, USA was at the conference and, when he heard that the Nikodyms wanted to stay in the West, said he would try to get\nOtton\na job offer from his College. Transue contacted the President of Kenyon College who quickly sent\nOtton\nthe offer of a position at the College. Stanisława and her husband sailed from Southampton to New York on the\nMarine Flasher\nleaving Southampton on\n21\nMarch\n1948\nand arriving in New York on\n31\nMarch. On her entry to the United States Stanisława declared her final destination to be Gambier, Ohio and that she intended to apply for American citizenship and become a permanent resident. Her entry record contains the following details: Height,\n5\nft\n2\nin; Hair Colour, Brown; Eye Colour, Brown; Complexion, Medium. She gives her occupation as 'housewife', her race as 'Italian' and, rather strangely, gives her place of birth as Moscow, Russia.\nAt Kenyon College, Stanisława was appointed as an Assistant Professor of Mathematics. The news of her appointment was given in\nThe Kenyon Collegian\non\n8\nOctober\n1948\n[\n10\n]\n:-\nDr Stanisława Nikodym\n[\nis appointed\n]\nas visiting Assistant Professor of Mathematics. Dr Nikodym was born in Moscow and studied at the Gymnasium of Latin in Warsaw and the University of Warsaw where she was granted her Doctor's degree in Mathematics. She was an instructor in Higher Mathematics for six years at the Higher Polytechnical School in Warsaw and has delivered lectures on topology to the International Congress of Mathematicians at Bologna. She is the author of numerous textbooks and papers, printed in Polish, Italian, and French.\nOtto Nikodym\nwas appointed as a professor of mathematics at Kenyon College and was assisted in many ways by Stanisława. Edward Ordman writes in\n[\n8\n]\nabout the Nikodyms at Kenyon College:-\nIn the early days\n[\nat Kenyon College\n]\nthe Nikodyms went to class together; he lectured from a prepared text and she helped field the questions.  They were a dramatic contrast to the usual inhabitants of central Ohio, moving together through this strange culture and language.  The small college town was a big help: there was usually someone who could translate, by way of French or German, if there was difficulty communicating in the butcher shop or at the barber, and the shopkeepers knew the college would straighten out any problems By a few years later, his English had improved enough to manage questions himself and his wife no longer needed to attend his classes.\nBy the time I was a student at Kenyon and took a course from\nNikodym\n(\nan introduction to\nHilbert\nSpace, using the text by\nHalmos\n)\nin the early\n1960\n's, he was in his eighties.  A small man, somewhat stooped over, he was driven to work every morning by his wife. She followed two paces behind as he walked to his office, removed his coat for him and hung it up, then went home until she returned for him in the evening. ... A high point of our undergraduate education was being invited home for dinner at the\nNikodym\nhome. It was a small but elegant apartment carved from a large house on a  hilltop owned by the college, built well over a century ago as the palace of the then Episcopal Bishop of Ohio. Mrs Nikodym served what seemed to us a very European dinner, and with some prompting from her husband told of their earlier lives and especially their hiding out during the Second World War.\nAfter settling in the United States, Stanisława only published two papers both joint publications with her husband. These are\nSur l'extension des corps algébriques abstraits par un procédé généralisé de Cantor\nⓉ\n(\nOn the extension of abstract algebraic fields by a generalized Cantor procedure\n)\n(1955)\nand\nSome theorems on divisibility of infinite cardinals\n(1957)\n.\nIn\n1965\nboth Stanisława and her husband\nOtton\nretired and went to live in Utica, Oneida County, New York.\nOtton Nikodym\ndied on\n3\nMay\n1974\nand is buried in Our Lady of Częstochowa Cemetery in Doylestown, Pennsylvania, named after Częstochowa, the most holy religious site in Poland. We should explain why he was buried there. Soon after the Nikodyms arrived in the United States they made friends with the famous Polish painter Adam Styka and his wife Wanda. This friendship was, of course, a natural one given that Stanisława was a painter. The Pauline Father, Michał Zembrzuski, later joined this group of friends. It was Father Zembrzuski, who had come to the United States in\n1951\nto do missionary work among Poles in America, who built the American Częstochowa church near Doylestown in\n1965\n-\n66\n. Father Zembrzuski conducted\nOtton Nikodym\n's funeral and his burial in Our Lady of Częstochowa Cemetery. The grave is close to that of Adam Styka who died in\n1959\n.\nOtton\n's tombstone was designed by Stanisława and it is highly decorated and very colourful. Stanisława clearly intended to be buried beside her husband since she had her name on the tombstone with her death date still to be added. Following\nOtton\n's death, Stanisława made visits to Poland and she died on\n26\nMarch\n1988\nin Jeżewo Stare, Podlachia, Poland and was buried in Tykocin.",
