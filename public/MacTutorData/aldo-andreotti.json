  "biografia": "Aldo Andreotti\n's father was the noted Italian sculptor Libero Andreotti\n(1875\n-\n1933)\n. After his secondary education, Aldo entered the Scuola Normale Superiore in Pisa in October\n1942\nwhere he attended courses by\nLeonida Tonelli\n. However, after divisions of the German army entered Italy in\n1943\n, Andreotti escaped to Switzerland since all Italian men over the age of\n18\nrisked being deported by the Germans to labour camps, from which many did not return. He made his way to Lausanne, on the shores of Lake Geneva, and attended courses at the university there, in particular attending\nGeorges de Rham\n's lectures and those of\nBeno Eckmann\n. Andreotti was able to return to Italy after the end of World War II and completed his doctorate at Pisa in\n1947\nwith a thesis on conformal representations.\nAndreotti's research at Pisa resulted in five papers which were published in\n1948\n:\nLe serie lineari sopra retta multipla e in particulare sopra una retta doppia\nⓉ\n(\nLinear series on multiple lines and in particular on double lines\n)\n;\nQuestioni di equivalenza relative alle curve riducibili e ai punti base di un fascio di curve sopra una superfice algebrica I\nⓉ\n(\nIssues of equivalence relating to curves and reducible to the basic points of a bundle of curves on an algebraic surface I\n)\n;\nQuestioni di equivalenza relative alle curve riducibili e ai punti base di un fascio di curve sopra una superfice algebrica II\nⓉ\n(\nIssues of equivalence relating to curves and reducible to the basic points of a bundle of curves on an algebraic surface II\n)\n;\nSulle corrispondenza fra due curve bi razionalmente distinte a moduli generali e sui modelli minimi dei loro prodotti\nⓉ\n(\nOn the correspondence between two curves birationally distinct general modules and minimum models of their products\n)\n; and\nApplicazione di un theorema di Schottley-Cecioni allo studio della geometria sopra una curve ellittica in relazione con quello sopra due curve ellittiche reali del tipo di Harnavk\nⓉ\n(\nApplication of a theorema of Schottley-Cecioni to the study of geometry over an elliptic curve in connection with the above two real elliptic curves of Harnavk type\n)\n. After graduating from Pisa, Andreotti went to Rome where he studied for three years with\nFrancesco Severi\n.\nSeveri\nwas, by this time, involved in many non-mathematical pursuits, but these years, first as a research student at the National Institute of Advanced Mathematics\n(\nINdAM\n)\n, and later as an assistant in geometry, were important years during which Andreotti became an extremely innovative mathematician. His interest in\nalgebraic geometry\n, which had begun while he was in Pisa, developed greatly under\nSeveri\n's guidance.\nSeveri\nquickly realised that he had an extremely talented pupil and greatly admired Andreotti's talents.\nIn\n1950\nAndreotti went to the Princeton in the United States where he spent several months. This was an important period for Andreotti who came in contact with leading mathematicians such as\nKunihiko Kodaira\n,\nSolomon Lefschetz\n,\nCarl Ludwig Siegel\n,\nDonald Spencer\n,\nAndré Weil\nand\nOscar Zariski\n. This time at Princeton allowed Andreotti to greatly broaden his mathematical knowledge, for he learnt about the latest developments in algebra, general topology,\nalgebraic topology\nand other areas which at that time were not being studied in Italy. He returned to Italy, entered the national competition for the selection of a full Professor of Geometry at the University of Turin and was interviewed in November\n1951\n.\nBeniamino Segre\nwas one of the judges on the selection committee that chose Andreotti who, within a few weeks, moved to Turin. He quickly made a substantial impact on the teaching of mathematics there\n[\n3\n]\n:-\nIn Turin, that little revolution in teaching began ... in\n1951\n, with the arrival of Aldo Andreotti. Then barely twenty-seven years old, Andreotti had reached an absolutely stunning maturity, coming in large measure from long months spent in the United States close to remarkable mathematicians ... At his arrival at Turin, Andreotti had some certainties. All Italian mathematicians were a bit ignorant, but especially the researchers of algebraic geometry; the old venerated master\nSeveri\nwas often an obstacle to updating because he didn't encourage young people enough to look at other schools which he considered competitive to the Italian one which he defended at all costs. It was absurd to continue to teach descriptive geometry in the first two years of the mathematics course and Andreotti replaced this by several topics in algebra such as ideal theory, polynomials, resultants etc.\nAndreotti married Barbara Wilkinson Jenkins in\n1953\n. Barbara was an American, the daughter of Professor John Jenkins and Ruth Parker from Athens, Georgia, USA. She had studied English literature and music, attending the University of Georgia, Radcliffe College and the University of Rochester. Before her marriage to Andreotti, she worked for the United States Government in Washington, D.C., and in Rome, Italy. Aldo and Barbara Andreotti had four children: Margherita, Maria Tecla, Libero and Felicita.\nIn\n1956\nAndreotti left Turin and went to the University of Pisa. He spent the rest of his career at Pisa, although he spent much time abroad visiting the University of Nancy, the University of Paris, Göttingen University, the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, Strasbourg University, Brandeis University in Waltham, Massachusetts, Stanford University in Palo Alto, California and Oregon State University at Corvallis, Oregon. It was during one of his visits to the United States that he met\nAlexander Grothendieck\nwho gives this description in\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nAmong my many friends in this world ... the only other which I think has had a clear perception is Aldo Andreotti. I had made his acquaintance, and that of his wife Barbara and their twin children\n(\neven toddlers\n)\nin\n1955\n(\nat a party of\nAndré Weil\n's in Chicago, I think\n)\n. ... Aldo had an acute sensitivity, which had in no way been dulled by dealings with mathematics and with \"stars\" like me. There was in him a gift of spontaneous sympathy for those he approached. This set him apart from all other friends I've known among mathematicians, or even outside mathematics. With him friendship always took precedence over common mathematical interests\n(\nwhich he did not lack\n)\n, and he is one of the few mathematicians with whom I have talked about my life, and he about his. His father, like mine, was Jewish, and he had to suffer in Mussolini's Italy, like me in Hitler's Germany. I saw him always ready to encourage and support young researchers, in a climate where it became difficult to be accepted by the establishment. His interest was always spontaneously directed first to the person, not to \"potential\" mathematics or to fame. He was one of the most endearing people I have had the opportunity to meet.\nAndreotti published over\n100\npapers. Up to\n1958\nhis papers are all single-authored, but after that date the majority of them are co-authored with mathematicians such as\nHans Grauert\n, Mauro Nacinovich, Raghavan Narasimhan, François Norguet, C Denson Hill, Wilhelm Stoll, and Edoardo Vesentini. His early work was on algebraic geometry but he went on to make major contributions to the theory of several complex variables and to partial differential operators. Perhaps his most famous results are his proof of the theorem of\nLeonida Tonelli\n(1958)\n, his proof of the duality of\nPicard\nand\nAlbanese\nvarieties of algebraic surfaces, his work with A L Mayer on the Schottky problem\n(1967)\n, and the Andreotti-Vesentini separation theorem which appeared in their joint\n1965\npaper\nCarleman estimates for the Laplace-Beltrami equation on complex manifolds\n. This theorem states that certain cohomology groups of coherent sheaves are separated. This result put into a differential-geometric setting finiteness theorems that Andreotti, in collaboration with\nHans Grauert\n, had published three years earlier in\nThéorèmes de finitude pour la cohomology of the complexes espaces\nⓉ\n(\nFiniteness theorems for the cohomology of complex spaces\n)\nconcerning cohomology with coefficients on a locally free sheaf on a complex manifold. H Rossi, reviewing the\n1965\npaper, writes:-\nThe authors give a lucid exposition of all the techniques used; in particular, there is a full discussion of the relevant topological spaces, called\nFréchet\n-\nSchwartz\nspaces. Besides the finiteness theorems, there is also a general extension theorem for forms with coefficients in a vector bundle defined near the boundary of a complex manifold.\nAndreotti was invited to lecture at the International Congress of Mathematicians at Stockholm in\n1962\n. He gave the address\nComplex pseudoconcave spaces and automorphic functions\n. He was invited again in\n1970\nwhen he gave the lecture\nE E Levi convexity and H Lewy problem\n. Many of his invitations to give courses of lectures resulted in major publications such as\nNine lectures on complex analysis\ngiven at the Centro Internazionale Matematico Estivi in Bressanone, Italy in\n1973\nand\nComplexes of partial differential operators\nwhich were the James K Whittemore Lectures in Mathematics he was invited to give at Yale University in May\n1974\n. Monty Strauss, reviewing the monograph that was the published form of these Yale lectures writes:-\nThe author extends various classical results of the theory of\nCauchy\n-\nRiemann\nequations to general complexes of linear partial differential operators. The monograph begins by examining elementary and Levi convexity and then discusses the\nHans Lewy\nproblem. Both the\nDirichlet\nand\nCauchy\nproblems are examined in the context of cohomology theory through complexes of differential operators. Classical theorems on removable singularities and existence and uniqueness of solutions to the\nCauchy\nproblem are extended to some systems of partial differential operators through this technique.\nOther books by Andreotti are:\n(\nwith Wilhelm Stoll\n)\nAnalytic and algebraic dependence of meromorphic functions\n(1971)\n;\nÉtude de géometrie algébrique\nⓉ\n(\nStudy of algebraic geometry\n)\n(1979)\n; and\n(\nwith Mauro Nacinovich\n)\nAnalytic convexity and the principle of Phragmén-Lindelöf\n(1980)\n. A review of the first of these books begins as follows:-\nThe sophisticated expert may sneer at the inclusion of this and other introductory material and at the proofs of some facts \"well known\" to him and perhaps to him alone. As a plumber has to assemble and adjust his tools for a new job, so the mathematician has to ready his tools. Often enough, this task is neglected or omitted. Such a paper is difficult to read and may be even inaccessible to those less acquainted with the general subject area. Although this monograph is essentially a research paper, it is self contained and should be accessible to a reader who is familiar with the basic concepts of the field as provided in an introductory course or a standard textbook\nOne of Andreotti's students recalled a memorable lecture by Andreotti in a lecture room in the old Palazzo dei Cavalieri of the Scuola Normale Superiore:-\nThe students were waiting anxiously for the famous geometer, Aldo Andreotti, a legend of modern day Italian mathematics. ... a clumsy, chubby fellow shows up and announces that Professor Andreotti will be late, and that he will start the lecture in his stead. ... the fellow writes formulae monotonously, one after the other, on the wide chalky blackboard. ... suddenly, as if materializing out of thin air, Professor Andreotti shows up. He stares at the formulae, dismisses briskly the chubby and clumsy fellow, and begins writing, as if talking to himself. ... as suddenly as he had appeared, he stops. He sits on his chair, his jaws contracted, and looks at all of us, with a deep, almost annoyed, penetrating eye. There is a sense of oppression, of thick clouds gathering, a palpable mute tension. Professor Andreotti finally open his mouth and utters the following words, in a strong Tuscan accent\n(\nhow strange it sounded in that momentous event\n)\n: \"Let me tell you one thing. Mathematics is hard, very hard. I worked all my life to understand it, and it is still hard. Each day. You must be prepared to work just as hard, or you better not waste your time, better go out and work in the fields\". Then he pauses, an unfathomable pain engraved in his face, he toils with something on the desk, perhaps a cheap packet of cigarettes: \"The lesson is over\".\nAndreotti was awarded an honorary degree by the University of Nice. He was elected as a corresponding member of the\nAccademia Nazionale dei Lincei\nin\n1968\n, awarded their Feltrinelli Prize in\n1971\n, and became a full member in\n1979\n. Almost certainly he would have received further awards but, sadly, he died at the young age of\n55\n. He was buried in the church of San Francesco in Pisa. His friends and colleagues contributed the paper\n[\n7\n]\nas a tribute:-\n... we lost a good friend and a remarkable mathematician. For more than\n13\nyears Andreotti has been a member of the Editorial Board of 'Compositio Matematica'. We shall remember his warm friendship, his fine personality and his mathematical ability.\nHis wife, Barbara, died on\n14\nDecember\n2008\nin her home in Pisa, after a prolonged illness:-\nShe was known for her vast and international network of friends. An accomplished pianist, singer and teacher, avid traveller, lover of languages and literature, and generous friend, she leaves the cherished memory of a personality, sparkling with warmth and intelligence, and a life lived richly and fully, to all who knew and loved her.",
