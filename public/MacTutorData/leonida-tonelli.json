  "biografia": "Leonida Tonelli\n's family were Venetian. He spent his childhood in a number of different Italian cities, living most of the time in Gemona, Pavia and Pesaro. He completed his schooling in Pesaro, where he undertook technical studies, and then entered the University of Bologna in\n1902\nat the age of seventeen. His lecturers at Bologna included\nSalvatore Pincherle\n, who taught him analysis,\nFederigo Enriques\n, who taught him projective and descriptive geometry, and\nCesare Arzelà\nwho taught function theory. Tonelli caught a serious infection while on an excursion to the mountains south of Bologna and this meant that he could not study for some considerable time. His university studies, as a consequence, took longer than might be expected.\nCesare Arzelà\n(1847\n-\n1912)\n, who had studied in Pisa with\nUlisse Dini\nand\nEnrico Betti\n, was Tonelli's thesis advisor at Bologna. Tonelli was awarded a doctorate in\n1907\nfor his thesis\nI polinomi di approssimazione di Tchébychev\nⓉ\n(\nThe polynomial approximations of Tchebychev\n)\n. This work on\nChebyshev\npolynomials was published in a\n72\n-page paper in the\nAnnali di Matematica pura e applicata\nin\n1908\n. This was not his first publication for\nSulle funzioni derivate\nⓉ\n(\nOn derived functions\n)\nwas published in\n1907\n, with\nSulla rettificazione delle curve\nⓉ\n(\nOn the rectification of curves\n)\n(1908)\nand\nDiscontinuità di\n1\na specie e gruppi di punti\nⓉ\n(\nDiscontinuity of the first kind and groups of points\n)\n(1908)\nappearing in the following year. After the award of his doctorate, Tonelli was appointed as\nSalvatore Pincherle\n's assistant at Bologna to work in algebra and analytic geometry. This arrangement had been made while Tonelli was still an undergraduate, much to the disappointment of\nArzelà\nwho had been very keen to have Tonelli as his own assistant. The tension between\nPincherle\nand Arzelà was a rather sad situation particularly when, after a few years,\nArzelà\nbecame ill and could not give all his courses. He asked for an assistant to help him with his teaching duties but\nPincherle\nrefused to let Tonelli take on the role for he wanted to retain his collaboration. As a result, Tonelli ended up teaching three courses along with the corresponding exercise classes. Despite this heavy teaching load, Tonelli's mathematical research became deeper and wider and in\n1910\nhe qualified as a lecturer in Infinitesimal Analysis. He published two major papers in\n1910\n, namely\nSull'iterazione\nⓉ\n(\nIteration\n)\nand\nSulla rappresentazione analitica delle funzione di più variabili reali\nⓉ\n(\nOn the representation of analytic functions of several variables\n)\n.\nA competition for the Chair of Infinitesimal Analysis at the University of Parma was announced and Tonelli took part. He was the unanimous winner of the competition in\n1911\nbut problems arose which prevented the appointment being made. First\nArzelà\nbecame ill and then, in March\n1912\n, he died. The final decision was taken by the Board of Governors at its meeting in June\n1913\nwhen they decided to cancel the competition. However, despite not being appointed to the chair in Parma after winning the competition, Tonelli soon was competing for another chair, this time the Chair of Algebraic Analysis at University of Cagliari. Again he was placed first and, on\n16\nOctober\n1913\n, took up the Chair at the University of Cagliari.\nTonelli had a chair but he was not entirely happy. He had two problems, one being that he was not too happy to be in Sardinia and would much prefer to be on the Italian mainland, the other being that he would much rather have a Chair of Infinitesimal Analysis to a Chair of Algebraic Analysis. He therefore took part in the new competition for the Chair of Infinitesimal Analysis at the University of Parma and again was successful. He took up his chair in Parma in\n1914\n, at about the time that World War I was beginning in Europe.\nAt first Italy kept out of the war and, while much of Europe became fought, Tonelli taught courses in rational mechanics at Parma. However, in May\n1915\nItaly entered the war, declaring war on Austria-Hungary. However, their offensive was not successful and the Austrians began a counter-offensive in March\n1916\n. Later that year Tonelli decided to volunteer for war service. He served in the artillery in the Seventh Army, fighting with great bravery in the mountains in Macedonia near the town of Monastir\n(\nnow called Bitola\n)\nwhere he contracted malaria. Subsequently Tonelli was with the Seventh Army when it held the front from the Stelvio Pass to Lake Garda, and on the morning of\n4\nNovember\n1918\nwhen the Italian flag was raised at Mezzolombardo. With the end of the war, the rector of the University of Parma requested that Tonelli might he allowed to return to take up his university duties. He received many decorations for his bravery during the fighting. In addition to the Croce al Merito di Guerra\n(\nWar Merit Cross\n)\nand the bronze Medaglia Al Valore Militare\n(\nMilitary Medal for Valour\n)\nfor bravery in the military action at Mezzolombardo, he also received two Commendations and two Promotions of War Merit. The artillery commander of the Seventh Army described Tonelli as follows\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nAn officer of truly exceptional quality, capable of carrying out any assignment with skill, alertness and decision, he was one of the most intelligent performers under my command. He is also a brave soldier, who worthily honoured his chair.\nAs one would expect, Tonelli has no publications appearing in\n1917\nor\n1918\n, but by\n1919\nhe had returned to his remarkably regular output of quality papers. He had taken up again the duties of his chair at Parma in\n1918\nbut in the spring of\n1922\nhe was called to the Chair of Higher Analysis at the University of Bologna. There he taught analysis courses, alternating his teaching with that of\nPincherle\nuntil\nPincherle\nretired in the autumn of\n1928\n. On his retirement, Tonelli was appointed to his Chair of Infinitesimal Analysis.\nAround this time Tonelli received many honours recognising the high quality of his research contributions. He received the Gold Medal from the\nNational Academy of Sciences of Italy\n(\nthe \"Academy of Forty\"\n)\n, and in\n1927\nthe\nAccademia dei Lincei\nawarded him their Grand Prize for his mathematical achievements in\n1925\n. Over these years his publication record is truly remarkable with eight papers appearing in\n1925\n, including important ones on the calculus of variations, and eleven papers in\n1926\n. He was an invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Toronto in August\n1924\n, giving the lecture\nSul calcolo delle variazioni\nⓉ\n(\nOn the calculus of variations\n)\n. Four years later, he was a plenary speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians held in Bologna in September\n1928\n, giving the lecture\nIl contributo italiano alla teoria delle funzioni di variabili reali\nⓉ\n(\nThe Italian contribution to the theory of real variables\n)\n. In addition to his plenary talk, he also gave the lecture\nSulla semicontinuità degli integrali doppi\nⓉ\n(\nOn the semicontinuity of double integrals\n)\nat the Congress. Again, at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Zürich in\n1932\n, he gave the invited lecture\nSul calcolo delle variazioni\nⓉ\n(\nOn the calculus of variations\n)\n.\nAs well as producing deep research, Tonelli was also involved in teaching Analysis courses at the University of Ferrara up to\n1927\n, and later, at Bologna, he taught mathematics course for students of Chemistry and the Life Sciences. However, the School of Mathematics at the University of Pisa was going through hard times and they looked for an outstanding mathematician to revive its fortunes. They offered Tonelli the Chair which he accepted in\n1930\n. He remained at Pisa for the rest of his career, although during the years of\n1939\n-\n42\nhe was officially transferred to the University of Rome. However, he did not spend time in Rome, treating the appointment as only nominal. The Department of Mathematics at the University of Pisa is now named for Leonida Tonelli. The Department's web page explains Tonelli's influence:-\nTonelli taught in Pisa for many years. After his premature death in\n1946\n, it fell to his students to carry forward his demanding heredity during the extremely difficult years following the end of the Second World War. One of these,\nAlessandro Faedo\n, for many years rector of the University of Pisa, was largely responsible for the subsequent flowering of Pisan mathematics. It began with his bringing to Pisa\nFederico Cafiero\n, a student of\nRenato Caccioppoli\n, and reached its peak in the\n1960\n's with the arrival of\nAldo Andreotti\n,\nJacopo Barsotti\n,\nEnrico Bombieri\n, Sergio Campanato, Gianfranco Capriz,\nEnnio De Giorgi\n,\nGiovanni Prodi\n,\nGuido Stampacchia\n, and Edoardo Vesentini. The mathematicians that now constitute the faculty of the Department Leonida Tonelli are, in large part, the progeny of these outstanding mathematicians.\nHis\n1940\npaper\nL'analisi funzionale nel calcolo delle variazioni\nⓉ\n(\nFunctional analysis in the calculus of variations\n)\nis interesting in that it gives an insight into Tonelli's thinking on one of the topics for which he is most famed, namely the calculus of variations. H H Goldstine writes:-\nThis paper is an exposition of the reasons that led the author to develop his approach to the calculus of variations and of the results obtained by himself and others. He discusses at some length the classical calculus of variations before showing how the functional calculus was brought to bear on the calculus of variations by means of the concept of semi-continuity. Some of the more important results of his work are mentioned in passing, and the essay closes with a few remarks on extensions of the calculus of variations to abstract spaces.\nThe interesting paper\nSu alcuni concetti dell'analisi moderna\nⓉ\n(\nOn some modern analysis concepts\n)\n(1942)\nis,\nTibor Radó\nwrites:-\n... concerned with the concepts of bounded variation and absolute continuity for functions of one variable and functions of several variables, with particular emphasis upon the work of Italian mathematicians.\nWe have already mentioned the remarkable number and quality of Tonelli's papers. He published\n137\npapers, all single authored except one in\n1915\nwritten in collaboration with\nGuido Fubini\n, and a number of important books including\nFondamenti di calcolo delle variazioni\nⓉ\n(\nFoundations of calculus of variations\n)\n(2\nvolumes\n)\n(1921\n,\n1923)\n,\nSerie trigonometriche\nⓉ\n(\nTrigonometric series\n)\n(1928)\n, and\n(\nwith E Lindner\n)\nCorso di matematica per la Scuola media\nⓉ\n(\nMathematics for middle schools\n)\n(3\nvolumes\n)\n(1941\n,\n1942)\n. His large number of publications meant that it was decided to produce four volumes of\nSelected Works\n. The first volume\nFunzioni di variabile reale\nⓉ\n(\nThe real variable\n)\n, published in\n1960\n, contains\n46\npapers on the theory of functions of a real variable. The second volume\nCalcolo delle variazioni\nⓉ\n(\nCalculus of variations\n)\n, published in\n1961\n, contains\n27\narticles, namely, all those dealing with the calculus of variations which appeared between\n1911\nand\n1924\n. The third volume\nCalcolo delle variazioni\nⓉ\n(\nCalculus of variations\n)\n, published in\n1962\n, contains all papers on the calculus of variations that appeared after\n1926\n, including a posthumous paper of\n1950\n. The fourth, and final, volume\nArgomenti vari\nⓉ\n(\nVarious topics\n)\n, published in\n1963\n, contains papers on trigonometric series, ordinary differential equations and\nintegral equations\n(\nall published in or after\n1924\n-\n25)\n, and some miscellaneous work\n(\nfrom\n1909\nonwards\n)\n, including Tonelli's biography of\nSalvatore Pincherle\n.\nTonelli died at the age of\n60\nin\n1946\n. He was buried alongside\nUlisse Dini\nand\nLuigi Bianchi\nin the Monumental Cemetery in Pisa.",
