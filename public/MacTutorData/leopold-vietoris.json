  "summary": "Leopold Vietoris was a long-lived Austrian mathematician best known for his contributions to topology, especially the Mayer-Vietoris sequence. He was also interested in mathematical history.",
  "biografia": "Perhaps the first thing to note is that there is no error in the dates of birth and death that we give above.\nLeopold Vietoris\nreally did live to just short of his\n111\nth\nbirthday. His parents were Hugo Vietoris, a railway engineer, and Anna Diller. Later in his life Hugo Vietoris became head of planning in the city of Vienna and was involved in the construction of bridges in\n1913\n-\n15\n. When Leopold was six years old he began his elementary school education in Vienna. He entered the elementary school in the autumn of\n1897\nand he studied there until July\n1902\n. At this school he had his first introduction to mathematics when he learnt the basic operations of arithmetic.\nVietoris's secondary education was from\n1902\nto\n1910\nat the Benedictine\nGymnasium\nin Melk. He received a good mathematical education at this Gymnasium but at this time he was following his father's wishes and aiming for a career in engineering. In fact when he entered the Technical University in Vienna in\n1910\nit was still with the intention of becoming an engineer. However, he quickly decided that he wanted to become a mathematician and even as soon as Christmas\n1910\nhe was making efforts to study mathematics and descriptive geometry. He received excellent teaching in mathematics from Hermann Rothe, in descriptive geometry from Emil Müller, and in projective geometry from Theodor Schmid. He was particularly inspired by the lectures in projective geometry which gave him a life-long love for the topic. From the academic year\n1911\n-\n12\nhe took courses at the University of Vienna in addition to courses at the Technical University. His lecturers at the University of Vienna included Gustav von Escherich\n(1849\n-\n1935)\n,\nWilhelm Wirtinger\n,\nPhilipp Furtwängler\n, Gustav Kohn\n(1859\n-\n1921)\n, Wilhelm Gross\n(1886\n-\n1918)\n, and the philosopher Adolf Stöhr\n(1855\n-\n1921)\n.\nIt was in\n1912\nthat Vietoris heard a lecture by Wilhelm Gross on topology. Gross had been a student of\nWirtinger\nat Vienna, then a postdoctoral student at Göttingen before returning to Vienna as a\nPrivatdocent\n. In this lecture Gross described his own work extending ideas by\nFrigyes Riesz\nwho had defined the concept of a mathematical continuum as an abstract set provided with a notion of an accumulation point. Gross described a system of axioms defining the notions of neighbourhood and of accumulation point, three of these axioms being due to\nFrigyes Riesz\nand the fourth due to himself. Around the same time, Vietoris had attended lectures by Hermann Rothe at the Technical University where he had introduced the notion of a manifold. This gave Vietoris the idea of using a topological approach to create a geometrical notion of a manifold. He was working on these ideas, advised by Gustav von Escherich and\nWilhelm Wirtinger\n, when World War I broke out. Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia on\n28\nJuly\n1914\nand Vietoris volunteered for service in the army in August\n1914\n. In the following month he was badly wounded and, for a considerable time, he was unable to take part in the war as he was recovering from these wounds. After his recovery he was sent to the Italian front. Italy had joined the war on\n23\nMay\n1915\nwhen they declared war on Austria-Hungary. The Austrians held the mountains and Italy, although holding numerical superiority, found difficulty attacking the Austrians in the mountainous terrain. Vietoris, who loved the mountains, was given the task of acting as an army mountain guide. Despite the very difficult conditions of war, Vietoris was still able to think about his research problems and it was in\n1916\n, while being a mountain guide, that he made a significant advance. Despite the wartime conditions, he was able to publish his first paper, namely\nEine besondere Erzeugungsweise der Raumkurven vierter Ordnung zweiter Art\nⓉ\n(\nA special production of the space curves of the fourth order of the second kind\n)\n(1916)\n. He was able to return to Vienna for the spring semester of\n1918\nand during these three months he made more progress with his research and also was able to read\nFelix Hausdorff\n's\nGrundzüge der Mengenlehre\nⓉ\n(\nBasics of Set Theory\n)\nwhich had been published in\n1914\n. In October\n1918\nthe Austro-Hungarians were decisively defeated at the Vittorio Veneto and, on\n4\nNovember, Vietoris was captured by the Italians. Although hostilities ended shortly after this, Vietoris was held in captivity by the Italians until\n7\nAugust\n1919\n.\nAlthough Vietoris was held prisoner for nine months, he was well treated and during these months he was able to complete writing his doctoral thesis. On being released and returning to Vienna, he qualified as a Gymnasium teacher of mathematics and descriptive geometry in October\n1919\n, and submitted his thesis\nStetige Mengen\nⓉ\n(\nConstant amounts\n)\nto the University of Vienna in December\n1919\n. He was awarded his doctorate in July\n1920\nand his thesis, published in the\nMonatshefte für Mathematik\nin\n1921\n, is considered by many as his most significant contribution. Having qualified as a Gymnasium teacher, Vietoris took up a teaching position in\n1919\n. Soon, however, he received a postcard from Gustav von Escherich congratulating him on his outstanding thesis and offering him the position of Assistant Professor at the Technical University Graz. Vietoris accepted and began teaching there in\n1920\n. At Graz he was an assistant to Roland Weitzenböck who was an ordinary professor in number theory and the theory of invariants.\nIn\n1922\nVietoris moved to the University of Vienna where he\nhabilitated\nin the following year. He had written several papers which were published in\n1922\nand\n1923\n, two of which are\nBereiche zweiter Ordnung\nⓉ\n(\nAreas of the second order\n)\n(1922)\nand\nKontinua zweiter Ordnung\nⓉ\n(\nSecond-order continua\n)\n(1923)\n. The first of these he had submitted as his habilitation thesis. His habilitation was recommended by\nHans Hahn\n. In the\n1923\npaper he writes:-\nThis work is a continuation of my research on the foundations of topology: \"Stetige Mengen\", Monatsh. f. Math. Phys.\n31\n(1921)\nand \"Kontinua zweiter Ordnung\", Monatsh. f. Math. Phys.\n32\n(1922)\n.\nAlso in\n1922\nand\n1923\nhis papers\nÜber Extrema mit Nebenbedingungen\nⓉ\n(\nOn minima with constraints\n)\n(1922)\n,\nDas stetige Deformieren topologischer Gebilde vom Standpunkt der Mengenlehre\nⓉ\n(\nThe constant deforming topological structure from the standpoint of set theory\n)\n(1923)\nand\nZur Geometrie ebener Massenanziehungsprobleme\nⓉ\n(\nOn the geometry of plane gravitation problems\n)\n(1923)\nwere published. The authors of\n[\n3\n]\nwrite:-\nThe\n1920\ns were a heady decade for topologists, and Vienna was as good a place to be as any, with\nHahn\n,\nMenger\n,\nReidemeister\n, and later\nHurewicz\nand Nöbeling around. In the general commotion many ideas emerged independently and almost simultaneously in several places. Vietoris, who always was an extremely modest person, never engaged in priority debates\n(\nquite in contrast, for instance, to his young and fiery colleague\nKarl Menger\n)\n. But Vietoris was the first to introduce filters\n(\nwhich he called \"wreaths\"\n)\nand one of the first to define compact spaces\n(\nwhich he called \"lückenlos\"\n)\n, using the condition that every filter has a cluster point. He also introduced the notion of regularity, and proved that\n(\nin modern parlance\n)\ncompact spaces are normal.\nIn\n1925\nVietoris spent three semesters in Amsterdam having been awarded a Rockefeller fellowship. There he participated in a seminar led by\nL E J Brouwer\nbut also had\nPavel Sergeevich Aleksandrov\n,\nKarl Menger\n,\nDavid van Dantzig\nand\nWitold Hurewicz\nas participants. Influenced by the algebraic ideas that were being discussed in this seminar, Vietoris began to undertake research in algebraic topology. Back in Vienna he began giving lectures on homology groups and cohomology groups which are algebraic invariants of topological spaces. Walther Mayer\n(1887\n-\n1948)\nhad been appointed to the University of Vienna as a privatdocent in\n1926\n. He attended Vietoris's lectures and, in particular, tried to solve some conjectures that Vietoris had described. Vietoris had suggested how a proof of these conjectures might be found and Mayer solved a special case in\n1929\nwhich he published in\nÜber abstrakte Topologie\nⓉ\n(\nOn abstract topology\n)\n(1929)\n. In this paper Mayer writes:-\nI was introduced to topology by my colleague Vietoris, whose lectures I attended in\n1926\n-\n7\nat the local university. In many talks about this area Vietoris gave me many hints for which I am very grateful.\nVietoris then completed the proof of the full result for homology groups in\n1930\nwhich he published in\nÜber die Homologiegruppen der Vereinigung zweier Komplexe\nⓉ\n(\nOn the homology groups of the union of two complexes\n)\n(1930)\n. He wrote in this paper:-\nW Mayer, whom I told about the problem as well as the conjectured result and a way to its solution, has solved the question, as far as it concerns\nBetti\nnumbers, in a somewhat different way in these 'Monatshefte'. In what follows, I will return to my original idea and use it for the solution in the general case.\nToday this result is known as the Mayer-Vietoris sequence. It provides an important method to split the computation of homology groups and\ncohomology groups\nof a topological space into a computation of these groups for subspaces of the topological space.\nIn\n1927\nVietoris left Vienna to take up a position as associate professor at the University of Innsbruck. He was very pleased to leave the hectic life in Vienna to be close to the High Alps that he loved in Innsbruck. However, after a year he returned to Vienna becoming a full Professor at the Vienna University of Technology. In the autumn of that year he married Klara Anna Maria Riccabona von Reichenfels\n(1904\n-\n1935)\n, the daughter of Rudolf Riccabona von Reichenfels and his wife Maria Burlo von Ehrwall. Two years later, in\n1930\n, he returned to the University of Innsbruck as a full professor and he remained there for the rest of his career. Let us note here that Klara died in\n1935\nduring the birth of their sixth child\n(\nall six were daughters\n)\n. In the following year, Vietoris married her sister, Maria Josefa Vincentia Riccabona von Reichenfels\n(1901\n-\n2002)\n.\nBack in Innsbruck, Vietoris was drawn to the mountains that he loved so much. However, he combined pleasure with scientific work\n[\n3\n]\n:-\nVietoris became involved with the local school of glaciologists led by the distinguished Finsterwalder. In the role of a Gletscherknecht, he carried the heavy instruments for geological measurements and set up experiments in countless scientific alpine excursions. In due time, Vietoris started publishing himself on the blockstream of the Hochebenkar, a glacier-like formation of rock débris pasted together by ice, which he had come to know like no one else. He also wrote on how to use the compass as an alpinist\n(\nrather than a sailor\n)\n, on \"geometry in the service of the mountaineer,\" and on the physics of skiing, and he held patent no.\n100832\nfor a method of using air photographs in cartography.\nGermany annexed Austria in March\n1938\nso, when they invaded Poland in September\n1939\nleading to countries declaring war on Germany, Austria was again at war. Vietoris again volunteered for service as he had done in World War I, but by now he was\n48\nyears old. He was immediately sent to Poland and, as he had been in World War I, he was wounded. He continued to serve in the military until June\n1941\nwhen he reached the age of\n50\n. At this stage he was allowed to leave military service and resume his duties at the University of Innsbruck.\nEven before World War II, Vietoris had begun to undertake research in areas different from his initial work on\nalgebraic topology\n. For example he published\nÜber die Integration gewöhnlicher Differentialgleichungen durch Iteration\nⓉ\n(\nThe integration of ordinary differential equations through iteration\n)\n(\nPart\n1\n,\n1932\n; Part\n2\n,\n1934\n; Part\n3\n,\n1939)\n. During World War II he published\nZur Theorie der Integraphen\nⓉ\n(\nOn the theory of the integrator\n)\n(1942)\nwhich was reviewed by William Edward Milne who writes:-\nThe author makes a harmonic analysis of the difference between the true curve and the curve actually followed by the tracing point of the instrument and, after adopting suitable assumptions, concludes that the resulting error is \"practically nil.\"\nHe wrote further on this topic after the war. Another of his papers published during the war was\nZur Kennzeichnung des Sinus und verwandter Funktionen durch Funktionalgleichungen\nⓉ\n(\nIdentification of the sine and related functions by functional equations\n)\n(1944)\nin which he developed a method to introduce the sine by a functional equation. After the war he worked on a number of different areas including statistics, publishing a series of four papers entitled\nVergleich unbekannter Mittelwerte auf Grund von Versuchsreihen\nⓉ\n(\nComparison of unknown mean values based on a series of experiments\n)\nbetween\n1979\nand\n1982\n. He continued to publish papers, his last paper being the third in a series entitled\nÜber das Vorzeichen gewisser trigonometrischer Summen\nⓉ\n(\nOn the sign of certain trigonometric sums\n)\n(1994)\nwhich appeared when he was\n103\nyears old.\nFor his outstanding achievements Vietoris received many awards. He was elected a corresponding member of the\nAustrian Academy of Sciences\nin\n1935\nand a full member in\n1960\n. He received honorary doctorates from the Technical University of Vienna\n(1984)\nand the University of Innsbruck\n(1994)\n. These were for his work:-\n... on orientation in mountainous terrain by differential geometric means, the strength of the alpine ski, and the physics of block glaciers.\nHe received the Austrian Cross of Honour for Science and Art\n(1973)\n, the Grand Gold Decoration of Honour for Services to the Republic of Austria\n(1981)\n, the Gold Medal of the Austrian Mathematical Society\n(1981)\n, and the Order of Merit of the city of Innsbruck\n(1982)\n. Vietoris was elected an honorary member of the\nAustrian Mathematical Society\nin\n1965\nand of the\nGerman Mathematical Society\nin\n1992\n.\nLet us end this biography by quoting Heinrich Reitberger's summary of Vietoris's contributions\n[\n11\n]\n:-\nLeopold Vietoris's fundamental contributions to general as well as algebraic topology, and also to other branches of the mathematical sciences, have made him immortal in the world of science. As a person, he was outstandingly humble and grateful for his well-being, which he also wished and granted his fellow humans. He devoted his spare time to his large family, religious meditation, music, and his beloved mountains. On the other hand, administrative duties were not Vietoris's favorite tasks, as he pointed out in a letter to\nL E J Brouwer\nin\n1947\n: \"As dean I am overwhelmed with administrative matters to such an extent that I often have to hold my lectures inadequately prepared and don't have any time for scientific research. Luckily, the term will soon be over and then I hope to be a scientist again and not a bureaucrat.\" In research Vietoris was a \"lone fighter\": Only one of his more than seventy mathematical papers has a coauthor. Half of the papers were written after his sixtieth birthday.",
