  "biografia": "Irving Stringham\n's parents were Henry Stringham\n(1801\n-\n1880)\nand Eliza Tomlinson\n(1802\n-\n1881)\n. Henry and Eliza Stringham were married on\n7\nMarch\n1823\nin Brookfield, Brookfield County, Connecticut, and they had nine children: Amelia Maria Stringham\n(\nborn\n9\nApr\n1824\n, Fairport, Monroe County, New York\n)\n; Thomas Henry Stringham\n(\nborn\n29\nMar\n1826\n, Rochester, Monroe County, New York\n)\n; Ann Eliza Stringham\n(\nborn\n26\nApr\n1828\n, Dansville, Livingston County, New York\n)\n; Daniel Tomlinson Stringham\n(\nborn\n2\nNov\n1830\n, Geneseo, Livingston County, New York\n)\n; Cecelia Jane Stringham\n(\nborn\n5\nNov\n1832\n, Franklinville, Cattaraugus, New York\n)\n; Charles Augustus Stringham\n(\nborn\n22\nJan\n1835\n, Lynden, Cattaraugus, New York\n)\n; Theodore Lefoy Stringham\n(\nborn\n2\nFeb\n1839\n, Lynden, Cattaraugus, New York\n)\n; Oliver Eugene Stringham\n(\nborn\n31\nJan\n1844\n, Lynden, Cattaraugus, New York\n)\n; and Washington Irving Stringham, the subject of this biography\n(\nborn\n10\nDec\n1847\n, Delevan, Cattaraugus, New York\n)\n. Two of Irving Stringham's brothers served in the Northern army during the American Civil War. Oliver Eugene Stringham was one of the two brothers and he was taken prisoner at the Battle of Gettysburg. Although he was released in\n1865\nhe died seven years later as a result of his time in prison.\nStringham was brought up at Yorkshire Centre, in western New York, where he attended the village school. When he was twelve years old he became a member of the Methodist Episcopal Church but eventually he decided that none of the recognised churches fitted his beliefs. In the spring of\n1865\n, after the American Civil War had ended, he moved to Topeka, Kansas, to join one of his brothers and one of his sisters who were living there. He studied for a short while at Topeka High School in\n1866\nand then, in the same year, began his studies at the preparatory department of Lincoln College in Topeka. Lincoln College was a very new establishment, founded only one year earlier in\n1865\n. After a large donation to the College by Ichabod Washburn, the College changed its name to Washburn College in\n1868\n. He spent a year\n1866\n-\n67\nin the preparatory department and showed great promise, being awarded a prize for the best performance in 'Scientific studies'. Although he gained admission to the first year to begin his studies in the autumn of\n1867\n, he delayed his entry for a year and began his studies in the autumn of\n1868\n. He completed one year of study but, not having the necessary financial support to continue, he worked as a house and sign painter for three years,\n1869\n-\n1872\n.\nIn\n1872\n, Stringham entered the second year of studies at Washburn College\n(\nas it was named by this time\n)\n. He studied there for a year but continued to support himself by working as a bookkeeper and clerk in a drug store run by his brother. However, Stringham now aimed higher and was intent on studying at Harvard College. During the year\n1872\n-\n73\nhe applied for admission to Harvard and, despite his unusual educational background, he was accepted. He began his studies at Harvard in September\n1873\nand lived at\n43\nCollege House with Richard Smith Culbreth who became a lawyer. In his final three years he lived at\n25\nStoughton with James Byrne who also became a lawyer. During his undergraduate years, Stringham was a member of the Everett Athenaeum, a short-lived society for second year students with literary interests. He was also a member of the Signet Society which was founded around\n1870\nfor those \"of merit and character\", and a member of Phi Beta Kappa. The:-\n...  purpose of Phi Beta Kappa is to recognize and encourage scholarship, friendship, and cultural interests.\nStringham received honours in mathematics in his second year at Harvard College and earned the highest honours in mathematics when he graduated with an A.B. in\n1877\n. He had submitted his thesis\nInvestigations in Quaternions.\nI\n. Logarithms of Quaternions.\nII\n. Applications of Quaternion Analysis to Rectification of Curves. Quadrature of Surfaces, and Cubature of Solids\nfor mathematical honours with the A.B. This thesis was presented by\nBenjamin Peirce\nfor publication in the\nProceedings of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences\nand it appeared in Volume\n13\nas a\n31\n-page paper.\nAfter graduating from Harvard College, Stringham was a graduate student at Johns Hopkins University in\n1877\n-\n78\nwhere he worked towards his doctorate. In his application to the Mathematics Department, he had indicated that in addition to mathematics he wished:-\n... as far as possible, to pursue the study of Fine Arts.\nHe was an assistant on the\nAmerican Journal of Mathematics\nin\n1878\n-\n79\nand he was appointed as a fellow in mathematics at Johns Hopkins in\n1878\n. He published the paper\nThe Quaternion Formulae for Quantification of Curves, Surfaces and Solids, and for Barycentres\nin\n1879\n. This paper continued the work of his A.B. thesis. Also in\n1879\nhe published the note\nSome General Formulae for Integrals of Irrational Functions\nin the\nAmerican Journal of Mathematics\n.\nAt Johns Hopkins, he took part in the Mathematical Seminary where he delivered the lecture\nOn Vector Ratios considered as Trigonometric Functions of Angles\non\n22\nDecember\n1879\n. He delivered the lecture\nA Generalization, for\nn\nn\nn\n-fold Space, of Euler's Equation for Polyhedra\non\n21\nJanuary\n1880\n. He attended the following courses in\n1879\n-\n80\n: '\nElliptic Functions\n' by\nW Story\n, 'Higher Plane Curves' by\nW Story\n, 'Calculus of Variations' by\nT Craig\n, 'Spherical Harmonics' by\nT Craig\n, 'Symbolic Logic' by\nC S Peirce\n, 'Quaternions' by\nW Story\n, and 'Theory of Numbers' by\nJ J Sylvester\n. At the Johns Hopkins Scientific Association on\n7\nJanuary\n1880\n, he presented paper on\nGeometrical Figures in Space of Four Dimensions\n. He began with the following:-\nA regular figure in space of four dimensions is defined as one which is completely bounded by equal regular figures of three dimensions and whose vertices lie on the four-fold sphere. Three of such figures are,\n(1)\nthe Four-fold Pentoid, bounded by five tetrahedra,\n(2)\nthe Four-fold Octoid, bounded by eight cubes,\n(3)\nthe Four-fold Hexadekoid, bounded by sixteen tetrahedra.\nOn\n17\nMarch he delivered the talk\nOn Rotation in Four-dimensional Space\nto the Mathematical Seminary which began with the following definition:-\nThe rotation of a particle, or point, about a plane in four-dimensional space may be defined as such a motion of the particle that a radius vector drawn from a fixed point in the plane to the particle shall always remain constant in length and perpendicular to the plane.\nHe also addressed the Metaphysical Club on\n8\nMarch\n1880\ngiving a resumé of\nErnst Schröder\n's\nOperationskreis des Logikkalkuls\n. Stringham said:-\nThe main features of\nSchröder\n's system are,\n(1)\nits dualistic arrangement, by which to every addition equation a multiplication equation is made to correspond\n(\nand visa versa\n)\n,\n(2)\nthe transformation of every logical equation into a form in which the right hand member is zero, and\n(3)\nmore especially his announcement of a Haupttheorem by means of which by a single operation two equations are obtained, from one of which any given class symbol is eliminated, while the other gives its value. The method of\n(2)\nis identical with that of\nJevons\n.\nIt is interesting to see in what high esteem Stringham was held. For example,\nJ J Sylvester\n, in his paper\nOn a Geometrical Proof of a Theorem in Numbers\ndelivered to the Mathematical Seminary in January\n1882\n, said:-\nThose gifted with the powers of a Stringham, a\nNewcomb\n, or a\nCharles S Peirce\nto feel their way about in supersensible space, may, in like manner, obtain if not an intuitive, at least immediate, or non-mediated proof of the\n[\nfollowing\n]\ntheorem ...\nStringham was awarded a Ph.D. in\n1880\nfor his theses\nRegular Figures in\nn\n−\nn-\nn\n−\ndimensional Space\n. In the same year he was awarded a Parker Fellowship by Harvard and, funded by this, he went to Europe. In particular he spent time at Leipzig where he attended lectures by\nFelix Klein\n. He wrote in letters back to Daniel Coit Gilman, the president of Johns Hopkins, about attending weekly seminars:-\n... with Professor\nKlein\n's wonderful critical faculty continually at play.\nAlthough most of the students at the seminar were German, there were, he wrote:-\n... one Englishman, one Frenchman, one Italian, and one American\n(\nmyself\n)\n.\nKlein\nlectured for two semesters on geometric function theory, in particular giving\nRiemann\n's theory of algebraic functions. Stringham gave two lectures in\nKlein\n's seminar on the work he had done for his Ph.D. thesis. Discussion with\nKlein\nled to Stringham's paper\nDetermination of the Finite Quaternion Groups\nwhich was published in the\nAmerican Journal of Mathematics\nin\n1881\n. Stringham submitted the paper from Schwarzbach, Saxony, in September,\n1881\n.\nAfter spending the two academic years\n1880\n-\n82\nin Europe, Stringham would have liked to have remained for another year. He tried to get either Johns Hopkins or Harvard to award him a position which would allow him to spend another year in Europe but he was not successful. Gilman did not come up with a job at Johns Hopkins but, instead, arranged for Stringham to get a professorship at the University of California at Berkeley. He took up this position in the autumn of\n1882\nbut not only was he a professor but he was also appointed as Head of Mathematics, a post that had been vacant for over a year. On\n28\nJune\n1888\n, Stringham married Martha Sherman Day in New Haven, Connecticut. Martha, born in San Leandro, Stockton, California in\n1861\n, was the daughter of Roger Sherman Day and Harriet Eliza Clark. Martha and Irving Stringham had three children: Harriet Day Stringham\n(\nborn\n21\nAugust\n1889)\n; Martha Sherman Stringham\n(\nborn\n5\nMarch\n1891)\n; and Roland Irving Stringham\n(\nborn\n24\nMay\n1892)\n. Stringham made several trips abroad, both before and after his marriage. For example he studied in Spain in\n1887\nand in Paris on several occasions between\n1889\nand\n1900\n.\nWhen Stringham was appointed as a professor and head of mathematics at the University of California at Berkeley he was\n35\nyears old. It was a role he took on reluctantly, however, since he fully realised that his opportunities as a research mathematician would be limited. Indeed, he was soon appointed as Dean of the Faculty giving him an even greater administrative role. As an example we quote from a letter he wrote in\n1884\n, two years after his appointment to Berkeley, to Daniel Coit Gilman, the president of Johns Hopkins. The University of California was governed by a Board of Regents made up of industrialists and politicians. Stringham complained to Gilman that the Board of Regents continued to interfere using:-\n... an arbitrary exercise of power in matters concerning which the judgement of the Faculty in Berkeley would certainly be more competent.\nIn the same letter he wrote:-\nI have not be able to apply myself to my favourite studies.\nTony Robbin writes\n[\n4\n]\n:-\nThis wonderful mathematician with so many lively interests was swallowed by the morass that is university politics.\nWe mention two books that Stringham published while at Berkeley, namely\nUniplanar Algebra\n, Vol.\n1\n:\nBeing of a Propaedeutic to the Higher Mathematical Analysis\n(1893)\nand\nElementary Algebra for the Use of Schools and Colleges\nby Charles Smith, revised and adapted to American schools by Irving Stringham\n(1895)\n.\nPrefaces and reviews of these books can be read at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nWe still have not looked at the mathematics for which Stringham was best known. Although today, he is little known among mathematicians, we must point out that in the\n1880\ns he was considered a leading mathematician with great research potential. The results which gave him an international reputation were contained in his doctoral thesis\nRegular Figures in\nn\nn\nn\n-dimensional Space\nand became well-known through the paper he published with the same title. The platonic solids in\n4\n-dimensional space had been found by\nLudwig Schläfli\nin\n1852\n. Stringham's paper\n[\n4\n]\n:-\n... largely duplicated\nSchläfli\n's discoveries,\n[\nbut\n]\nfor the first time, included illustrations of four-dimensional figures. Long forgotten until its rediscovery by art historian Linda Henderson, this paper swept through Europe when it was written and was cited in every important mathematical text on four-dimensional geometry for the next two decades.\nLet us give some extracts from Stringham's paper to illustrate how he describes the four-dimensional figures:-\nA regular angle is defined as one all of whose boundaries of any given number of dimensions are the same in form and magnitude. ... the number of regular\n4\n-fold angles that can be made up of regular polyhedral angles is five. Out of trihedral angles three regular\n4\n-fold angles can be formed, corresponding to the three regular polyhedra which have triangular boundaries. Similarly there is one regular distribution for tetrahedral and one for pentahedral angles. The former consists of a set of six angles corresponding to the faces of the cube, and the latter of twelve angles corresponding to the faces of the dodekahedron. ... A complete\nn\nn\nn\n-fold figure is defined as one which is limited on every hand by complete\n(\nn\n−\n1\n)\n(n - 1)\n(\nn\n−\n1\n)\n-fold figures which are themselves limited by complete\n(\nn\n−\n2\n)\n(n - 2)\n(\nn\n−\n2\n)\n- fold figures, and so on. ... In particular, the\n4\n-fold pentahedroid has\n5\nsummits,\n10\nedges,\n10\ntriangular and\n5\ntetrahedral boundaries. To construct this figure select any one summit of each of four tetrahedra and unite them. Bring the faces, which lie adjacent to each other, two and two into coincidence. There will remain four faces still free; take a fifth tetrahedron, and join each one of its faces to one of these four remaining ones. The resulting, figure will be the complete\n4\n-fold pentahedroid.\nWe refer the reader to\n[\n4\n]\nfor an interesting discussion of Stringham's paper and possible sources for the innovative ideas it contains.\nStringham gave a number of addresses, both to school teachers and to International Mathematical Conferences. For example he addressed the International Mathematical Congress, held in connection with the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago in\n1893\n. This Congress was the model for the series of International Congresses of Mathematicians which began in Zürich in\n1897\n. The title of his talk was\nFormulary for an Introduction to Elliptic Functions\n. In\n1900\nhe addressed the International Congress of Mathematicians in Paris with the talk\nOrthogonal Transformations in Elliptic or Hyperbolic Space\n. Among his addresses to school teachers we mention\nMathematics in Grammar Schools\ndelivered to the Alameda Teachers' Institute in October\n1885\n, and T\nhe Past and Present of Elementary Mathematics\ndelivered to the California Teachers' Association in December\n1891\n.\nYou can read part of this address at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nStringham's death is reported in\n[\n5\n]\n:-\nAs dean of the, faculties of the university, under the new scheme put into operation shortly before the departure of Doctor Wheeler as Roosevelt exchange professor to deliver lectures at the University of Berlin, Professor Stringham was acting president. During the last two weeks Professor Stringham had been confined to his bed at his home at\n2250\nProspect street and Sunday afternoon was removed to the Alpha Bates local sanatorium for an operation. Doctors Moffitt, Burnham and Terry were called in. An incision was made, but the patient grew so weak that the operation was postponed, but the scholar rapidly sank and last night lost consciousness and died at daybreak this morning. Uraemic poisoning was pronounced the direct cause.\nMellen Woodman Haskell\n(1863\n-\n1948)\nwas an undergraduate at Harvard and then undertook research for his doctorate supervised by\nFelix Klein\nat Leipzig and Göttingen. He was awarded his doctorate on\n18\nJune\n1889\nand appointed as an Instructor in Mathematics at Berkeley. He was promoted to assistant professor at Berkeley in June of the following year. This was the first new professorial appointment in mathematics following the appointment of Stringham. He worked closely with Stringham at Berkeley and wrote these words following his death:-\nProfessor Stringham was one of the really distinguished mathematicians in this country, being the foremost authority on the subject of absolute geometry and of the geometry of more than three dimensions. He was also a man of wide influence in all University affairs, being actively concerned with every forward movement the University has made during the twenty-seven years of his service. But, most of all, he was a man of sincere purpose, of high ideals, and of kindly sympathy.",
