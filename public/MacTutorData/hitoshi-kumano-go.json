  "summary": "Hitoshi Kumano-Go was a Japanese mathematician who specialised in partial differential equations.",
  "biografia": "Hitoshi Kumano-Go\nwas educated in the standard way for gifted students in Japan at this time. Before entering university he studied at Taikyu Senior High School, graduating in\n1958\n.\nEntering Osaka University after graduating from high school, Kumano-Go studied mathematics and graduated in\n1958\n. He continued to study at Osaka University for his doctorate. His supervisor was M Nagumo who supervised his work on the singular perturbation of second order\npartial differential equations\n. As is frequently the case, the problem which Kumano-Go studied was to extend work which had been completed earlier by his supervisor.\nIn\n1962\nKumano-Go was appointed as an assistant at Osaka University. He submitted his doctoral dissertation in\n1963\nand received his Ph.D. in September of that year. He continued on the staff at Osaka, being promoted to assistant professor in\n1964\nand to associate professor in\n1967\n.\nDuring these years Kumano-Go published a series of papers which studied the local and global uniqueness of the solutions of the\nCauchy\nproblem for partial differential equations. This work used ideas from earlier contributions to the topic by\nCalderon\nand\nZygmund\n. In two papers Kumano-Go also studied non-uniqueness of solutions of the\nCauchy\nproblem.\nKumano-Go spent the two academic years\n1967\n-\n69\nvisiting the\nCourant\nInstitute of Mathematical Sciences at New York University. These were years of great benefit to Kumano-Go who was able to develop many ideas in conversations with Kurt\nFriedrichs\n,\nPeter Lax\n,\nLouis Nirenberg\nand others. He became involved in founding the theory of pseudo-differential operators and after his return to Osaka he continued to publish important contributions to this topic.\nIn\n1971\nKumano-Go was promoted to full professor. His major treatise on\nPseudo Differential Operators\nwas published in Japanese in\n1974\n. It is\n[\n2\n]\n:-\n... an outstanding contribution to the field of pseudo-differential operators in view of its uniqueness and the wealth of material.\nThe book has been translated into English and appeared, published by MIT Press, in\n1982\n.\nOne other important monograph written by Kumano-Go should be mentioned. This is\nPartial differential equations\nwhich was again written in Japanese and was published in\n1978\n. This is a textbook which in addition to studying partial differential equations provides an introduction to pseudo-differential operators.\nIn addition to his work on pseudo-differential operators, Kumano-Go published a series of papers on the product of\nFourier\nintegral operators. This collaborative work with his colleagues led to results which were applied to\n[\n2\n]\n:-\n... the construction of the fundamental solution of a first order hyperbolic system and the study of the wave front sets of solutions.\nH Tanabe writes in\n[\n2\n]\nabout Kumano-Go mathematical contributions other than those contained in his research:-\nKumano-Go's contributions were not limited to his own personal mathematical achievements. He also trained many young mathematicians of high ability. He was well known for the kindly interest which he took in the careers of young mathematicians. He was always ready to help, encourage and advise them. He looked through all their manuscripts, helping to improve and develop their ideas.\nKumano-Go suffered ill health and was admitted to Osaka Hospital in May\n1981\n. The doctors discovered that he was suffering from a brain tumour from which no cure was possible. At the height of his mathematical contributions at the age of\n46\n, Kumano-Go sadly died.",
