  "summary": "Dionisio Gallarati was an Italian mathematician who worked in algebraic geometry.",
  "biografia": "Dionisio Gallarati\nentered the University of Pisa in\n1941\n. However, this was the time of World War II and he studies were interrupted for two years because of the war. He recommenced his studies after the forced break and received his first degree from the University of Genova\n(\nGenoa\n)\n.\nGallarati undertook research at the l'Instituto Nazionale di Alta Matematica\n(\nThe National Institute of Higher Mathematics\n)\nin Rome. There he was taught by most of the stars of Italian mathematics of this period:\nGiacomo Albanese\n,\nLeonard Roth\n(\nteaching in Rome as a visiting professor from Imperial College, London\n)\n,\nL Tonelli\n,\nE G Togliatti\n,\nBeniamino Segre\n, and\nFrancesco Severi\n.\nGallarati was appointed to the University of Genova in\n1947\nand he remained there until he retired in\n1987\n.\nIn\n[\n1\n]\n,\n33\nof the\n64\npapers which Gallarati published between\n1951\nand\n1996\nare reproduced. These reflect the major area of his research which was mostly in\nalgebraic geometry\n. Eight of the papers reproduced in\n[\n1\n]\nstudy surfaces in\nP\n3\n\\mathbb{P}^{3}\nP\n3\nwith many isolated singularities. This was one of Gallarati's most important mathematical contributions. It is worth noting that some of lower bounds obtained by Gallarati for the maximal number of nodes of surfaces of degree\nn\nn\nn\nwere not improved until comparatively recently and for large values of\nn\nn\nn\nthe exact maximal number of nodes of surfaces of degree\nn\nn\nn\nis still unknown despite much recent work on this topic.\nThree papers given in\n[\n1\n]\nrelate to Gallarati's contributions to Grassmannian geometry. His work on this topic extended in several ways the bound obtained by\nBeniamino Segre\nfor the number of linearly independent linear complexes containing the curve in the Grassmannian corresponding to the tangent lines of a nondegenerate projective curve. Gallarati extended the results to the case of tangent spaces of varieties of arbitrary dimensions, to arbitrary curves in Grassmannians corresponding to nondegenerate scrolls, and to complexes of higher degree.\nGallarati studied properties of varieties whose tangent spaces meet certain linear subspaces along spaces of dimension higher than expected. He gave an elegant characterization of the\nVeronese\nand\nSegre\nvarieties in terms of their tangential properties. Another particularly notable research contribution was made by Gallarati in his work on multiple contacts of surfaces along a curve. He constructed counterexamples to conjectures of\nBabbage\nand Hochster and gave negative answers to questions posed by\nMumford\nand Hartshorne.\nOther work by Gallarati included a classification of\nFano\nvarieties of the second kind, a study of irregularity of double spaces, and the finding of bounds for the class of a surface with ordinary singularities in terms of its degree.\nZak, reviewing\n[\n1\n]\n, remarks that republishing Gallarati's papers:-\n... introduces the modern reader to the almost forgotten world of projective algebraic geometry, Italian style.\nGallarati taught algebraic geometry for many years and notes from these courses still exist\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nThese notes reflect the unique style of their author and are rich in original observations.",
