  "biografia": "Sheila Power\n's parents were Michael Power and Christina Cunniffe. Let us note at this point that she became Sheila Tinney after her marriage but we shall refer to her by the name of Power until we reach the time when she married. Michael Power had been appointed to the Chair of Mathematics at University College Galway in\n1912\nand he held this position for over forty years until he retired in\n1955\n. Christina was very musical and an excellent pianist. Sheila was the fourth of her parents' six children. Her mother died in childbirth in\n1930\nwhen Sheila was twelve years old\n[\n3\n]\n:-\nOne of Sheila's fondest memories was of her mother playing the piano at home, and she became an accomplished pianist herself ...\nSheila was educated at the Dominican College of Taylor's Hill in Galway. This girls' Roman Catholic school had been founded by the Dominican Sisters in\n1858\nand, in keeping with the Dominican philosophy of education, aimed to give an education for the whole person. From the Dominican College of Taylor's Hill in Galway, Sheila went to the Dominican women's house in Cabra on the outskirts of Dublin. She sat the Leaving Certificate in\n1935\nand was awarded Honours in Mathematics. This may not look like a particularly great achievement but, to put it in perspective, we note that she was one of only\n8\ngirls to receive this qualification in mathematics in Ireland in\n1935\nwhile\n126\nboys were successful. Even more surprising for a girl at that time, she entered the Arts Faculty of University College, Galway in\n1935\nto study mathematics. She then transferred to University College, Dublin in\n1936\nand graduated in\n1938\nbeing awarded a B.A. with First Class Honours in Mathematics. She also gained the distinction for being ranked first in her class.\nPower continued to study at University College Dublin for her Master's Degree which she received in\n1939\n. She was awarded a National University of Ireland travelling studentship prize which enabled her to undertake research for her doctorate with\nMax Born\nat the University of Edinburgh in Scotland.\nBorn\nhad been forced to flee from Germany when the Nazis came to power in\n1933\nand, after spells in north Italy and in Cambridge, he had been appointed to the\nTait\nChair of Applied Mathematics at Edinburgh in\n1936\n. He had a number of Ph.D. students in addition to Sheila Power and he looked after them with great attention involving them in his latest research:-\nWhen\nBorn\narrived in the morning he first used to make the round of his research students, asking them whether they had any progress to report, and giving them advice, sometimes presenting them with sheets of elaborate calculations concerning their problems which he had himself done the day before.\nBorn\nand his students were involved in research on the stability of crystal lattices.\nBorn\nwrote the first in a series of papers on this topic with the title\nOn the stability of crystal lattices I\nwhich was published in the\nMathematical Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society\nin\n1940\n. He writes:-\nThe stability of lattices is discussed from the standpoint of the method of small vibrations. It is shown that it is not necessary to determine the whole vibrational spectrum, but only its long wave part.\nThe second paper in this series was written by his student Rama Dhar Misra, the third by\nBorn\nwith Reinhold Fürth, the fourth by\nBorn\nwith Rama Dhar Misra, while the fifth and sixth were written by Reinhold Fürth. Reinhold Henry Fürth\n(1893\n-\n1979)\nwas a Czechoslovakian physics professor at the German University of Prague before World War II but had come to the University of Edinburgh as a research fellow and lecturer. All six of these papers appeared in quick succession in the\nMathematical Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society\nin\n1940\nand\n1941\n. The next in the series, published in the same journal in\n1942\n, was by Power and it was entitled\nOn the stability of crystal lattices. VII. Long-wave and short-wave stability for the face-centred cubic lattice\n. She writes:-\nI take this opportunity of expressing my sincere thanks to Professor\nBorn\nfor much valuable advice.\nA review of the paper by Lothar Wolfgang Nordheim\n(1899\n-\n1985)\nstates:-\nIt is shown that a face centred cubic lattice, in which the forces fall off so rapidly with distance that only those between first neighbours must be considered, is stable against short wave displacements if it is stable against long wave deformations.\nThe next paper in the series, also in the same journal in\n1942\n, was\nOn the stability of crystal lattices. VIII. Stability of rhombohedral Bravais lattices\nby H W Peng and S C Power. It states:-\nThis is part of a thesis presented by Miss S C Power for the Ph.D. degree in the Faculty of Arts, The University, Edinburgh.\nHuan Wu Peng was a Chinese student who had come to the University of Edinburgh to study under\nMax Born\n. Their joint paper was also reviewed by Lothar W Nordheim who writes:-\nThe stability of the Bravais lattices with rhombohedral unit cell of arbitrary angle is investigated under the assumption that the potential contains two terms, each proportional to a reciprocal power of distance. It is shown that among the cubic Bravais lattices contained in this group the face and body centred ones correspond to a minimum of potential energy, but the simple cubic lattice to a maximum. By numerical calculation of the energy of intermediate lattices it is shown that no other extrema for the potential energy exist and that the face centred lattice corresponds to the absolute minimum. Finally, equilibrium conditions for compound lattices with a number of parameters are formulated and it is shown, under assumption of the above form of potential energy, that these conditions can be divided into one set for change of volume and an independent set for change of shape.\nSheila Power had been awarded a Ph.D. by the University of Edinburgh in\n1941\nand in the same year she was appointed as an assistant lecturer at University College, Dublin. She was also given a part-time fellowship at the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies which she took up on\n1\nOctober\n1941\n. Recommended by\nBorn\n, Huan Wu Peng took up a research fellowship at the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies on the same day. A Colloquium was held in July\n1942\nat the Institute.\nPaul Dirac\ngave lectures on quantum electrodynamics and\nArthur Eddington\nlectured on the unification of relativity and quantum theory. In the photograph below taken at the Institute for Advanced Studies during the July\n1942\nColloquium, Sheila Power is seen on the far left. The two in the photograph who are not at present included in this archive are Monsignor Pádraig de Brún\n(1889\n-\n1960)\n, the Professor of Mathematics at St Patrick's College, Maynooth and Albert Joseph McConnell\n(1903\n-\n1993)\n, the Professor of Natural Philosophy at Trinity College Dublin.\nSheila Power, Pádraig de Brún,\nPaul Dirac\n,\nÉamon de Valera\n,\nArthur Conway\n,\nArthur Eddington\n,\nErwin Schrödinger\n, Albert Joseph McConnell.\nWhen she first joined the staff at University College, Dublin, Power had a very heavy teaching load. This was not unusual at this time since most departments had large numbers of students taught by a small number of lecturers. She taught honours students studying mathematical sciences as well as teaching mathematics to large first year classes of engineers.\nIn\n1944\nPower published\nNote on the Influence of Damping on the Compton Scattering\nin the\nProceedings of the Royal Irish Academy. Section A: Mathematical and Physical Sciences\n. At University College, Dublin, she was promoted to a statutory lecturer in\n1945\n. She was awarded a fellowship to go to the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton and, after obtaining permission for leave of absence from University College Dublin, she went to the United States. The records at the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study indicate that her visit started on\n1\nSeptember\n1948\nand lasted until\n30\nJune\n1949\nand that her field of study there was Nuclear Physics. Also at the Institute for Advanced Study at this time were, among others,\nFreeman Dyson\n,\nAlbert Einstein\n,\nHarish-Chandra\n,\nGeorge Uhlenbeck\nand\nHermann Weyl\n. Many years later, Sheila Power would tell her students about her time at Princeton, queuing up for coffee with\nAlbert Einstein\n.\nThe\nRoyal Irish Academy\nwas founded in\n1785\n. Over the years, a small number of honorary women members were elected but no woman was allowed to become a full member until\n1931\nwhen, after taking legal advice, the Academy ruled that \"in the existing state of the law women are eligible\". Still no women were elected, however, until\n1949\nwhen four were elected, two scientists and two in the humanities. Sheila Power has the distinction of being one of these four. Despite her outstanding achievements, Power was not promoted at University College, Dublin, as one would have expected and many of her colleagues sympathised with her on not being made a professor.\nIn\n1951\nSheila Power attended the Edinburgh Mathematical Society Colloquium held at the University of St Andrews. Her father Michael Power also attended this Colloquium as he had the\n1938\nEdinburgh Mathematical Society Colloquium held at the University of St Andrews, one year before his daughter went to undertake research in Edinburgh. Also at the\n1951\nColloquium in St Andrews is Miss N Power who, we assume, must be a sister of Sheila Power. We note that R D Misra, who also worked in\nBorn\n's research group at Edinburgh with Power, attended both the\n1938\nand\n1951\nColloquia. Of those in the\n1942\nDublin Institute photograph above,\nArthur Conway\n, Pádraig de Brún and A J McConnell were also in St Andrews at the\n1938\nEdinburgh Mathematical Society Colloquium.\nIn\n1952\nPower married Seán Tinney who had been one of her former engineering students. Seán, who later became President of the Royal Dublin Society, shared his wife's love of music and had a fine singing voice. They had three children, Deirdre, Ethna and Hugh. Tinney taught postgraduate students in addition to her undergraduate teaching load. One of these graduate students, Philip McShane, writes\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nI think now of my best graduate teacher, Sheila Tinney, who, as it happens, lectured in\nFeynman\n's home-zone, quantum electrodynamics. And, I fondly remember her diagraming, not on the board, but in the air between her and her two students! Luckily, a lot of the stuff was mirror-invariant. The other class-member was Lochlainn O'Raifertaigh\n(1932\n-\n2000)\nwho later worked in the Institute of Theoretical Physics, Dublin, where\nSchrödinger\nworked before him.\nOutside her academic duties, Tinney loved sports\n[\n3\n]\n:-\nTinney regarded exercise as intrinsic to life. She enjoyed the sociability of hill-walking, and more strenuous sports such as skiing and horse riding, and pursued them all wherever she happened to be. From all this, the only injury she regarded as significant was a concussion sustained when thrown by a horse which reared after disturbing a rattlesnake in the countryside near Princeton. She had a deep love of music and of literature, both of which she shared with her husband Seán ...\n[\nAfter their children were born\n]\nshe replaced skiing and riding with tennis and golf.\nTinney continued her association with the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies and she was appointed as a Research Associate in the School of Theoretical Physics of the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies for the three year period from October\n1954\nto September\n1957\n. She was eventually promoted to associate professor of mathematical physics\n(\nquantum theory\n)\nat University College, Dublin, in\n1966\n.\nLet us say a little about her children. Hugh Tinney is a concert pianist with a distinguished international reputation who performs regularly with both the RTÉ National Symphony Orchestra and the RTÉ Concert Orchestra. However, as a schoolboy he had found it difficult to decide which direction he should go. At school he loved sport, particularly tennis at which he excelled, as well as science and languages. He struggled to choose between mathematics, sport or music. His initial choice was mathematics which he studied at University for two years before deciding that he would change to music which he studied in London. For a time Ethna Tinney was a producer with RTÉ Lyric fm. Deirdre Tinney holds a PhD in political science from University College Dublin.\nSheila Tinney retired in\n1978\nwhen she reached the age of sixty. Her health began to deteriorate and in\n1994\nshe was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease\n[\n3\n]\n:-\nThis forced her gradual withdrawal into the privacy of family life, and eventually to the Molyneux Home, where she spent the last nine years of her life. She died peacefully there. She was predeceased by her husband Seán in\n2003\n.\nShe died on\n27\nMarch\n2010\n:-\n...\n(\nvery peacefully\n)\nin the wonderful care of the Matron and all the staff of the Molyneux Home, Leeson Park, Dublin\n6\n, after a long illness borne with fortitude and grace.\nHer funeral was held on\n30\nMarch\n2010\nafter Mass at the Church of the Three Patrons, Rathgar, Dublin. She was buried in Mount Venus Cemetery.",
