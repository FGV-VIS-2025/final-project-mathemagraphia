  "summary": "David Borwein was a Lithuanian born mathematician, brought up in South Africa, who taught in St Andrews, Scotland, for 13 years before spending the rest of his career at the University of Western Ontario, Canada. He wrote 160 papers, mostly on sequences, series, summability and number theory.",
  "biografia": "David Borwein\nwas the son of Joseph Jacob Borwein\n(1893\n-\n1972)\nand Rachel Landau\n(1896\n-\n1985)\n. Joseph Borwein, born on\n1\nJanuary\n1893\nin Panevezys, Lithuania, attended schools in Lithuania before going to France to study at the University of Montpellier and then to Scotland to study at the University of Glasgow. He joined the Royal Air Force and remained in Britain until the end of World War I, after which he returned to Lithuania. He married Rachel Landau in Lithuania on\n10\nOctober\n1922\n; both were Jewish. Joseph and Rachel lived in Kaunas, Lithuania where their first two children were born, David Borwein, born\n24\nMarch\n1924\n, the subject of this biography, and Nelly Helen Borwein, born\n17\nJuly\n1927\n.\nIn\n1930\nthe Borwein family emigrated to South Africa and their third child, Hannah Borwein, was born in Natal on\n10\nOctober\n1932\n. From\n1930\n, Joseph Borwein was employed by the AROP Oil Company which sold petroleum products from the USSR in South Africa. In\n1937\nSouth Africa fixed the price of petrol and AROP closed, so Joseph Borwein started his own engineering business. David Borwein attended schools in South Africa before beginning his university education at the University of Witwatersrand in\n1941\n. He studied electrical engineering and graduated with a B.Sc. in\n1945\n. With World War II still taking place, he entered the Special Signal Services of the South African forces. After the war ended, he returned to the University of Witwatersrand to study mathematics and, in\n1948\n, he was awarded a B.Sc. with Honours in that topic. By this time he was married, having married Bessie Flax\n(\nborn about\n1927)\non\n30\nJune\n1946\nin Yeoville, Johannesburg. Bessie was studying Botany and Zoology at the University of Witwatersrand. David was appointed to a temporary lectureship in mathematics at the University of Witwatersrand in\n1948\n.\nOn\n3\nSeptember\n1948\nDavid and Bessie Borwein arrived in Southampton, England, having sailed from Durban, South Africa, on the\nPretoria Castle\n, calling at the ports of East London, Port Elizabeth, Cape Town and Madeira. On arrival, both claimed that their country of intended future permanent residence would be England. In London they lived at\n422\nb Finchley Road, Hendon, and also at\n24\nTiverton Road, Willesden. David Borwein enrolled as a Ph.D. student at University College, London where he undertook research in mathematics advised by\nStephen Bosanquet\n. He was awarded a Ph.D. in\n1950\nfor his thesis\nThe Cesàro summability of integrals\nand in the same year his first two papers were published in the\nJournal\nof the\nLondon Mathematical Society\n:\nOn the Cesàro summability of integrals\n; and\nA summability factor theorem\n. In\n1951\nhis next paper\nOn the absolute Cesàro summability of integrals\nwas published in the\nProceedings\nof the\nLondon Mathematical Society\n.\nDavid Borwein was appointed to a lectureship in mathematics at the University of St Andrews in\n1950\n. In St Andrews the Borwein family lived at Alvie, Buchanan Gardens\n(1950\n-\n1953)\n, West View Cottage, Lade Braes Lane\n(1954\n-\n1958)\n, and then\n4\nAbbotsford Place\n(1959)\n. They had a house built at\n10\nStrathkinness High Road\n(\nWest Acres\n)\nand moved into the house in\n1960\n.\nArthur Hinton Read\nand has family lived next door but one at no.\n6\nWest Acres. David and Bessie's three children were all born in St Andrews:\nJonathan Michael Borwein\nwas born on\n20\nMay\n1951\n;\nPeter Benjamin Borwein\nwas born on\n10\nMay\n1953\n; and Sarah Tanya Borwein in\n1961\n.\nAlthough Borwein was appointed by\nHerbert Turnbull\nto the lectureship in St Andrews, he never served under him for\nTurnbull\nretired and\nE T Copson\nfilled the Regius Chair of Mathematics from October\n1950\n.\nArthur Hinton Read\nand\nRonald Mitchell\nwere also appointed as Lecturers in Mathematics at the University of St Andrews from\n1950\n, and Borwein,\nRead\nand\nMitchell\njoined\nDan Rutherford\nwho had been on the mathematics staff at St Andrews since\n1933\n. There were quite large mathematics classes with about\n60\nfirst year students,\n50\nsecond year students and\n25\nhonours students in\n1950\n-\n51\n, the first year Borwein taught in St Andrews. One of the best students in that year was\nJames Murray\nwho was in Junior Honours in\n1950\n-\n51\n.\nBorwein's next papers continued his study of summability. These, all published in the\nJournal\nof the\nLondon Mathematical Society\n, were\nNote on summability factors\n(1954)\n,\nIntegration by parts of Cesàro summable integrals\n(1954)\n,\nOn the absolute summability of Stieltjes integrals\n(1954)\n,\nOn the abscissae of summability of a Dirichlet series\n(1955)\n, and\nA theorem on Riesz summability\n(1956)\n. For a complete list of David Borwein's papers, see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nBorwein's mathematical career was developing well and his family life in St Andrews was also a happy one. He often took his young boys\nJonathan\nand\nPeter\nfishing off the pier in St Andrews. They caught rock cod, and Bessie cleaned them and make fish cakes. Borwein built a cage at the bottom of their garden as a home for their two guinea pigs, Gilbert and Gulliver.\nLet me\n[\nEFR\n]\nnow explain my how my contacts with David Borwein began. I attended Madras College, St Andrews, and sat the University of St Andrews First Year Mathematics examinations in June\n1961\nwhile still at school. I began my university career at the University of St Andrews in the Second Year Mathematics Course, called Special Mathematics. There were\n83\nstudents in the class, seven of them first year students. Peter Fantham taught a course on abstract algebra,\nArthur Read\ntaught the linear algebra course, and David Borwein taught the analysis course. This course was my first introduction to\nϵ\n,\nδ\n\\epsilon, \\delta\nϵ\n,\nδ\nanalysis and I enjoyed the clarity and enthusiasm of Borwein's lectures. Also in the Mathematics Department at that time was Bruce Lockhart Robertson Shawyer who was Borwein's Ph.D. student. Not surprisingly, he was undertaking research on summability and he was awarded his doctorate in\n1963\nfor his thesis\nOn Riesz Factors\n. He left St Andrews in\n1962\nwhen appointed at the University of Nottingham. In the same year the joint paper\nOn Riesz summability factors\nby Borwein and Shawyer was published; it was the first of seven joint papers by Borwein and Shawyer.\nThe\nEdinburgh Mathematical Society\nwas, and still is, the main Scottish mathematical society. The Society organised the four yearly St Andrews Colloquium held in St Andrews from\n1926\nbut it had stopped during World War II. The first Colloquium following World War II was held in July\n1951\nand attended by Borwein. He also attended the\n1955\nand\n1959\nSt Andrews Colloquia while on the staff at St Andrews. After he left St Andrews in\n1963\nhe continued to return for the St Andrews Colloquium, but we shall say more about that below. The\nEdinburgh Mathematical Society\nheld about seven lectures each year during the\n1950\ns, most of which were held in Edinburgh. Borwein gave the lecture\nOn the abscissae of the summability of a Dirichlet series\nin Edinburgh in session\n1953\n-\n54\n. The British Mathematical Colloquium was held annually in various universities in the UK beginning in\n1949\n. In September\n1955\nit was held in Exeter and at a meeting of the Committee during the Colloquium, it was decided to hold the\n1956\nmeeting on\n4\n-\n6\nSeptember in St Andrews.\nDan Rutherford\nwas elected Chairman and David Borwein was elected as Secretary and co-opted onto the Committee. The International Congress of Mathematicians, organised by the\nInternational Mathematical Union\n, met in Edinburgh\n14\n-\n21\nAugust\n1958\n. The Assembly of the\nInternational Mathematical Union\nmet in St Andrews\n11\n-\n13\nAugust, before the start of Congress. David Borwein was the organising secretary for this meeting. In\n1959\nBorwein was elected as a fellow of the\nRoyal Society of Edinburgh\n. He was awarded a D.Sc. by the University of London in\n1960\nhaving submitted his published papers as a thesis.\nIn\n1963\nBorwein accepted an invitation from the University of Western Ontario to spend a year as a visiting professor. During this year, he accepted the offer of a professorship. He was Professor from\n1964\nto\n1966\nwhen he was promoted to Senior Professor. In\n1967\nhe became Professor and Head of the Department of Mathematics at the University of Western Ontario and he continued to hold this position until he retired in\n1989\n.\nBruce Watson was both an undergraduate and graduate student at the University of Western Ontario and writes in\n[\n8\n]\nabout David Borwein as his lecturer:-\nIn\n1968\nI sat his fourth-year undergraduate course in\nLebesgue\nMeasure and Integration in\nR\nn\n\\mathbb{R}^{n}\nR\nn\n. His lecture notes, which he seemed to reproduce on the blackboard verbatim, were complete and appeared hand-written. I thought at the time that he must be planning to write a textbook. But, as far as I know, he never followed up. Years later, when I taught the same subject matter, I realised that he had made clever use of ordinate sets rather than the more common simple function approach to measurability. This saved a lot of generalisation when moving from\nR\n1\n\\mathbb{R}^{1}\nR\n1\nto\nR\nn\n\\mathbb{R}^{n}\nR\nn\n.\nThe following year I registered for David's graduate course called \"Introduction to Summability Theory.\" At that time, summability theory was David's main research area. And he used classical, as opposed to functional analytic, techniques. This course was a scary experience for the four graduate students registered. For starters, the textbook was\nG H Hardy\n's classic book \"Divergent Series,\" which is not the easiest read. Then, the students did all the lecturing and the audience consisted not only of David, but of all faculty, visiting faculty and post-docs in the summability research group at Western. Each student felt considerable angst before and during his or her turn at the blackboard.\nAfter leaving St Andrews and taking up the appointment at the University of Western Ontario, David Borwein regularly returned to St Andrews for the St Andrews Colloquium. Sometimes he came alone, sometimes with his wife Bessie, and sometimes with other members of his family. Here is a record of his attendance between\n1964\nand\n1996\n. In\n1964\nDavid Borwein came without family members as he also did in\n1968\n. In\n1972\n, however, David Borwein came with his wife Bessie and daughter Sarah. The\n1976\nSt Andrews Colloquium saw the largest participation by Borweins with David, Bessie, Sarah, their son\nJon Borwein\n,\nJon\n's wife and his child Rachel. In\n1980\nDavid and Bessie attended while in\n1984\n, David, Bessie and their daughter Sarah all came. The\n1988\nSt Andrews Colloquium was attended by David without family members, the\n1992\nColloquium by David, Bessie and their son\nPeter\n, while in\n1996\nDavid was the only Borwein to attend. I\n[\nEFR\n]\ndid not attend the\n1964\nColloquium but I did attend all the others mentioned above. It was a great joy to meet David and chat to him on these occasions. Although I had only taken one of his courses at St Andrews, he treated me as \"his student,\" was encouraging, supportive and interested in how my career was progressing. He told me about the achievements of his sons\nJon\nand\nPeter\nand introduced me to\nJon\nin\n1976\nand\nPeter\nin\n1992\n.\nDavid Borwein had an outstanding research record; you can see a list of\n160\nof his papers at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nHe gave a brief summary of his research interests on his web page. This has now been taken down but can still be seen via the Internet Archive Wayback Machine. Here is a version from\n2006\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nMy main area of research has been the summability theory of series and integrals, in the study of which I have used both classical and functional analysis. I have also considered problems in measure theory and probability theory, and have done some work in number theory and some on approximate subgradients and coderivatives.\nMy most recent work has been in collaboration with\nJ M Borwein\nand latterly also with B A Mares Jr. on some remarkable properties of single- and many-variable sinc integrals, in particular their relationships to volumes of certain symmetric convex polyhedra. This research involved some subtle\nFourier\ntransform techniques. I also worked with W Kratz and U Stadtmüller on one-sided Tauberian theorems for methods of summability based on\nDirichlet\nseries - these methods include standard power series methods as special cases. There are various outstanding problems in both these research areas which I intend to tackle in the future.\nRasul Shafikov spoke about David Borwein's collaboration with his son\nJon Borwein\n[\n9\n]\n:-\nDavid and\nJon\nwere long time collaborators, and produced a series of papers together in various areas during\n2000\n-\n2020\n.\nJon\nwas a mathematical jack of all trades, while David's analytic methods were always relevant. Seven of David's ten most highly cited papers in Mathematical Reviews were co-authored with\nJon\n. The most highly cited of all is a\n1995\npaper which computes sums related to the\nRiemann\nzeta function - this is analytic number theory, and analysis.\nBorwein played a major role in the\nCanadian Mathematical Society\n. He served on the Council in\n1967\n-\n75\n, being on the Executive in\n1969\n-\n75\nand Vice-President\n1973\n-\n75\n. We should note that at that time the society was named the Canadian Mathematical Congress and only changed its name to\nCanadian Mathematical Society\nin\n1978\n. He served again on the Council and the Board of Directors in\n1977\n-\n79\n. He was elected President of the Society in\n1985\n-\n87\nand also from\n1985\nwas on the Executive. We have mentioned above his role as Organising Secretary of the\nInternational Mathematical Union\nmeeting in St Andrews in\n1958\nbut this was not his only involvement with the Union since he served on the Canadian National Committee for the\nInternational Mathematical Union\nin\n1983\n-\n86\n.\nFor several years Borwein was Advanced Problems editor of the\nAmerican Mathematical Monthly\n. He served on the editorial board of\nAnalysis. International Journal of Analysis and its Applications\n. This journal began publication in\n1981\nand Borwein frequently published in it. He was also an associate member of the Centre of Experimental and Constructive Mathematics at Simon Fraser University and spent several periods working there.\nBorwein retired in\n1989\n, not because he wanted to, but simply because there was a mandatory retirement age of\n65\nimposed by the University of Western Ontario. He certainly did not stop mathematical research and he published around\n60\npapers in the\n34\nyears of his \"retirement.\" He was also involved in many other projects. For example, in\n[\n5\n]\nhis activities for the Youth Science Foundation are listed:-\nTwo years of judging at Canada-Wide Science Fairs\n(\nWhitehorse\n1995\n, North Bay\n1996)\n. Judge at the International Science and Engineering Fair in Hamilton\n(1995)\n. Part of group escorting Team Canada to the International Science and Engineering Fair in Tucson\n(1996)\n, Louisville\n(1997\n,\n2002)\n, Fort Worth\n(1998)\n, Philadelphia\n(1999)\n, Detroit\n(2000)\n, and San Jóse\n(2001)\n. Member of the Youth Science Foundation Scientific Advisory Committee which selected Team Canada for these International Science and Engineering Fair's and also for the ones in Cleveland\n(2003)\nand Portland\n(2004)\n.\nBorwein actively worked to change the Ontario mandatory retirement age. He was on both radio and television programmes discussing this issue. But he went further than that in his efforts\n[\n5\n]\n:-\nHe made a presentation in December\n1992\nto the Standing Committee on Administration of Justice of the Ontario Legislature in support of a private member's bill to remove a clause from the Ontario Human Rights Code which allows for discrimination of those aged\n65\nor more. The bill\n(\nwhich he had prompted a local MPP to introduce\n)\nhad second reading approval, but was allowed to die when the parliamentary session ended and never reintroduced.\nBorwein's family gave him great joy\n[\n5\n]\n:-\nIn his later years David was increasingly devoted to Bessie and his family, delighting in watching his grandchildren and great-grandchildren grow.\nThere was, however, great sadness for Borwein too since both his sons died young.\nJonathan Borwein\n, an extraordinarily talented mathematician, died in\n2014\nat the age of\n65\n.\nPeter Borwein\n, also an extraordinarily talented mathematician, suffered from multiple sclerosis for over\n20\nyears and died in\n2020\nat the age of\n67\n. Both have biographies in this archive.\nDavid Borwein's obituary in\nThe Globe and Mail\nbegins as follows\n[\n5\n]\n:-\nDavid Borwein died peacefully in his sleep on\n3\nSeptember\n2021\n, at home. He was\n97\nyears old, enjoyed good health all his life, and left this world with his sharp intellect and wit intact. He is survived by a tight-knit family and community who love him, above all his wife Bessie, and daughter Sarah, his nine grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.\nJonathan Borwein\nwrites about his father in\n[\n3\n]\n:-\n[\nMy father taught me\n]\nabout the 'erkenntnis und praxis' of mathematics: that strange blend of arts and science, of austere Platonic edifice and fallible human creation. I learned of the quiet satisfactions of an intellectual life, but not of a life lived in a vacuum. I was taught to make yet one more revision to a paper and to savour the polish and finish it provided. And, finally, my overarching memory is of my father, at frequent parties arranged by my more outgoing mother, playing generously if not exuberantly the role of host. By mid-evening his eyes would slightly glaze and a stream of cocktail napkins would issue forth covered with formulae and expressions in his careful and concise italic script. I have been unusually privileged. I have worked intensively with both brother and father as equals and have known my father as an intellectual peer for more than a quarter century. In every sense he has been \"the best teacher I ever had.\"",
