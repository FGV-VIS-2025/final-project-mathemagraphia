  "biografia": "William Sheppard\n's father was Edmund Sheppard who was a Judge at the Supreme Court in Queensland, Australia. William was educated at Brisbane Grammar School, Australia, before coming to England and completing his school education at Charterhouse School. He first matriculated at Trinity College, Cambridge, in\n1881\nand was Senior\nWrangler\nin the Mathematical Tripos of\n1884\n. Sheppard was elected a fellow of Trinity College in\n1887\nand, like many mathematicians from this period, he decided on a career in law and was called to the bar.\nQuickly Sheppard realised that his interests were in education rather than law and, in\n1896\n, he was appointed to the Education Department. His initial appointment was as a Junior Examiner, but he gained promotion to Senior Examiner before being appointed as Assistant Secretary in\n1914\n. He retired in\n1921\n.\nSheppard spent some time in Edinburgh following his retirement and during this time he collaborated with\nAitken\n. He joined the\nEdinburgh Mathematical Society\nin December\n1926\nwhile living in Edinburgh and remained a member for the rest of his life. He was also a member of the\nMathematical Association\nand was honoured by that organisation by being elected President for session\n1928\n-\n9\n. He was elected to the\nRoyal Society of Edinburgh\non\n7\nMarch\n1932\n, his proposers being\nSir Edmund T Whittaker\n,\nGeorge James Lidstone\n,\nAlexander C Aitken\n, William Ogilvy Kermack.\nAn obituary, written by\nA C Aitken\nand\nE T Whittaker\n, appears in the\nProceedings\nof the\nRoyal Society of Edinburgh\nVolume\n56\n(1935\n-\n36)\n,\n279\n-\n82\n.\nWe give a version of this obituary at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nOn\n10\nJune\n1902\n, Sheppard married Elsa Stevens; they had three sons.",
