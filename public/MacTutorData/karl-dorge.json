  "biografia": "Karl Dörge\n's father, Friedrich Wilhelm Karl Dörge, was a pastor in Müllerdorf which is close to Halle. Friedrich Dörge was born in Eickendorf near Haldensleben on\n16\nMay\n1864\n. Friedrich's father was a landowner known locally as a \"Halbspänner\" meaning he was a small farmer, owning between\n12\nto\n24\nhectares, and he had to provide, along with other farmers, a complete team for their larger landlords. Friedrich attended real\ngymnasium\nin Halberstadt, the gymnasium in Mühlhausen, and the University of Halle from\n1886\nto\n1889\n. He was ordained on\n13\nFebruary\n1895\n, then became a pastor in Müllerdorf. On\n11\nMarch\n1895\n, in Bornstedt in the Mansfelder Land district, he married the daughter of a mining officer. Karl spent the first five years of his life in Müllerdorf.\nIn\n1905\nthe family moved to Seyda, a village in the district of Wittenberg, where again Dörge's father Friedrich was the local pastor. Friedrich had been successful in the selection process run by the Seyda Churches. There were many applicants for the position and selection followed the usual procedure of giving a trial sermon and being interviewed. Because of his upbringing on a farm, it was assumed that the new rector would be familiar with living conditions in Seyda, as his wife would be in the Mansfelder Land region.\nUntil he was thirteen years old, Karl was educated by private tutors. His own father, in his position as a pastor, ran a school and played a role in the education of his own son. From his father, Karl learnt religion, mathematics, history and German. When World War I began in July\n1914\n, Dörge was fourteen years old and attending school. Because of the war, Germany introduced a new qualification, the Notabitur\n(\nan emergency\nAbitur\n)\n, for boys studying at a Gymnasium who voluntarily enlisted for military service before graduation. Dörge followed this route, enlisted for the army and he passed the Notabitur in Torgau in\n1915\n. Torgau is a town on the banks of the Elbe in northwestern Saxony about\n45\nkm south of the village of Seyda. Dörge served in the army for the duration of World War I, reaching the rank of Lieutenant and being awarded the Iron Cross I and II Class for bravery. Throughout the hard war years his father continued to support the Seyda community as their pastor.\nIn\n1919\n, now nearly twenty years old, Dörge was able to continue his education which had been disrupted by the war. In that year he entered the Friedrich-Wilhelm University in Berlin. Today this university is known as the Humboldt University. He studied mathematics attending courses by leading mathematicians such as\nIssai Schur\n,\nRichard von Mises\n,\nErhard Schmidt\nand\nLudwig Bieberbach\n. He also studied physics and took courses by\nAlbert Einstein\n,\nMax Planck\nand Heinrich Rubens\n(1865\n-\n1922)\n. He continued to study for his doctorate advised by\nIssai Schur\nand he was awarded the degree in\n1925\nfor his\n15\n-page dissertation\nÜber die ganzen rationalen Lösungspaare von algebraischen Gleichungen in zwei Variablen\nⓉ\n(\nOn the whole rational solution pairs of algebraic equations in two variables\n)\n. He corresponded with\nDavid Hilbert\n, for example writing a letter to him in\n1925\n, and also with\nEmmy Noether\n. Dörge's years of study at university had been difficult one since Germany went through a period of hyperinflation which made life close to impossible. In particular towards the end of\n1923\nGermany suffered a total economic collapse.\nDörge\nhabilitated\nat the University of Cologne in\n1926\n. He published several papers in\n1925\n-\n27\n, namely:\nZum Hilbertschen Irreduzibilitätssatz\nⓉ\n(\nOn Hilbert's irreducibility theorem;\n)\n;\nÜber die seltenheit der reduziblen Polynome und der Normalgleichungen\nⓉ\n(\nOn the rarity of irreducible polynomials and the normal equations\n)\n;\nEin Beitrag zur Theorie der diophantischen Gleichungen mit zwei unbekannten\nⓉ\n(\nA contribution to the theory of Diophantine equations with two unknowns\n)\n(\na polished version of his thesis\n)\n; and\nEinfacher Beweis des Hilbertschen Irreduzibilitätssatzes\nⓉ\n(\nA simple proof of Hilbert's irreducibility theorems\n)\n. His father, who had continued to support his parishioners throughout the years of crippling hyperinflation, retired as pastor at Seyda in\n1926\nbut he did not stop work for he continued to manage the parishes of Wolteritz and Hayna. In\n1932\nDörge was promoted to extraordinary professor at the University of Cologne. He had published four papers in\n1930\n, namely\nZur Verteilung der quadratischen Reste\nⓉ\n(\nShowing the distribution of quadratic residues\n)\n,\nBemerkung zum Hilbertschen Irreduzibilitätssatz\nⓉ\n(\nA note on Hilbert's irreducibility theorems\n)\n,\nÜber die Reduzibilität von Polynomen im Körper der reellen Zahlen\nⓉ\n(\nOn the reducibility of polynomials over the real numbers\n)\n, and\nZu der von R von Mises gegebenen Begründung der Wahrscheinlichkeitsrechnung. Erste Mitteilung: Theorie des Glücksspiels\nⓉ\n(\nOn von Mises' axioms of probability. First part: Theory of Gambling\n)\n.\nOn\n30\nJanuary\n1933\nHitler came to power and on\n7\nApril\n1933\nthe Civil Service Law provided the means of removing Jewish teachers from the universities, and of course removing those of Jewish descent from other roles. This did not directly affect Dörge but, of course, the large impact on mathematics throughout Germany had an indirect impact on everyone.\nFelix Hausdorff\nwas forced to retire from his chair in Bonn by the Nazi regime in\n1935\n.\n(\nHe committed suicide on\n26\nJanuary\n1942\nwhen it was clear he was about to be sent to a concentration camp.\n)\nOn\n26\nFebruary\n1936\nthe University of Bonn submitted the following names for the\nHausdorff\nsuccession to the Ministry of Education:\nErnst Kähler\n,\nKonrad Knopp\nand Karl Dörge. By this time, however, the Ministry of Education was more interested in how enthusiastic the candidates were for the Nazi policies rather than their mathematical expertise. As a consequence the Ministry of Education rejected all three names and none of the three was appointed. Dörge remained in Cologne and, perhaps as a consequence of being recommended for a full chair in Bonn, he was appointed to a full chair at Cologne later in\n1936\n.\nDörge continued working on algebra and number theory. On\n9\nJune\n1935\nhe wrote to\nOtto Toeplitz\nreporting on his own results for estimating the number of primes below\n2\nn\n2^{n}\n2\nn\n. In the same letter he reports on other results on the same problem and compares his own results with those of other mathematicians. He published\nZu der von R von Mises gegebenen Begründung der Wahrscheinlichkeitsrechnung\n(\nzweite Mitteilung: Allgemeine Wahrscheinlichkeitstheorie\n)\nⓉ\n(\nOn von Mises' axioms of probability. Second part: General theory of probability\n)\nin\n1936\n. It was in that year that he was made director of Mathematical Seminars at Cologne.\nIn\n1938\nDörge's father, by this time\n74\nyears old, came to live with his son at his home in Lindenthal on the west side of Cologne. Friedrich Dörge spent the last five years of his life living with his son and died on\n28\nMay\n1943\n.\nDörge published a number of books. He published\nÜber den Fundamentalsatz der Algebra\nⓉ\n(\nOn the fundamental theorem of algebra\n)\nin\n1928\n. The first edition of\nWahrscheinlichkeitsrechnung für Nichtmathematiker\nⓉ\n(\nProbability for non-mathematicians\n)\n, co-authored with Hans Klein, was published in\n1939\nand the second edition, after World War II, in\n1947\n. He also published the first volume of\nDifferential- und Integralrechnung\nⓉ\n(\nDifferential and integral calculus\n)\nin\n1948\n. This volume was subtitled\nElemente der Differential- und Integralrechnung einer Veränderlichen, unendliche Folgen und Reihen mit konstanten Gliedern\nⓉ\n(\nElements of differential and integral calculus of one variable, infinite sequences and series with constant terms\n)\n.\nKlaus Wagner\n(31\nMarch\n1910\n-\n6\nFebruary\n2000)\nwas Dörge's most famous student. He received his Ph.D. from the University of Cologne in\n1937\nadvised by Dörge, and taught at Cologne for many years becoming head of the Cologne graph theory school. In\n1970\n, he moved to the University of Duisburg, where he remained until his retirement in\n1978\n.\nLater in his career Dörge studied universal algebra. For example in\nBemerkung über Elimination in beliebigen Mengen mit Operationen\nⓉ\n(\nA  remark about elimination in any amount, with operations\n)\n(1951\n/\n52)\nhe studied infinitary operations. Also in\n(\nwith Heinz Adolf Jung\n)\nAbschliessungen in Klassen strukturierter Mengen\nⓉ\n(\nFinal solutions in classes structured sets\n)\n(1970)\nthe authors find various conditions for existence and uniqueness of algebraic closures in a given class of structures. However, he continued to study topics that had interested him throughout his career. For example he published\n(\nwith Heinz Adolf Jung\n)\nÜber die Seltenheit der reduziblen Polynome\nⓉ\n(\nOn the rarity of reducible polynomials\n)\n(1968)\nwhich referenced his earlier papers\nÜber die Seltenheit der reduziblen Polynome und der Normalgleichungen\nⓉ\n(\nOn the rarity of reducible polynomials and the normal equations\n)\n(1925)\n,\nEinfacher Beweis des Hilbertschen Irreduzibilitätssatzes\nⓉ\n(\nA simple proof of Hilberts irreducibility theorems\n)\n(1926)\n,\nBemerkung zum Hilbertschen Irreduzibilitätssatz\nⓉ\n(\nA note on Hilbert's irreducibility theorems\n)\n(1929)\n, and\nAbschätzung der Anzahl der reduziblen Polynome\nⓉ\n(\nEstimating the number of reducible polynomials\n)\n(1965)\n.\nWe should add one further fact about Dörge, namely his passion for art. He collected both classical art as well as works of contemporary artists. The most notable painting that he owned was a superb copy of Annibale Carracci's\nThe mystic marriage of Saint Catherine\n(1585\n-\n1587)\n. Dörge's copy was made in\n1600\nwhile the original now hangs in the Museo Nazionale di Capodimonte in Naples. His favourite contemporary artist was Joan Miró i Ferrà\n(1893\n-\n1983)\nwho was born in Barcelona. Miró declared that he wanted to assassinate painting by upsetting the visual elements of established painting.",
