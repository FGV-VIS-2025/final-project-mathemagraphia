  "biografia": "Geoffrey Timms\n's father was Frederick Timms\n(\nborn in Leeds, Yorkshire in\n1865\n; died\n1947)\nwho was a Managing Director Ltd Co. of a rope and twine company. His mother was Clare Louisa Barraclough\n(\nborn in Leeds, Yorkshire, in\n1867\n; died\n1946)\n. Geoffrey Timms had a younger brother Alan\n(\nborn about\n1905)\n.\nGeoffrey Timms was an undergraduate at the University of Leeds, graduating with First Class honours in mathematics in\n1925\n. Timms then went to Cambridge where his doctoral work was supervised by\nH F Baker\n. After being awarded a Ph.D. in\n1928\nTimms was appointed as Assistant in\nH W Turnbull\n's department in St Andrews in October\n1929\n.\nTimms remained at St Andrews being appointed as a Lecturer in Mathematics in\n1935\n. During World War II Timms served at Bletchley Park, and was then sent to Cheltenham to use his mathematical skills to assist engineers and physicists. Timms retained his post in St Andrews until September\n1945\nwhen he resigned, deciding to remain with the Foreign Office for the rest of his career. He continued to work for the Foreign Office until\n1968\n.\nFrom February\n1929\n, before taking up his position as an assistant in St Andrews, Timms joined the\nEdinburgh Mathematical Society\n. He was honoured by the Society by being elected as president for session\n1941\n-\n42\n. He was elected to the\nRoyal Society of Edinburgh\non\n6\nMarch\n1933\n, his proposers being\nHerbert Westren Turnbull\n,\nEdward Thomas Copson\n,\nAlexander Craig Aitken\n,\nSir Edmund T Whittaker\n.\nAn obituary, written by\nW L Edge\n, appears in the\nRoyal Society of Edinburgh\nYear Book\n1984\n, page\n213\n.\nWe give a version of this obituary at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nAs an example of Timms' papers, he published\nOn the highest space in which a non-ruled surface of given order can lie\nin\n1940\n. T R Hollcroft writes:-\nMore than a half century ago, del Pezzo showed that a non-ruled algebraic surface of order\nn\nn\nn\nlies in a space of maximum dimension\nR\nR\nR\nsuch that\nR\n=\nn\nR = n\nR\n=\nn\nfor\nn\n≤\n9\n,\nn\n≠\n4\nn ≤ 9, n ≠ 4\nn\n≤\n9\n,\nn\n\n​\n=\n4\n, and\nR\n<\nn\nR < n\nR\n<\nn\nfor\nn\n≥\n10\nn ≥ 10\nn\n≥\n1\n0\n. In the present paper, the exact value of\nR\nR\nR\nfor a given\nn\nn\nn\nis found to be\nR\n=\nI\n(\n3\nn\n/\n4\n)\n+\n2\n,\nn\n≠\n1\n,\n2\n,\n3\n,\n9\nR = I(3n/4) + 2, n ≠ 1, 2, 3, 9\nR\n=\nI\n(\n3\nn\n/\n4\n)\n+\n2\n,\nn\n\n​\n=\n1\n,\n2\n,\n3\n,\n9\n, where\nI\n(\nx\n)\nI(x)\nI\n(\nx\n)\ndenotes the integral part of\nx\nx\nx\n. An example is given of a rational surface of order\nn\nn\nn\nfor which the maximum value\nR\nR\nR\nis attained.",
