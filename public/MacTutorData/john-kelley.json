  "summary": "John Kelley was an American mathematician who worked in general topology and functional analysis. He is best known for his standard topology textbook.",
  "biografia": "John Kelley\n's parents were Charles G Kelley\n(1873\n-\n1968)\nand Estella F Hogan\n(1886\n-\n1977)\n. Charles Kelley is described as a \"minister\" in the\n1920\ncensus, and a \"travelling salesman in groceries\" in the\n1930\ncensus. Estella was a school teacher. Charles and Estella Kelley, both from Missouri, were married on\n2\nJune\n1910\nin Winona, Shannon, Missouri. They had four children: Paul Kelley\n(\nborn about\n1912\nin Missouri\n)\n, Lois E Kelley\n(\nborn about\n1915\nin Colorado\n)\n, John Leroy Kelley, the subject of this biography born in Kansas in\n1916\n, and Charles R Kelley, born\n22\nSeptember\n1922\nin Oklahoma. We note that, at times, the family used one or other of their two given names, e.g. Paul Kelley appears in this form in the\n1930\ncensus but as Archie P Kelley in\n1920\n. John Kelley appears as John L Kelley in\n1920\nbut as Leroy Kelley in\n1930\n. Kelley writes\n(\nsee\n[\n9\n]\nor\n[\n10\n]\n)\n:-\nFor the first thirteen years of my life my family was not urban, nor suburban, but just country. We lived in small towns, the largest with fewer than\n2500\ninhabitants: the roads were unpaved, we had no radio and television hadn't been invented. I was born in my family's house\n(\nthere was no hospital in town\n)\n... I was a genuine, twenty-four-carat country boy, a vanishing breed in these United States.\nIn\n1920\nthe family were living in Cedar Street, Lincoln, Kansas. Later they moved to Meno, Oklahoma where Kelley began his schooling\n(\nsee\n[\n9\n]\nor\n[\n10\n]\n)\n:-\nMy schooling began in Meno, Oklahoma, which was then a village of a few hundred people, two churches, one general store, a blacksmith's and a one-room school. There were no electricity and the town centre was marked by a couple of hundred feet of boardwalk on one side of the road. I went to school at a very early age because my mother was the school teacher and there weren't any babysitters. I remember my first day at school; I got spanked. There were about thirty students in the school, spread over the first eight grades. ... The arithmetic I was taught by my mother during the two years in Meno ...\nFor more details of his school experiences, see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nLeaving Meno, the family moved to four or five other small towns and, by the time of the\n1930\ncensus, they were living in High Land Village, Gunnison, Colorado. The state legislature in Colorado passed a law preventing married women from being teachers\n(\nan attempt to help with the high unemployment of the Great Depression\n)\nand this was one of the reasons the family moved from Colorado to Los Angles, California, later in\n1930\n. Kelley's final year of high school was in Los Angles. At school, he had loved mathematics, physics and art. At some stage he had felt that he wanted to be a mathematician, or an artist, or a physicist. By the time he left high school and entered Los Angeles Junior College in\n1931\nhe had decided to specialise in physics. He spent two years at the College, taking four semesters of physics but also taking the required mathematics courses: Intermediate Algebra, College Algebra, Trigonometry, and Analytic Geometry. Experimental work in physics laboratories had not gone particularly well so by the time he left the College and entered the University of California, Los Angeles, in\n1933\nhe aimed to major in mathematics.\nOf course\n1933\nwas in the middle of the Great Depression and so anyone beginning a university course at this time would have thought seriously about possible careers. Deciding that his best option was to become a mathematics teacher, he took an education course in each of his first three semesters. He took a part-time job as a school parking attendant to bring in some badly needed money although he was delighted with his good fortune in receiving free education in the California system. He took all the geometry courses that were on offer, mostly given by Paul H Daus\n(1894\n-\n1973)\n. Daus had studied at the University of Chicago where he met\nDerrick N Lehmer\nwho became his Ph.D. advisor after he moved to the University of California at Berkeley. Daus had been awarded a Ph.D. for his thesis\nNormal Ternary Continued Fraction Expansions for the Cube Roots of Integers\n(1921)\n. He was appointed to the University of California, Los Angeles in\n1922\nwhere he worked for the rest of his career. Although he wrote his Ph.D. on number theory, Daus was mainly interested in geometry and taught the geometry courses that Kelley attended.\nEarle Raymond Hedrick\nwas the chair of the mathematics department at this time and Kelley attended courses that\nHedrick\ntaught, admiring his \"flamboyant lecturing style.\" Kelley gave up the idea of being a high school teacher, dropped education courses, and concentrated on mathematics. His abilities were clear to the department and he was given a part-time job in the mathematics office in place of his work as a school parking attendant.\nWith the idea now of becoming a mathematics lecturer, Kelley took advice on giving mathematics instruction from William Marvin Whyburn. W M Whyburn had been at the University of Texas where he had learnt about the\nR L Moore\nmethod of instruction. Appointed to the University of California, Los Angeles, in\n1928\n, he was able to give Kelley valuable advice on how to teach. Kelley graduated in\n1936\nand was appointed as a teaching assistant but W M Whyburn told him that to progress he required a Ph.D. The University of California, Los Angeles, had no doctoral programme at this time so in\n1937\nhe went to the University of Virginia where W M Whyburn had arranged a teaching assistant position for him. The reason for choosing the University of Virginia will become clear once we explain that W M Whyburn's younger brother,\nGordon Thomas Whyburn\n, had accepted an appointment as professor and chairman of the Department of Mathematics at the University of Virginia in\n1934\n.\nG T Whyburn\nbecame Kelley's Ph.D. advisor.\nResearch at the University of Virginia went well for Kelley and by\n1939\nhe had two papers in print, namely\nFixed sets under homeomorphisms\nand\nA metric connected with property S\n. The second of these two papers, submitted to the\nAmerican Journal of Mathematics\nin September\n1938\n, answered a question posed by\nG T Whyburn\nin a paper published in\n1932\n. Kelley was awarded a Ph.D. in June\n1940\nfor his thesis\nA Study of Hyperspaces.\nHe explains in\n[\n9\n]\nor\n[\n10\n]\nabout the help in writing it he received:-\nIn\n1940\nI wrote a thesis,\nWhyburn\nmade me revise it,\nMcShane\nmade me revise it again, and Hedlund said he'd revise except it was too late in the year. So it was accepted and then\nSammy Eilenberg\nspent a couple of weeks revising and making me revise. This training, with a post-doctoral bit from\nPaul Halmos\na few years later, is how I learned to write mathematics.\nLet us briefly explain who these mathematicians were.\nWhyburn\nwas his thesis advisor\nGordon Thomas Whyburn\n.\nMcShane\nwas\nEdward James McShane\nwho had been appointed to a professorship at the University of Virginia at Charlottesville in\n1935\n. Hedlund was Gustav Arnold Hedlund\n(1904\n-\n1993)\nwho taught at the University of Virginia from\n1939\nto\n1948\n.\nSamuel Eilenberg\nleft Poland and arrived in the United States in\n1939\n. He was appointed to the University of Michigan in\n1940\nand met Kelley at a topology conference held at the University of Michigan\n24\nJune to\n6\nJuly\n1940\n. Following the award of his Ph.D., Kelley took up an appointment at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana. He lived at South Bend, St Joseph, Indiana.\nLet us record at this point that Kelley had married Elizabeth Chappell on\n9\nth May,\n1938\nin Charlottesville, Virginia. His wife was always known as Nancy and they had three children, John L Kelley\n(2\nnd\n)\n(\nborn\n27\nJuly\n1940)\n, Charles B Kelley\n(\nborn\n19\nDecember\n1946)\nand Robert P Kelley. On\n16\nOctober\n1940\nKelley registered for the draft. His personal details were as follows: Employer - University of Notre Dame; Weight -\n150\nlbs; Complexion - Light; Eye Colour - Hazel; Hair Colour -Brown; Height:\n5\nft\n10\nins; Next of Kin - Nancy Kelley.\nWorld War II had broken out on\n1\nSeptember\n1939\nwith the invasion of Poland by Germany. Soon much of Europe was engaged in the war but at this stage the United States remained neutral. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on\n7\nDecember\n1941\n, however, saw the United States enter the war\n[\n3\n]\n:-\nAfter the U.S. entered World War II,\nE J McShane\nbecame head of the theory section of the Ballistics Research Laboratory in Aberdeen, Maryland. He summoned Kelley to join his group, arranging for Kelley to be released from his teaching job at Notre Dame. Kelley spent the rest of the war in Aberdeen, where he wrote his first book, 'Exterior Ballistics'\n(1953)\n, co-authored with\nMcShane\nand Franklin V Reno.\nThe authors wrote in the Preface on\n12\nJuly\n1949\n:-\nAs a rule the authors of a scientific book presumably hope that it will prove useful. The authors of this book wish devoutly that it will turn out to be quite useless, and that the application of exterior ballistics, with lethal intent, may cease. Nevertheless it is clear that armies will mass and nations stand in readiness for war until \"Homo sapiens\" succeeds in better deserving his self-bestowed name. While this endures, there must be many who know something about the flight of projectiles, and a few who know much about it. For these, this book is written. To the optimist who feels that this book is pointless because there will never be another war we can say only that we hope he is right. To the pessimist who feels that this book is pointless because the next war will be fought with weapons of such wide destructive power that it matters little where they are delivered, we would say that few weapons indeed, having once been useful, have been entirely discarded. The battle-axe survived in the hatchet of the commandos; the spear survived in the bayonet and even sticks and stones killed many in the first days of the independence of India. If there is another war, we may feel reasonably sure that guns, bombs and rockets will not be useless.\nBy March\n1952\nthe authors say that their views have not changed \"save for the abandonment of the wisp of optimism.\"\nAt the end of the war, Kelley moved to the University of Chicago but\nOswald Veblen\narranged that he could spend time at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton. It was agreed that his salary was split between the University of Chicago and the Institute for Advanced Study. Kelley was at the Institute from September\n1945\nuntil June\n1946\n. Back in Chicago, Kelley found the\n1946\n-\n47\nseminar very stimulating and he wrote\n(\nsee\n[\n9\n]\nor\n[\n10\n]\n)\n:-\nThe Chicago seminar had a decisive effect on the direction of my work.\nDespite enjoying the University of Chicago, when Kelley was approached by the University of California at Berkeley to accept a position there as Associate Professor he was persuaded. He arrived in Berkeley in\n1947\n, describing the mathematics department at the time as follows\n(\nsee\n[\n9\n]\nor\n[\n10\n]\n)\n:-\n... very strong in analysis, statistics, set theory and the foundations of mathematics, and not strong in other areas. It was a harmonious group, although there was a bit of jealousy of the statisticians because they could get consulting money and were generally a little more prosperous than the rest of us\n(\nsomething like the computing science people today\n)\n. But this was temporary; statistics emigrated to become a separate department sometime in\n1949\n.\nThe time when Kelley was beginning his career at Berkeley coincided with heightened fears of Communism in the United States. This began in\n1947\nwhen President Truman gave an order that federal employees had to be screened for possible associations with Communist and other organisations. The University of California decided that it would require all staff to sign an oath declaring they had never been members of the Communist Party. Some staff refused to sign, including Kelley, and all those were made to appear before the Committee on Privilege and Tenure which, in June\n1950\n, recommended that all but five should continue in employment. Kelley was one of the five to be fired. The Regents, however, after considering the report of the Committee on Privilege and Tenure, decided to give all who had not signed\n30\ndays in which to do so, and then fired all those who refused to sign. He wrote\n(\nsee\n[\n9\n]\nor\n[\n10\n]\n)\n:-\nI hit the panic button and wrote\nVeblen\n,\nWhyburn\n,\nMcShane\n,\nLefschetz\nand a couple of others. It was June, I had a wife and three children and just two months' salary in sight.\nKelley had never been a member of the Communist Party, but he still refused to sign. He wrote\n(\nsee\n[\n9\n]\nor\n[\n10\n]\n)\n:-\nThe Regents' problem with us non-signers wasn't communism; it was insubordination. ... at that time I did consulting work for Aberdeen Proving Ground, Redstone Arsenal, Sandia Corporation, and Los Alamos and was cleared for highly classified material. I see no way that the Berkeley administration and the Committee on Privilege and Tenure could have failed to know this; the problem with me was that I wouldn't say I wasn't a communist.\nHe was able to get a temporary position at Tulane University during\n1950\n-\n52\n. Here he completed writing the book for which he is best known, namely\nGeneral Topology\nwhich was published in\n1955\n.\nFor the Preface and Acknowledgements from\nGeneral Topology\nsee\nTHIS LINK\n.\nFor extracts from reviews of Kelley's books\n(\nincluding\nGeneral Topology\n)\n, see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nHe gave the course 'Topics in Modern Algebra' at Tulane which was attended by Isaac Namioka who writes\n[\n14\n]\n:-\nI was immediately captivated by Kelley's teaching style and the subject matter. Everything was new and exiting. The general topology segment was based on Kelley's manuscript of the now classic book on the subject and was very polished. The class was conducted on a modified \"\nMoore\nmethod\": the proofs of most theorems are left to the \"tender mercies\" of the students, but for difficult ones such as\nUrysohn\n's lemma and\nTychonoff\n's theorem the proofs were given in full. We students were fortunate that Kelley's book was not available then, for we had to work very hard to do all the assigned proofs on our own. I learned a lot about mathematical presentation. He would patiently listen to my clumsy proof and awful notation, and at the end, with a twitching smile, he would suggest some changes which suddenly made everything clearer and often shorter.\nFollowing his temporary position at Tulane University, Kelley spent the year\n1952\n-\n53\nat the University of Kansas. During this year he organised a group of mathematicians to collaborate on writing the book\nLinear topological spaces\n. In fact there are ten authors listed in the book:-\n... who happened to agree\n(\nin\n1953)\non how to arrange the theory of topological linear spaces in such a way as to make the more recent\n(\nat that time\n)\nresults on duality appear as the natural consequences of the preliminary work.\nFor an extract from the Foreword of the book and extracts from reviews, see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nTowards the end of\n1952\n, the California Supreme Court declared the University of California oath unconstitutional and also declared that those who had been fired should be rehired. Kelley was back at Berkeley for the beginning of session\n1953\n-\n54\n.\nThe influence of Kelley on the development of the Mathematics Department at Berkeley is described in\n[\n3\n]\n:-\nKelley returned to Berkeley in\n1953\nas a Postdoctoral Fellow of the National Science Foundation. His years of service in administration began in\n1955\n-\n57\n, when he was successively Vice Chair of the Department of Mathematics and Administrative Assistant to the Chancellor. Kelley chaired the Mathematics Department during\n1957\n-\n60\n, initiating revolutionary changes in both curriculum and composition of the faculty. He led the faculty to discard several traditional courses for beginning students, adopting calculus as the starting course of the undergraduate curriculum. Upper-division courses were arranged in areas from which math majors met breadth and depth requirements. Simultaneously, he reorganized the teaching of calculus so that every student attended lectures by a professor and discussion sections with a tutorial assistant, whereas formerly only\n10\n% of the students saw the professor while\n90\n% saw only a tutorial assistant. When Kelley became chair, Berkeley's Department of Mathematics was among the leaders in the areas of analysis and logic-foundations, but it recognized the need to build in other areas, notably geometry-topology and algebra. Efforts of previous chairs to lure prominent scholars in our weaker areas had been unsuccessful, in part because people in those areas feared being isolated on the West Coast. Kelley had the brilliant idea of trying to hire senior faculty members two-at-a-time. In\n1958\nhe managed to persuade algebraists Gerhard Hochschild and Maxwell Rosenlicht to accept offers. Later the same strategy worked to bring geometer\nShiing-Shen Chern\nand topologist\nEdwin Spanier\n. With those big names on board it was easy to attract young scholars and graduate students in their areas. From\n1970\non, the department has been in the top two in national rankings.\nAround\n1962\n, Kelley married to Ying Lee\n(\nborn in Shanghai in\n1932)\nwho grew up in China and Hong Kong, and in the\n1970\ns became the first Asian American elected to the Berkeley City Council. Both Kelley and his wife supported students who demonstrated about issues such as free speech, the Vietnam War and divesting the university's South African funds. Both Kelley and Ying Lee were arrested during the protests.\nSome additional activities of Kelley are described in\n[\n16\n]\n:-\nKelley served on the Council of the\nAmerican Mathematical Society\nand on The Board of Governors of the\nMathematical Association of America\n. He was a Fulbright Research Professor at Cambridge, England, from\n1957\nto\n1958\nand accepted an Agency for International Development appointment as adviser and teacher at The Indian Institute of Technology in Kanpur, India, from\n1964\nto\n1965\n.\nFor his year as Fulbright Research Professor, Kelley, his wife Nancy, and their three sons, sailed on the\nDuivendijk\nto Liverpool, England, arriving on\n24\nOctober\n1957\nto spend an academic year at Trinity College, Cambridge.\nOther activities we should note are involved with the School Mathematics Study Group which was designing new mathematical texts for high schools. Kelley wrote two such texts, see extracts from reviews of the books at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nRelated to this work on developing a new school mathematics curriculum was his television appearances\n[\n3\n]\n:-\nIn\n1960\nhe took an extended leave to serve as the National Teacher on NBC's 'Continental Classroom' TV program. His tweed jackets, with pipe ready to be puffed in the close-ups, helped instil confidence among viewers who might have been taken aback by the new ways of teaching he promoted.\nKelley retired in\n1985\nbut he did not give up mathematical research, continuing to collaborate with T P Srinivasan. He remained active up to the his final months\n[\n3\n]\n:-\nIn May\n1999\n, a friend brought him to the annual department dinner where he visited with old colleagues not seen for years. In October he came to a two-day conference on campus to commemorate the battle over the Loyalty Oath\n50\nyears before, and in November he passed away. ... Besides his accomplishments in mathematics and education, Kelley will be remembered for the twinkle in his eyes, for his infectious smile, and for his warm manner, which made everyone feel comfortable in his presence. But perhaps most he will be remembered as a man of deep principles, born of the injustices he witnessed during the Great Depression, and borne staunchly throughout his life.",
