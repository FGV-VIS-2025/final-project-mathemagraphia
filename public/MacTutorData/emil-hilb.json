  "biografia": "Emil Hilb\nwas the son of Adolf Hilb\n(1850\n-\n1894)\nand Klarchen Ulrich\n(1855\n-\n1926)\n. Let us note at this point that there is some confusion as to whether his birthday was\n24\nApril or\n26\nApril. The\n24\nApril date appears on all official documents Hilb completed early in his career, but later he gave his day of birth as\n26\nApril which is the day given in the Stuttgart registry records. The date of birth of\n24\nApril, however, is given on Hilb's gravestone, so we have followed that data.\nWe now give a paragraph with details of the Hilb family, mostly taken from\n[\n1\n]\n. Adolf Hilb was born\n20\nMay\n1850\ninto a Jewish family in Stuttgart, Baden-Württemberg, Germany, a son of Salomon Hilb\n(1815\n-\n1885)\nand Rosalie Kuhn\n(1819\n-\n1895)\n. He became a merchant, working in Stuttgart all his life. Klarchen Ulrich, known as Clara, was born on\n18\nSeptember\n1855\nin Harburg, a daughter of Jakob Ulrich and Sofie Schwab. She married Adolf Hilb in\n1876\nin Ulm, Baden-Württemberg. Adolf and Clara Hilb had four children, Elsa\n(\nborn\n1877)\n, Max\n(\nborn\n1879)\n, Emil\n(\nthe subject of this biography, born\n1882)\n, and Julius\n(\nborn\n1885)\n.\nIn\n1890\nEmil Hilb began his school education at the Eberhard Ludwig\nGymnasium\nin Stuttgart. This school was founded in\n1686\nbut it was only named the Eberhard Ludwig Gymnasium in\n1881\nwhen a second Gymnasium was opened in Stuttgart. After Emil's father died on\n12\nJune\n1894\nat the age of\n44\n, his mother Clara decided to move with her children to Augsburg to he closer to her hometown of Harburg in Donau-Ries, Bavaria. In Augsburg, Hilb entered the Realgymnasium where he studied from\n1894\nto\n1899\n. The headmaster of the Realgymnasium was Georg Recknagel\n(1835\n-\n1920)\nand he had studied mathematics and physics in Munich and Würzburg before being awarded a doctorate in\n1862\nfrom the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. He taught in Kaiserslautern and Passau before being appointed to teach mathematics and physics at the Realgymnasium in Augsburg in\n1891\n. He became the headmaster of the school in the following year but continued to teach mathematics and physics. Hilb later said how important Recknagel's mathematics teaching had been in inspiring him to become a mathematician.\nHilb was the youngest member of his class when he graduated from the school in\n1899\nand he entered the University and the Polytechnic in Munich in the winter semester of that year to study mathematics and physics. He took the standard introductory courses but also took two advanced classes by\nAlfred Pringsheim\n, Function Theory I in the first semester of\n1899\n-\n1900\nand Function Theory II in the second semester. It was typical of German students of this time to spend time at different universities and Hilb spent the two years\n1900\n-\n1902\nat the University of Berlin. He wrote in the CV attached to his habilitation thesis of\n1907\n(\nsee for example\n[\n9\n]\n)\n:-\nIn order to continue my education in function theory, I went to the University of Berlin for two years, where I attended Professor\nFuchs\n' lectures on differential equations and higher function theory\n(\nautomorphic functions, etc.\n)\n. Through lectures with Professor\nH A Schwarz\nI was introduced to\nWeierstrass\n's ideas there; in the colloquia led by\nSchwarz\n, I learnt about his basic works on conformal mapping and boundary value problems, which are published in the second volume of\nSchwarz\n' collected works\n[\n'Gesammelte Mathematische Abhandlungen von H A Schwarz'\nⓉ\n(\nCollected mathematical works of H A Schwarz\n)\n(1890)]\n.\nAfter two years in Berlin, Hilb returned to Munich in\n1902\nwhere his thesis advisor was\nFerdinand von Lindemann\n. His\n60\n-page thesis\nBeiträge zur Theorie der Laméschen Funktionen\nⓉ\n(\nContributions to the theory of Lamé functions\n)\nearned him his doctorate in December\n1903\n'summa cum laude'. He had already passed the two stages, in\n1901\nand\n1903\n, of the State Examinations which qualified him to teach mathematics and physics at Gymnasiums. Both parts were rated \"very good\". He then went to Göttingen to continue his studies and was immediately introduced to\nDavid Hilbert\n's current project on\nThe Principles of a General Theory of Linear Integral Equations\n. The other person at Göttingen who was a major influence on him was\nFelix Klein\n. Hilb wrote in the CV in his\n1907\nhabilitation thesis:-\nThe suggestions that I received then and in later years through oral and written correspondence between Professor\nHilbert\nand Professor\nKlein\nwas of the greatest influence for my work published after the doctoral dissertation.\nHilb always wanted to support his mother as much as possible so, after his time in Göttingen, he applied for a teaching position in the Realgymnasium in Augsburg where he himself had been taught. He was appointed and took up his position on\n24\nSeptember\n1904\n. He taught third year secondary school pupils, the syllabus being:-\nDecimal fractions; the\n4\noperations with decimal fractions; transformation of ordinary fractions into periodic decimal fractions and vice versa; simple and composite accounts, interest calculation. Exercises in mental arithmetic.\nDespite teaching elementary topics full time, Hilb was also undertaking research with the aim of entering university teaching. On\n21\nNovember\n1904\n, he wrote to\nHilbert\nexplaining that he had successfully applied\nHilbert\n's method of integral equations to a problem in potential theory and asked him whether his results were worth writing up and publishing.\nHilbert\nencouraged him to write up the results and they appeared as Hilb's first paper\nDie Reihenentwicklungen der Potentialtheorie\nⓉ\n(\nThe series developments of the potential theory\n)\npublished in\nMathematische Annalen\nin\n1906\n.\nAlbert Wangerin\nwrites in a review of the paper:-\nAs is known, the most important systems of orthogonal functions used in potential theory can be seen as special cases of the system of confocal cyclids, and accordingly most of the series expansions occurring in that theory are contained in the series, by means of which the boundary value problem is solved for a body confined by six confocal cyclids. This general task is dealt with in detail in\nBôcher\n's book \"On the series expansions of potential theory\"; however, there is no evidence of the existence and convergence of the expansions. The present work should fill the gap that still exists here. It is based on\nHilbert\n's methods of the integral equation and shows that from the much more general\nHilbert\ntheorems the convergence of the series under consideration results almost without calculation.\nFor a list of Hilb's papers, see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nMax Noether\nand\nFelix Klein\nwere friends from their student days and it is likely that\nMax Noether\nwas recommended the promising young mathematician Hilb through\nKlein\n. Certainly\nMax Noether\noffered Hilb an appointment as an assistant to the chair of mathematics at the University of Erlangen and he took up this appointment in September\n1906\n. In April\n1907\nPaul Gordan\n, who had been at Erlangen for over\n30\nyears, celebrated his\n70\nth birthday and\nFelix Klein\ncame to Erlangen and gave a lecture on his oscillation theorem to mark the occasion. This was particularly relevant to Hilb who had published\nEine Erweiterung des Kleinschen Oszillationstheorems\nⓉ\n(\nAn extension of Klein's oscillation theorem\n)\n(1907)\n. When\nKlein\nwas in Erlangen he suggested to Hilb that he might try to prove some conjectures he had made in a recent paper. Hilb succeeded and wrote the paper\nÜber Kleinsche Theoreme in der Theorie der linearen Differentialgleichungen\nⓉ\n(\nOn Klein's theorems in the theory of linear differential equations\n)\n(1908)\nwhere, after relating\nKlein\n's suggestions to him, he explains:-\nI now found this proof to be extremely easy with elementary continuity considerations, which are quite analogous to those used in the teaching of the real roots of real algebraic equations. With the same ease, however, it is also possible to solve from the beginning all the problems that Mr\nKlein\nhas proposed ...\nHilb submitted his\nhabilitation\nthesis\nÜber Integraldarstellungen willkürlicher Funktionen\nⓉ\n(\nAbout integral representations of arbitrary functions\n)\nto the University of Erlangen in\n1907\nand\nPaul Gordan\nand\nMax Noether\nwere asked to report on it. They wrote:-\nThe work contains very remarkable progress in a still fresh area. In the this work the author has taken up these developments with great energy, which are promising for the whole of functional theory and also for mathematical physics. It can be seen that he has mastered all functional theoretical techniques and is very sharp.\nIn April\n1908\nHilb became a\ndocent\nat Erlangen but soon after this an extraordinary professorship became vacant at the University of Würzburg.\nFriedrich Emil Fritz Prym\n(1841\n-\n1915)\nhad studied for a doctorate at the University of Berlin advised by\nErnst Kummer\nand had been on the faculty at the University of Würzburg since\n1867\n. He held an ordinary professorship at Würzburg, retiring in\n1909\n. Eduard Ritter von Weber\n(1870\n-\n1934)\nhad studied at Munich, habilitated there in\n1895\nand became a professor at Munich in\n1903\n. He had been appointed as an extraordinary professor at Würzburg in\n1907\n. Another mathematician at Würzburg was Georg Rost\n(1870\n-\n1958)\nwho had been a student of Friedrich Prym at Würzburg and then worked there on the staff for the rest of his career. When Prym retired, Eduard von Weber was promoted to ordinary professor on\n3\nJuly\n1909\nand Würzburg looked to appoint an extraordinary professor. The mathematicians at Würzburg knew of Hilb as a very promising young mathematician and Rost went to Erlangen to listen to one of Hilb's lectures. Hilb's recommendation included the following:-\nHe is a very excellent researcher, keen thinking, quick to understand, working both abstractly and with intuition, full of ideas ... Many brilliant achievements can still be expected from him while a young man. In Erlangen he gave exercises and lectures for beginners as well as for more mature students from different areas of mathematics with excellent success.\nThe shortlist of candidates was drawn up ranking\nErnst Zermelo\nas first, Hilb as second and Gerhard Hessenberg\n(1874\n-\n1925)\nin third place. In fact\nZermelo\nhad been a candidate for a extraordinary professorship at Würzburg in\n1906\nbut Rost had been appointed then and again in\n1909\n, despite being ranked first, he was not offered the position but the offer was made to Hilb. On\n4\nAugust\n1909\n, Hilb wrote to\nHilbert\n:-\nI have just come from Würzburg, where I received confirmation of the fact that sounded to me almost fairytale-like that I had been appointed professor there ... I am almost ashamed of my luck, however, when I think of the many who would have earned the job much sooner thanks to their much greater merit; but I will now make double efforts to make myself worthy of the award.\nAt Würzburg Hilb supervised the doctoral studies of eleven students:\nOtto Haupt\n(1911)\n, Emil Goldschmidt\n(1912)\n, Friedrich Betschler\n(1914)\n, Siegfried Weikersheimer\n(1914)\n, Gustav Löwenstein\n(1915)\n, Richard Bär\n(1916)\n, Axel Schur\n(1920)\n, Walter Weidringer\n(1929)\n, Joseph Roth\n(1930)\n, Valentin Völker\n(1931)\nand Beda Thum\n(1932)\n.\nOtto Haupt\nwrites about Hilb as a teacher\n[\n3\n]\n:-\nFor Hilb ... it was an innermost need to look around for young people interested in science and to try to draw them into the circle of his scientific work. He spared no effort to encourage the beginner. Then the lecture was continued on the way home or other scientific entertainment was given, since he was a young man himself, a good companion, in front of whom one could safely say stupid things. But in no way did he hold back with his criticism. I myself know how helpful his sarcastic judgment could be for the novice.\nOn\n18\nMay\n1912\n, Hilb married Marianne Alice Wolff\n(1889\n-\n1943)\nin Würzburg. Marianne was the daughter of the Jewish textile manufacturer Oskar Wolff and his wife Gertrud Ostwald who were wealthy and had given Marianne a good education. She was musical and gifted in foreign languages. They made their home in Seelbergstrasse\n5\nand entertained friends, colleagues and students there. They had two daughters, Irene\n(1914\n-\n1943)\nand Anneliese\n(1918\n-\n2005)\n. Hans-Joachim Vollrath writes\n[\n9\n]\n:-\nStudents were often invited to lunch on Sundays. Once a student didn't leave until midnight. They were happy that he had felt so comfortable. Students were also often invited to social events. They were popular as dancers. With the exception of Wagner, Hilb liked to listen to classical music. He enjoyed his wife's piano playing, but played no instrument himself. He deeply disappointed a music-loving doctoral student when he told him: \"If you want to work scientifically, you have to give up your music!\" Hilb was also interested in literature and theatre. He was involved in the \"Society for Literature and Stage Art\" and promoted artistic projects.\nFelix Klein\nwas the driving force behind the\nEnzyklopädie der mathematischen Wissenschaften\nⓉ\n(\nEncyclopedia of Mathematical Sciences\n)\n, published between\n1898\nand\n1933\n. Hilb was an enthusiastic contributor to the encyclopaedia, writing the articles\nDifferentialgleichungen im komplexen Gebiet, Nichtlineare Differentialgleichungen\nⓉ\n(\nDifferential equations in the complex domain, nonlinear differential equations\n)\n(1916)\n,\n(\nwith\nMarcel Riesz\n)\nNeuere Untersuchungen über trigonometrische Reihen\nⓉ\n(\nRecent studies on trigonometric series\n)\n(1922)\nand\n(\nwith\nOtto Szász\n)\nAllgemeine Reihenentwicklung\nⓉ\n(\nGeneral series expansion\n)\n(1922)\n. Hilb also founded his own series of textbooks \"Mathematics and its applications in physics and technology\" published by the Academic Publishing Company Geest & Portig in Leipzig.\nHilb had been appointed as an extraordinary professor at the young age of\n27\nbut, ten years later, he had not found a position as an ordinary professor. Of course during these ten years,\n1909\n-\n1919\n, half were years of World War I\n(1914\n-\n18)\nand this produced great difficulties in the German university system. In\n1919\nMax Noether\nretired as the ordinary professor at Erlangen and the university sought to fill the vacancy. Hilb had strong hopes that he might succeed in the competition to fill this position since he knew he was highly regarded by\nMax Noether\nand others at Erlangen.\nErnst Fischer\nwas a professor at Erlanger and he suggested to the appointing committee that\nHeinrich Tietze\n,\nGustav Herglotz\n,\nWilhelm Blaschke\nand\nRichard Von Mises\nas the strongest candidates.\nMax Noether\nfelt that\nErnst Fischer\n, who was an Austrian, was favouring Austrian candidates over Germans, particularly over Hilb.\nMax Noether\nwrote to\nHilbert\n:-\nI now consider this to be wrong for our Germans\n(\nespecially Hilb\n)\n, and I would like to ask you cordially to let me know your judgment that I should be able to present to the Committee.\nMax Noether\nput\nHilbert\n's assessment to the appointing committee:-\nHilb is an authority in the vast field of oscillation theories and integral equations, and I have benefited from his ingenuity in this field until recently. He is also an excellent connoisseur of modern analysis in the broadest scope\n(\nreal function theory, set theory, etc.\n)\n, so that I would put him objectively in front of\nHellinger\nand not behind\nBlaschke\n,\nMises\n,\nTietze\n. ... I propose the ranking Hilb,\nTietze\n,\nHellinger\n.\nErnst Fischer\n's ideas prevailed, however, and\nTietze\nwas appointed. Hilb was very unhappy, particularly when he learnt of the objections against him put by the Erlangen appointing committee who were particularly critical of his teaching. He complained to the Ministry, asking them \"to compensate for the injustice inflicted on him.\" Initially, following an uncomfortable correspondence, the Ministry refused but on\n2\nApril\n1923\nthey awarded him the title of ordinary professor, but not the academic rights of that position. The Faculty of Arts at Würzburg applied again for Hilb to be awarded full academic rights in December\n1928\nand these were granted on\n16\nJanuary\n1929\n. Very sadly he had little chance to enjoy these rights since he died in August of that year.\nHilb died at the age of\n47\nafter his last years were marred by ill health. He had spells when he suffered from a kidney disease but his death was due to a stroke. He died in Würzburg but he was buried in the Pragfriedhof Jewish Cemetery in Stuttgart where both his parents were buried.\nOtto Haupt, Hilb's first doctoral student, gave a memorial speech in which he said\n[\n3\n]\n:-\nAnyone who knew Emil Hilb, even those who may have only met him briefly, is remembered as one of the most important things about him, his amiable and cheerful temperament. How much more difficult life would have been for him if his temperament had not helped him again and again over his worries, not least about the premonition of the illness that threatened him, which seems to have struck him more than once in his last years. And this cheerfulness of mind corresponded to a fundamentally benevolent being, who, even outside the family, always allowed him to take the warmest part in the state of health of his acquaintances and friends. We know how he was always ready with advice and action, how he made others' concerns his own concerns and did nothing better than give pleasure to others. We all also know what beautiful, intimate family life Hilb led, to which kind fate had given him a wife who was the most understanding companion.\nFinally we should say a few words about Hilb's wife Marianne and his daughters. In March\n1933\n, three and a half years after Hilb's death, Hitler came to power and began enacting his anti-Semitic legislation. In\n1937\n, with increasing difficulties for those of Jewish descent, the family moved from Seelbergstrasse\n5\nto a smaller flat in Würzburg where they lived with Gertrud Wolff, Marianne's mother. In November\n1938\naround\n1000\nSA paramilitary men raided Jewish houses and shops in Würzburg, robbing and destroying the contents. They devastated the Hilb's flat and Marianne filed a complaint for theft of valuables but, of course, this was simply a waste of time for the authorities were supporting the raids. Hilb's daughter Anneliese escaped to England in\n1939\nwhile in\n1940\nMarianne and her mother Gertrud moved to Frankfurt am Main where Irene was working as a secretary. On\n20\nMay\n1942\n, Marianne and Irene were deported ending up in the Treblinka concentration camp in German occupied Poland. They died there in\n1943\n. Gertrud Wolff was also deported but she was sent to the Theresienstadt concentration camp in German occupied Czechoslovakia. She died there on\n23\nAugust\n1942\n.",
