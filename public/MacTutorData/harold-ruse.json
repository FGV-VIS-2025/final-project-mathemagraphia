He remained at Leeds until he retired in\n1970\nat the age of\n65\n. From\n1948\nto\n1968\nhe was Head of the Department of Mathematics at Leeds, then for his final two years at Leeds he was Chairman of the School of Mathematics.\nRuse joined the\nEdinburgh Mathematical Society\nin January\n1927\n.
