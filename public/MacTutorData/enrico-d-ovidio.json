  "biografia": "Enrico D'Ovidio\n's parents were Pasquale D'Ovidio and Francesca Scaroina. They lived in Campobasso, in the Kingdom of the two Sicilies, under King Ferdinand II who had succeeded to the throne in\n1830\n. The D'Ovidio family were liberal, deeply involved in the Italian independence movement, and certainly found life much harder when, after the revolution of May\n1848\n, Ferdinand II turned against liberals. Enrico's brother Francesco D'Ovidio was born in Campobasso in December\n1849\n. Let us remark at this point that Francesco became a noted philologist becoming professor of Romance languages at the University of Naples.\n[\nAs an aside we note that Francesco's successor in the Naples chair was Silvio Pieri, the brother of Enrico's colleague\nMario Pieri\n.\n]\nEnrico's parents wanted the very best education for their sons and Enrico became a boarder at the Collegio Sannitico, attached to the Franciscan monastery, in Campobasso. In\n1858\nthe family moved from Campobasso to Naples to allow their two sons to have the best university education.\nIn Naples, Francesco studied at the Vittorio Emanuele\nGymnasium\nwhile Enrico, having completed his secondary education, was considering enrolling for a law degree. However, Enrico's uncle, Achille Sannia\n(\nborn Campobasso in\n1823\n, died in Naples in\n1892)\nhad set up a private mathematical school in Naples in\n1856\nand, under his influence and guidance, Enrico turned from legal studies to mathematics and began to study at Achille Sannia's school preparing for entry to the School of Bridges and Roads in Naples. He studied there for a time and attended lectures by\nGiuseppe Battaglini\n,\nEmanuele Fergola\n(1830\n-\n1915)\n, Remigio Del Grosso\n(1813\n-\n1876)\nand Fortunato Padula\n(1816\n-\n1881)\n, whose influence made D'Ovidio become interested in an academic career. However, the struggle for Italian independence in\n1860\n-\n61\n, which led to the defeat of Ferdinand II, caused considerable disruption to D'Ovidio's studies. Already at this time he was beginning original research in mathematics although he had not taken a standard university course. He wrote some short articles on\ndeterminants\nand\nconics\nand these were published in the early volumes of\nBattaglini\n's new journal\nGiornale di Matematiche\nwhich was founded in\n1863\n. In Volume\n1\n, he published five papers:\nDimostrazione di un teorema del capitano Faure\nⓉ\n(\nDemonstration of a theorem of Faure\n)\n;\nDue teoremi di determinanti\nⓉ\n(\nTwo theorems on determinants\n)\n;\nNota sopra un problema di geometria\nⓉ\n(\nNote on a geometry problem\n)\n;\nAlcune locali\nⓉ\n(\nSome loci\n)\n; and\nAltra dimostrazione dei teoremi provati a p.\n160\nⓉ\n(\nAnother demonstration of the theorems proved on p.\n160\n)\n. He continued publishing in\nGiornale di Matematiche\nwith three papers in\n1864\nin Volume\n2\n(\ntwo of which answered questions posed in the journal\n)\n, and two papers in the following year in Volume\n3\n(\none answered a question\n)\n.\nD'Ovidio began school teaching at the Umberto High School in Naples and he also taught at the Naval School. To make extra money he also gave private mathematics lessons. He was granted a degree \"ad honorem\" in mathematics by the University of Naples in\n1869\ndespite never having taken a degree course. He sat no written examination papers for this degree since it was felt that he had already proved his mathematical abilities. In\n1869\nD'Ovidio, in collaboration with Achille Sannia, published a geometry text for schools. The book\nElementi di geometria\nⓉ\n(\nElements of geometry\n)\nwas very popular and ran to fourteen editions\n(\nthe third edition was published in\n1876\n, the eighth in\n1891\n, and the fourteenth was published in\n1918)\n. In\n1872\nEugenio Beltrami\npersuaded him to enter the competition for the Chair of Algebra and Analytic Geometry at the University of Turin. This was a time of major change for the city of Turin which had been the capital of the unified Italy from\n1861\nbut Rome had become the capital in\n1870\nafter Italian troops entered the city. D'Ovidio was reluctant to leave the Naples area of Italy where he was close to his family but he decided to enter the competition and he was offered the chair on\n17\nNovember\n1872\n. D'Ovidio was to work for\n46\nyears in the University of Turin, retiring on\n11\nAugust\n1918\n. He was chairman of the Faculty of Science in\n1879\n-\n80\nand rector of the University between\n1880\nand\n1885\n. Another spell as chairman of the Faculty of Science between\n1893\nand\n1907\nended when he was appointed as a Commissioner of the Polytechnic of Turin. He held this position until\n1922\n.\nHe married Maria Bonacossa in the summer of\n1877\n; they had two daughters Pia and Laura, and a son who died in\n1907\nwhile hiking in the mountains, trying to hold back a friend who was falling. D'Ovidio became a leading figure in Italian mathematics and, as a consequence, often served as a referee for appointing competitions. We give just a few examples. In\n1890\nD'Ovidio was a referee for a post at the Polytechnic of Turin. There were\n24\ncandidates and Federico Amodeo was chosen for the post\n(\nMario Pieri\nwas placed second\n)\n. He was a referee, with\nEugenio Bertini\nand\nGiuseppe Veronese\n, for appointing the chair of analytic and projective geometry at the University of Rome in\n1891\n.\nGuido Castelnuovo\n, who was at that time D'Ovidio's assistant, was appointed to the chair. In\n1893\nhe was a referee for appointing the chair of projective and descriptive geometry at his own University of Turin;\nLuigi Berzolari\nwas appointed.\nEuclidean and non-Euclidean geometry were the areas of special interest to D'Ovidio. He published twenty-two works between\n1863\nto\n1872\n. These include:\nDimostrazione di alcuni teoremi sulle superfici sviluppabili di\n5\n° ordine enunciati dal professor Cremona\nⓉ\n(\nDemonstration of some theorems on developable surfaces of\n5\nth order set out by Professor Cremona\n)\n(1865)\n;\nNuova dimostrazione di una formula di Abel\nⓉ\n(\nNew proof of a formula of Abel\n)\n(1868)\n; and\nNota sui punti, piani e rette in coordinate omogenee\nⓉ\n(\nNote on points, planes and lines in homogeneous coordinates\n)\n(1870)\n. However, his most intense period of research occurred after he was first appointed to Turin. It was a highly significant time for research in geometry with the work by\nNikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky\n,\nJános Bolyai\nand\nBernhard Riemann\non non-Euclidean geometry becoming widely known and\nFelix Klein\nhad put forward the general view of Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometries as invariants for transformation groups in the 'Erlanger Programm' in\n1872\n. D'Ovidio built on the geometric ideas which these mathematicians had been introduced. His most important work is probably his paper of\n1877\n,\nLe funzioni metriche fondamentali negli spazi di quante si vogliano dimensioni e di curvatura costante\nⓉ\n(\nThe fundamental metric functions in spaces of how much you want to scale and constant curvature\n)\n. In this work the he used concepts and methods from projective geometry to derive the metric functions in non-Euclidean\nn\nn\nn\n-dimensional spaces, paving the way for subsequent work of\nGiuseppe Veronese\n,\nCorrado Segre\nand his other students.\nD'Ovidio also worked on binary forms, conics and\nquadrics\n. The importance of his work in this area is illustrated by the fact that his\n1880\npaper\nStudio sulle cubiche gobbe mediante la notazione simbolica delle forme binarie\nⓉ\n(\nStudy of the cubic humps using the symbolic notation of binary forms\n)\nwas awarded the gold medal by the\nNational Academy of Sciences of Italy\n(\nthe \"Academy of Forty\"\n)\n. He published a number of important books:\nLa proprietà fondamentale delle curve di secondo ordine studiate sulla equazione generale di secondo grado in coordinate cartesiane\nⓉ\n(\nThe fundamental property of the second order curves on the general equation of the second degree in Cartesian coordinates\n)\n(\nfirst edition\n1876\n, second edition\n1883)\n;\nTeoria analitica delle forme geometriche fondamentali\nⓉ\n(\nAnalytical theory of fundamental geometric forms\n)\n(1885)\n;\nGeometria analitica\nⓉ\n(\nAnalytical geometry\n)\n(\nfirst edition\n1885\n, fourth edition\n1912)\n;\nIl Io di Euclide esposto da E D'Ovidio\nⓉ\n(\nThe first book of Euclid expounded by E D'Ovidio\n)\n(\nfirst edition\n1887\n, third edition\n1894)\n; and\nIl libro IIo di Euclide esposto da E D'Ovidio\nⓉ\n(\nThe second book of Euclid expounded by E D'Ovidio\n)\n(1889)\n.\nHe had two very famous assistants,\nGiuseppe Peano\n(\nassistant in\n1880\n-\n83)\nand\nCorrado Segre\n(\nassistant in\n1883\n-\n84)\n. D'Ovidio and\nCorrado Segre\nbuilt an important school of geometry at Turin. For example, in\n1888\n, in addition to D'Ovidio and\nCorrado Segre\n, the faculty in Turin included\nGiuseppe Basso\n, Giuseppe Erba,\nAngelo Genocchi\n, Nicodemo Jadanza,\nGiuseppe Peano\n, and\nFrancesco Siacci\n. At this time\nMario Pieri\n,\nGuido Castelnuovo\nand Filiberto Castellano were assistants. One of D'Ovidio's greatest achievements was his outstanding support for the students and assistants under his care. In addition to\nGiuseppe Peano\n,\nCorrado Segre\n, Filiberto Castellano\n(1860\n-\n1919)\n(\nwho became his assistant in\n1881)\n, and\nGuido Castelnuovo\n(\nwho was his assistant in\n1888\n-\n91)\n, we should mention\nGino Fano\n(\nwho was his assistant in\n1892\n-\n93)\n,\nBeppo Levi\n(\nwho was his student\n1892\n-\n96)\n, and\nGino Loria\nwho earned his laurea in\n1883\nsupervised by D'Ovidio and also was his assistant in\n1884\n-\n86\n. When D'Ovidio retired in\n1918\n, Italy had just gone through the trauma of World War I. To coincide with his retirement\nScritti matematici offerti ad Enrico D'Ovidio\nⓉ\n(\nMathematical writings offered to Enrico D'Ovidio\n)\nwas published. The Preface, written by the editors\nFrancesco Gerbaldi\n(\nwho was also a student of D'Ovidio and then his assistant after\n1879)\nand\nGino Loria\n, begins\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nOn the approach of the day on which an inflexible law would retire Senator Enrico D'Ovidio from the university chair, there arose in the minds of many students whom he has had in his long and glorious career as a teacher, the pleasant idea of choosing this occasion - which coincides with his\n75\nth\nbirthday - to manifest to him their sentiments of unalterable affection and, at the same time, to present to him their sincere good wishes ad multos annos. ... And we are certain that to the loved teacher our publication will be doubly gratifying in as much as it serves also to show how Italy, in the tragic hours in which we live - not less than in the more grave and decisive periods of her earlier struggles for redemption - has not ceased to feed the sacred flame of science.\nThe author of\n[\n8\n]\nwrites:-\nIt is a pretty Italian custom to mark an epoch in the life of a great scholar, by presenting to him a set of scientific notes written by his friends in his honour. On the occasion of the retirement of Professor d'Ovidio from the chair at Turin, at the age of\n75\nand after\n46\nyears' service, the present volume is contributed by a distinguished company of nine former assistants, ten old students and one other friend of the veteran.\nL Wayland Dowling\nwrites\n[\n6\n]\n:-\nOf the\n103\npersons contributing to the expense of publication, and whose names appear directly following the preface,\n47\nhave been actual students under Professor D'Ovidio, and\n20\nhave been, at one time or another, directly associated with him as Assistenti in the University of Turin. The list contains many names well known to students of mathematics the world over, and bears witness to the great influence Professor D'Ovidio has had upon the growth of mathematics and upon the teaching of mathematics, not alone in Italy, but, mainly perhaps through his disciples, throughout the civilized world. This influence has been exerted from the University of Turin for more than forty years. ... Professor D'Ovidio's great influence has come about rather more through personal contact as a teacher than through published writings, and goes to show that there is such a thing as creative teaching as well as there is creative scholarship - a fact worth noting in a time when so much emphasis is placed upon the latter function and apparently so little is thought about the former. ...\n[\nWe have\n]\na feeling of profound admiration for the scholars who have made the book possible, and especially at a time when the strain of the war was still in force. ... The total is a wholly worthy epitome of scientific activity even in normal times. It must, indeed, be a source of great satisfaction to Professor D'Ovidio to have so distinct a proof of the esteem with which his many students, associates, and friends regard his long service and his personal qualifications as an inspiring teacher.\nMany honours came D'Ovidio's way. He was elected to the Accademia pontaniana of Naples on\n9\nFebruary\n1872\n, the\nTurin Academy of Sciences\non\n16\nJanuary\n1879\n(\nhe was elected president of the Academy and served in that role during\n1902\n-\n1910)\n, and the Istituto lombardo di scienze e lettere of Milan on\n10\nFebruary\n1881\n. He became a corresponding member of the Società reale of Naples on\n12\nFebruary\n1881\n, becoming a full member on\n12\nJune\n1909\n. He became a corresponding member of the\nAccademia dei Lincei\nin Rome on\n31\nDecember\n1883\n, becoming a full member on\n7\nNovember\n1893\n. He was elected to the\nNational Academy of Sciences of Italy\n(\nthe \"Academy of Forty\"\n)\nin December\n1884\nand in the same month to the Accademia delle scienze of Naples. In the following year he was elected to the Accademia nazionale di scienze, lettere ed arti of Modena. These were academic awards, but D'Ovidio also received a large number of honours from his country. He was made: Knight of the Order of the Crown of Italy on\n28\nMay\n1876\n; Officer of the Order of the Crown of Italy on\n15\nJanuary\n1882\n; Commander of the Order of the Crown of Italy on\n16\nJanuary\n1883\n; Grand Officer of the Order of the Crown of Italy on\n11\nJuly\n1918\n; Knight of the Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus on\n2\nJune\n1882\n; Officer of the Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus on\n5\nJune\n1892\n; Commander of the Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus on\n3\nJune\n1909\n; and Grand Officer of the Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus on\n2\nJuly\n1922\n.\nD'Ovidio also had a career in parliament. Kennedy writes in\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nHe was named a senator in March\n1905\n, but there were rumours that this was due to a mix-up and that the nomination was intended for his brother Francesco, the noted philologist, who was in fact named a senator a few months later.\nHe took his oath on\n7\nApril\n1905\nand, although he did not make a significant contribution to the parliament, he did make some important speeches on education and was involved in the discussions concerning the law that set up the Royal Polytechnic of Turin in\n1906\nby combining the already existing Regia Scuola\n(\nRoyal School\n)\nand the Regio Museo Industriale\n(\nRoyal Industrial Museum\n)\n.",
