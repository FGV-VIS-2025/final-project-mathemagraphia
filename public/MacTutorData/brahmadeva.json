  "summary": "Brahmadeva was an Indian mathematician who wrote a commentary on the work of Aryabhata I.",
  "biografia": "Brahmadeva\nwas the son of Candrabudha. The family came from the Mathura district of Uttar Pradesh in northern India. He was born into the Brahman caste which meant he was from the highest ranking caste of Hindu priests. The Brahman caste had a strong tradition of education so Brahmadeva would have received one of the best educations of men of his time.\nWe have only one work by Brahmadeva and this is\nKaranaprakasa\nwhich is a commentary on the\nAryabhatiya\nby\nAryabhata I\n. Brahmadeva's work is in nine chapters and it follows the contents of the original\nAryabhatiya.\nTopics covered include the longitudes of the planets, problems relating to the daily rotation of the heavens, eclipses of the sun and the moon, risings and settings, the lunar crescent, and conjunctions of the planets.\nThe work contains some contributions to trigonometry, motivated by its application to mathematical astronomy. It is this aspect of the work which is mentioned by Gupta in\n[\n2\n]\n.\nDifferent commentaries on the\nAryabhatiya\nachieved popularity in different parts of India. Brahmadeva's commentary seems to have been particularly popular in Madras, Mysore and Maharastra. The more important commentaries on the\nAryabhatiya\nbecame the basis for further commentaries and indeed this is what happened to the\nKaranaprakasa.\nCommentaries on Brahmadeva's work continued to appear up to the seventeenth century.",
