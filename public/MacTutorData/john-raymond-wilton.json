  "biografia": "John Raymond Wilton\nwas educated at Adelaide University where he was awarded a B.Sc. in\n1903\n. He then went to Cambridge University in England and he was fifth\nwrangler\nin the mathematical sciences tripos of\n1907\n, then took part of the natural sciences tripos in\n1908\n. He was an assistant lecturer in the Cavendish Laboratory, Cambridge, for the year\n1908\n-\n09\n, then Lecturer in mathematics at the University of Sheffield from\n1909\nto\n1919\n.\nPapers Wilton published during this period include:\nOn plane waves of sound\n(1913)\n;\nOn the highest wave in deep water\n(1913)\n;\nOn deep water waves\n(1914)\n;\nFigures of equilibrium of rotating fluid under the restriction that the figure is to be a surface of revolution\n(1914)\n;\nOn the potential and force function of an electrified spherical bowl\n(1914\n-\n15)\n;\nOn ripples\n(1915)\n;\nOn the solution of certain problems of two-dimensional physics\n(1915)\n;\nA pseudo-sphere whose equation is expressible in terms of elliptic functions\n(1915)\n; and\nA formula in zonal harmonics\n(1916\n-\n17)\n.\nHe returned to Australia where he was Professor of Mathematics at Adelaide University from\n1920\nuntil his death in\n1944\n.
