  "summary": "Louis Goodstein was an English mathematician who worked on mathematical logic, in particular ordinal numbers, recursive arithmetic, analysis, and the philosophy of mathematics.",
  "biografia": "Louis Goodstein\n's father was Alexander Goodstein. Educated at St Paul's School London, Louis won scholarships and a prize for an essay on divergent series. He entered Magdalene College Cambridge in\n1931\nand his special subject in his undergraduate course was analysis. He graduated with First Class honours in\n1933\n.\nGoodstein then did research at Cambridge on transfinite numbers under\nLittlewood\n's supervision. After receiving his Master's Degree he accepted a post in pure and applied mathematics at Reading University in\n1935\n. During the war years he had to cover teaching in a wide range of pure and applied mathematical topics, among them engineering, applied mathematics, analysis and\ngroup theory\n.\nWhile undertaking this strenuous teaching load Goodstein carried out research which he submitted for a doctorate to the University of London in\n1946\n. He was appointed professor at University College, Leicester, in\n1948\nand he remained there for the rest of his life. At Leicester\n[\n1\n]\n:-\n... he presided over an expansion from a mathematics staff of six to\n23\nat the time of his retirement in\n1977\n, with a corresponding increase in student numbers.\nAt Leicester Goodstein played a full role. He was Dean of Science at the critical time of the transition to full university status which occurred in\n1957\n. From\n1966\nto\n1969\nhe served as Pro-Vice-Chancellor to Leicester University.\nGoodstein worked on mathematical logic, in particular ordinal numbers, recursive arithmetic, analysis, and the philosophy of mathematics. He was extremely interested in the teaching of mathematics and\n[\n2\n]\nlists\n66\npapers which he published on teaching mathematics at both school and university level.\nHis eleven textbooks were, according to\n[\n2\n]\n:-\n... characterised by their clear style and ingenious methods to elucidate difficult points. He was disappointed that his mathematical analysis text ... which presented a novel approach to elementary differential and integral calculus ... did not find favour.\nIt is interesting to note that he was the first mathematical logician to hold a chair at a British University and he exercised an important influence on the development of this topic in the UK\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nA private and essentially shy person, Louis Goodstein will be remembered for great courtesy and generosity towards colleagues and students.\nWe should also note Goodstein's excellent work for the\nMathematical Association\n[\n1\n]\n:-\n... he was instrumental in arranging for the transfer of its library and later its headquarters to Leicester, and contributed nearly\n70\nnotes as well as hundreds of reviews to the Mathematical Gazette, which he sustained at a high academic level during his editorship from\n1956\nto\n1962\n.",
