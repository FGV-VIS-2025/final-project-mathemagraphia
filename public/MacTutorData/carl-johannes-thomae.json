  "biografia": "Carl Johannes Thomae\nwas born in Laucha\n(\nUnstrut\n)\n, which is about\n35\nkm south west of Halle. His father was Karl-August Thomae, the rector of a school in Laucha, and his mother was Emilie Gutsmuths. Carl Johannes was the eldest of his parents two children and was not expected to survive to adulthood. For the first four years of his life he was extremely frail but eventually he gained in strength and by the age of five he was able to enjoy a normal childhood.\nWhen he was five years old Thomae entered the primary school in Laucha. His father, as rector of a school, was an important figure in the town. When Thomae was nine years old his father became his teacher, giving him an excellent grounding to enter the\ngymnasium\n. He then entered the cathedral gymnasium in Naumburg\n(\nSaale\n)\nwhich is about\n10\nkm south of Laucha. His teacher at the gymnasium, Moritz Hülsen, saw what an outstanding pupil he had in Thomae and coached him with additional work beyond the usual course of study. Thomae's work in mathematics was quite outstanding and it won for him a scholarship which he was awarded from October\n1860\n.\nThomae entered the University of Halle in\n1861\n, which was essentially his local university. There he attended lectures by\nCarl Neumann\n, who was a\nprivatdozent\nat the time, on applied mathematics and also by\nEduard Heine\nwho was an ordinary professor. It was\nHeine\nwho had the greatest influence on Thomae, giving him a love for function theory which was to set the course of his research for the  whole of his career. In\n1862\nThomae, following the usual tradition of German students of his time, moved to study at another university. This time he chose to study at Göttingen beginning in the autumn. He would have taken courses by\nRiemann\n, but sadly\nRiemann\ncaught a heavy cold which turned to tuberculosis. His lectures were taken over by Schering and Thomae went on to undertake his doctoral studies supervised by Schering.\nAfter being awarded his doctorate in\n1864\n, Thomae went to Berlin where he studied\nelliptic functions\nwith\nWeierstrass\nfor two terms. After this he returned to his home town of Laucha and there worked on a number of mathematical papers. In\n1866\nhe submitted work\nOn the introduction of ideal numbers\nto the University of Göttingen as his\nhabilitation\nand began lecturing there.\nIn June\n1866\na  war broke out between Austria and Prussia. It was a war which was sought by Bismarck who used as a pretext a dispute over the administration of Schleswig and Holstein. Austria and Prussia had captured this from Denmark in\n1864\nand jointly administered it for two years. Military preparations began fairly early in\n1866\nand hostilities broke out in the middle of June. Thomae took part in the campaign in Bohemia, where the main Prussian armies met the main Austrian forces. Thomae took part in three battles in this short campaign, the most decisive being the Battle of Königgrätz on\n3\nJuly. The war ended on\n23\nAugust with the signing of the Treaty of Prague. The Prussian victory resulted in Austria's exclusion from Germany as Bismarck had intended. After the Seven Weeks' War\n(\nas this short war is called\n)\nThomae returned to Göttingen and gave a lectures on determinants and on the differential and integral calculus.\nIn\n1867\nThomae was appointed as a privatdozent at Halle where he became a colleague of\nHeine\nand\nCantor\n. He submitted another habilitation thesis, this time containing two works:\nDe propositione quadam Riemanniana in analysi\nⓉ\n(\nOn the Riemannian proposition in the analysis\n)\nand\nÜber die Differentialgleichungen für die Module der Abelschen Integrale\nⓉ\n(\nOn the differential equations for the modules of Abelian integrals\n)\n. While he worked as a privatdozent at Halle, major changes were taking place in Prussia. Prussia led the German states to victory over France in the Franco-Prussian War of\n1870\n-\n71\nand in\n1871\nthe German Reich\n(\nGerman Empire\n)\n, with William I of Prussia as its emperor, came into existence.\nThomae was promoted to extraordinary professor at Halle in\n1872\nand two years later he moved to the University of Freiburg where he was appointed as ordinary professor. The vacancy arose since\nPaul du Bois-Reymond\n, who held the chair at Freiburg from\n1870\nto\n1874\n, had moved to the chair at the University of Tübingen where he succeeded\nHankel\n. Also in\n1874\nThomae married Anna Uhde in Balgstädt near his home town of Laucha; their son Walter was born on\n5\nNovember of the following year. At this point a great tragedy struck the family, for Anna died five days after Walter was born.\nAfter spending five years at Freiburg, Thomae moved to Jena in\n1879\nwhen he accepted the chair there. At Jena he became a colleague of\nGottlob Frege\nwho had been appointed as a privatdozent at Freiburg four years earlier. Both Thomae and\nFrege\nspent the rest of their careers at Freiburg. The relationship between Thomae and\nFrege\nis an interesting one. Scientifically they were vehemently opposed; their dispute was a public one carried out in the pages of the\nJahresberichte der Deuschen Mathematiker-Vereinigung\n. We will look at the issues involved in this dispute below. On the personal side Dathe\n[\n2\n]\nclaims their relations were quite friendly. Gabriel's evidence\n[\n4\n]\n, however, may suggest that their scientific dispute spilled over into their personal relations.\nThomae was Dean of the Philosophy Faculty in\n1884\n,\n1891\n,\n1898\n, and for a fourth time in\n1905\n. He was also elected Rector of the university in\n1901\n. Thomae married for a second time in\n1892\n. His marriage in Jena to Sophie Pröpper gave him a second child, this time a daughter Susanne born in\n1893\n. Susanne went on to become a singing teacher, while his son Walter studied the theory of art. Thomae retired in\n1914\nbut continued to publish papers up to\n1919\n. He died in\n1921\nafter a short illness.\nThe approach of both\nRiemann\nand\nWeierstrass\nstrongly influenced Thomae's study of function theory. One of Thomae's first papers is\nDie allgemeine Transformation der Thetafunktionen mit beliebig vielen Variablen\nⓉ\n(\nThe general transformation of theta functions with any number of variables\n)\n(1864)\n. He also published the text\nTheorie der ultraelliptischen Funktionen und Integrale erster und zweiter Ordnung\nⓉ\n(\nTheory of ultra elliptic functions and integrals first and second order\n)\n(1865)\n. An important formula, which is still often used today, is Thomae's formula which expresses branch points of hyperelliptic curves in terms of hyperelliptic theta constants. This first appeared in\nBestimmung von d lg  θ\n(0\n,\n0\n, ... ,\n0)\ndurch die Classenmoduln\nⓉ\n(\nDetermination of d lg θ\n(0\n,\n0\n, ...,\n0)\nby the class modules\n)\n(1866)\nand is also studied in his important paper\nBeitrag zur Bestimmung von  θ\n(0\n,\n0\n, ... ,\n0)\ndurch die Klassenmoduln algebraischer Funktionen\nⓉ\n(\nContribution to the determination of θ\n(0\n,\n0\n, ...,\n0)\nby the class moduli of algebraic functions\n)\n(1870)\n. Both of these two papers were published in\nCrelle's Journal\n. In the second of the papers Thomae also showed that the roots of a polynomial can be expressed in terms of hyperelliptic theta functions. Also in\n1870\nhe produced the first examples which show that joint continuity of a function\nf\n:\nR\nn\n→\nR\nf : \\mathbb{R}^{n}  \\to \\mathbb{R}\nf\n:\nR\nn\n→\nR\ndoes not follow from separate continuity. He also discovered methods of solving difference equations giving solutions in the form of definite integrals. Thomae was the first to attempt to introduce \"trans-Archimedean numbers\" but\nCantor\nargued that these were unworthy of the name of magnitude or quantity. He is also famed for the introduction of the Thomae θ-gamma function.\nCantor\nhad discovered that the points in\nn\nn\nn\n-dimensional space could be put in\n1\n-\n1\ncorrespondence with the line. In a letter of\n1877\nto\nDedekind\nhe said:-\nI see it but I don't believe it\n.\nThis was published in\n1878\nbut since the correspondence was not continuous many attempts to prove the invariance of dimension using continuity were made. Thomae was the first to attempt a general proof of the invariance of dimension but it was not satisfactory since the necessary topological tools had not been developed at this time. Thomae's proof, published in August\n1878\n, was criticized at the time because of its unwarranted assumption of a decomposition property.\nThomae's textbook\nElementare Theorie der analytischen Funktionen einer komplexen Veränderlichen\nⓉ\n(\nElementary theory of analytic functions of a complex variable\n)\npublished in\n1880\ncontained an introduction to arithmetic that fitted together and extended many earlier ideas. He begins his textbook with the statement that:-\n... the whole of pure mathematics is concerned with relations between numbers.\nHe then went to construct the rational numbers using Weierstrass's approach, then continued with a construction of the real numbers using the\nCauchy\nsequence type of definition already published by\nCantor\nand\nHeine\n. Only the positive integers had a concrete existence, while all other numbers were interpreted as signs. Following\nHankel\n's ideas, Thomae wrote in his book that these numbers should be:-\n... viewed as pure schemes without content\n[\nwhose\n]\nright to exist\n[\ndepended on the fact\n]\nthat the rules of combination abstracted from calculations with integers may be applied to them without contradiction.\nFrege\n, Thomae's colleague, strongly opposed these remarks. He held the opposite view to Thomae, and tried to set up arithmetic on a purely logical basis. In the second edition of his textbook published in\n1890\n, Thomae tried to address the concern's of his colleague while still believing in his type of approach. He greatly extended the chat at the beginning of the book presenting the \"formal arithmetic\" approach which he summarised as follows:-\nThe formal conception of numbers requires of itself more modest limitations than does the logical conception. It does not ask, what are and what shall the numbers be, but it asks, what does one require of numbers in arithmetic. For the formal conception, arithmetic is a game with signs which one may call empty; by this one wants to say that\n(\nin the game of calculation\n)\nthey have no other content than that which has been attributed to them concerning their behaviour with respect to certain rules of combination\n(\nrules of the game\n)\n. Similarly a chess player uses his pieces, he attributes to them certain properties which condition their behaviour in the game, and the pieces themselves are only external signs for this behaviour. To be sure, there is an important difference between the game of chess and arithmetic. The rules of chess are arbitrary; the system of rules for arithmetic is such that by means of simple axioms the numbers can be related to intuitive manifolds, so that they are of essential service in the knowledge of nature. - The formal standpoint relieves us of all metaphysical difficulties, that is the benefit it offers to us.\nFrege\ndid not calm down, however, and became even more vehemently opposed to Thomae's point of view. Some of\nFrege\n's sarcastic and biting criticisms of Thomae's approach are quoted in\n[\n9\n]\n, see also\n[\n4\n]\n.\nThomae's final four papers are\nDie Liebmannsche Formel für das Ponceletsche Dreieck\nⓉ\n(\nThe Lie formula for the Poncelet triangle\n)\n(1918)\n,\nÜber die harmonischen Kovarianten zweier Kegelschnitte\nⓉ\n(\nOn the harmonic covariates of two conics\n)\n(1918)\n,\nDie harmonische Kovariante zweiter Art für zwei Kegelschnitte mit vier reellen Schnittpunkten\nⓉ\n(\nThe harmonious covariate of the second kind of two conic sections with four real intersections\n)\n(1919)\n, and\nÜber die Cassinischen Kurven\nⓉ\n(\nOn the Cassini curves\n)\n(1919)\n.",
