  "biografia": "Alfonso Nápoles\nhad the full name of\nAlfonso Antonio de Jesús Nápoles Gándara\nbut was usually known as\nAlfonso Nápoles Gándara\n. He was the son of José Antonio Nápoles León\n(\nborn\n1864)\nand Josefa Gándara Ayala\n(\nborn\n1868)\n. Antonio Nápoles, the son of Francisco Nápoles and Maria Narcisa Leon, married Josefa Gándara, the daughter of Hesíquio Gándara and Felipa Ayala, in Cuernavaca, Morelos, Mexico on\n22\nMay\n1891\n. They had five children: María Esther Nápoles Gándara\n(\nborn\n22\nApril\n1892)\n; Francisco Antonio Nápoles Gándara\n(\nborn\n14\nJanuary\n1895)\n; Alfonso Nápoles Gándara\n(\nborn\n14\nOctober\n1897)\n, the subject of this biography; Margarita Asunción Nápoles Gándara\n(\nborn\n20\nJuly\n1899)\n; and Carlos Nápoles Gándara\n(\nborn\n4\nNovember\n1901)\n, All five children were born in Cuernavaca, the main city of the state of Morelos, situated about\n60\nkm due south of Mexico City.\nAlfonso Nápoles was baptised on\n28\nOctober\n1897\nin the Church of Sagrario in Cuernavaca.\nAlfonso entered the National Preparatory School in\n1910\n. This school, originally a Jesuit College in the centre of Mexico City, was taken over by the government in\n1868\nand brought pupils up to the standard required for entering the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México. Alfonso began his studies there at a difficult time for the Mexican Revolution began in the year he entered. In his home city of Cuernavaca, Emiliano Zapata Salazar\n(1879\n-\n1919)\nwas the main leader of the Mexican Revolution in the State of Morelos and led the revolutionaries known as the Zapatistas. The Mexican Revolution, essentially a civil war with foreign involvement\n(\nparticularly from the United States\n)\n, lasted from\n1910\nto\n1920\n. Tragedy struck the Nápoles family on\n20\nJuly\n1912\nwhen Francisco Nápoles, Alfonso's elder brother, was one of\n82\npeople killed when a train going from Cuernavaca was attacked by the Zapatistas between the stations of \"Cima\" and \"Fierro del Toro\", on the slopes of Ajusco. Alfonso completed his studies at the National Preparatory School in\n1915\nand in\n1916\nentered the National School of Engineers, part of the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México.\nWhile a student at the National Preparatory School, Nápoles fell in love with mathematics. It was his mathematics teacher\nSotero Prieto\nwho inspired him. After he began studying at the National School of Engineers he was again taught mathematics by\nSotero Prieto\nand Nápoles knew that he wanted a career teaching mathematics. In\n1920\nhe began teaching mathematics in secondary schools in Mexico City while continuing to study at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México. In\n1921\nhe became a professor of mathematics in the National School of Engineers. From\n1923\nhe took courses in the School of Advanced Studies where he took courses such as Philosophy taught by Antonio Caso, Adolescent Psychology taught by Ezequiel Chávez, Educational Philosophy also taught by Ezequiel Chávez, School Organisation taught by Moisés Sáez, and Mathematics taught by\nSotero Prieto\n. Nápoles taught at the National Preparatory School becoming head of mathematics there in\n1926\n.\nAlberto Barajas\nentered the National Preparatory School in\n1930\nand had Nápoles as his mathematics teacher.\nBarajas\nwrites\n[\n23\n]\n:-\nHe was a very good presenter, very well organised. I always attended his class with great pleasure. ... Nápoles walked very straight, very fast and I don't think I've ever met anyone who managed the blackboard area like he did. Simply by attending his class one learned what was needed. He compared very favourably with the mathematics teachers I had been given in high school.\nThe course that\nBarajas\nwas taking with Nápoles was, however, cut short\n[\n11\n]\n:-\nOne day we began to notice him nervous and worried, then he announced that the course would have to be shortened and the final examination would be in August. From the newspapers we learned the cause of his concern: he had just been awarded a Guggenheim fellowship to pursue higher studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He was the first Mexican mathematician to obtain such an honour. From that moment, our respect for him took a quantum leap.\nNápoles applied for the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation fellowship since he had been advised and encouraged to do so by\nSotero Prieto\n. The award of the fellowship is reported in\n[\n20\n]\n:-\nThe Committee of Selection in Mexico for the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation takes great pleasure in announcing that, upon its nomination and recommendation, the Trustees of the Foundation have appointed Mr Alfonso Nápoles Gándara and Dr Arturo Rosenblueth Stearns to the first Latin American Fellowships granted by the Foundation in Mexico. The Committee of Selection in Mexico ... received some\n50\napplications for the two fellowships offered by the Guggenheim Foundation for the year\n1930\n. These applications came from various States of the Republic and represented almost every field of intellectual endeavour. The attainments and plans for study of many of the applicants  were of the highest type and the committee was able to make its final selections only after a great deal of difficult study and comparison. After a careful consideration of each case, however, the committee was unanimous in the opinion that the greatest contributions, in line with the purposes of the Foundation, would be made by Doctor Rosenblueth and Mr Nápoles.\nMore detail of Nápoles' proposed plans are given in\n[\n21\n]\n:-\nThe object of Doctor Nápoles' fellowship will be to permit him to engage in a study of higher mathematics in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and to pursue further study in the principles of pedagogy and methods of teaching mathematics in secondary schools. Doctor Nápoles has had many years' experience as teacher of mathematics in the secondary schools of Mexico City and is at present professor of that subject in the College of Engineering of the National University of Mexico.\nJosé Adem\nspoke about this in his speech\n[\n18\n]\n:-\nHighly impressed with the large number of innovative courses that he found at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and at Harvard University, many of them never before studied in Mexico, Nápoles Gándara set himself the goal of learning as many subjects as possible in order to bring them to our country. In just\n18\nmonths and through an extraordinary effort, he managed to internalise himself in a large number of topics, including Mathematical Analysis, Differential Geometry, Tensor Calculus,\nFourier\nSeries and the Theory of Functions. The lectures that he gave upon his return became the main basis for training a group of young higher mathematics teachers, which would later constitute the physical-mathematical faculty of our Faculty of Sciences.\nFrom September\n1930\nto January\n1932\nNápoles studied fourteen graduate level courses at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology including Differential Geometry, Tensor Calculus\n(\nAbsolute Differential Calculus\n)\n, Riemannian Geometry, Differential Equations\n(\nadvanced course\n)\n,\nFourier\nSeries, Calculus of Variations, Probability Theory, Real Variable Functions, Algebraic and Projective Geometry. He also took courses on Functions of Complex Variables and Mathematics Teaching Methods at Harvard University.\nJosé Adem\nsaid in his speech\n[\n18\n]\n:-\nParallel to teaching, research began to be organised when in\n1932\n, and at the initiative of a group headed by\nSotera Prieto\n, Nápoles Gándara, Jorge Quijano and Mariano Hernández, the Section of Mathematics and Theoretical Physics was formed at the Antonio Alzate National Academy of Sciences. The weekly sessions that were held for several years were one of the first stimuli received by mathematical research in Mexico. Several professors participated in this mathematical seminar, as well as a group of distinguished students of\nSotera Prieto\nand Nápoles Gándara.\nNápoles himself recognised the importance of the Section of Mathematics and Theoretical Physics and wrote\n[\n26\n]\n:-\nIt was an escape valve for some distinguished professors and students in the exact sciences. Like an oasis in the aridity of the environment. There they were able to present some original research papers in physics and mathematics, and develop several topics of higher study in both disciplines. A new, promising era for physics and mathematics was beginning.\nWhile at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Nápoles had become friends with\nDirk Struik\n. Realising the importance of foreign contacts for those researching in the Section of Mathematics and Theoretical Physics, Nápoles requested the Ministry of Education Public to invite\nStruik\nto visit Mexico. This was an important move for up until that time no leading foreign mathematicians had gone to Mexico.\nStruik\nvisited in\n1934\nand gave lectures on tensor calculus and probability theory to the Antonio Alzate Academy of Sciences.\nSotero Prieto\n, who had taught and inspired Nápoles, was undoubtedly the leading mathematician in Mexico at this time but tragically he committed suicide on\n22\nMay\n1935\n. This meant that, for thirty years from\n1935\nto\n1965\n, Nápoles became the leading figure in Mexican mathematics. It was through the efforts of Nápoles that, towards the end of\n1938\n, the Faculty of Sciences was created in the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México. Also through his efforts, the Institute of Mathematics was founded on\n30\nJune\n1942\n. He was appointed as its first director and remained the director from\n1942\nto\n1966\nalthough during\n1964\nRoberto Vázquez\nacted as Director for a few months while Nápoles was on sabbatical leave.\nThe Institute of Mathematics began to operate in the Palacio de Minería, in the historic centre of Mexico City. The building also housed the National School of Engineers and the recently founded Faculty of Sciences. The Institute was subdivided into three areas: Pure Mathematics, led by by\nAlberto Barajas\nand\nRoberto Vázquez\n, Applied Mathematics, led by\nCarlos Graef\n, and Logic and Fundamentals led by Francisco Zubieta. These four young researchers and the director Alfonso Nápoles were the only members of the Institute's academic staff when it was founded. One of the most important functions of the Institute under Nápoles' leadership was the bringing of foreign mathematicians to work and lecture there. Particularly important for Mexican mathematics was the many visits of\nGeorge D Birkhoff\nand\nSolomon Lefschetz\nbetween\n1944\nand\n1966\n.\nAlthough Nápoles was the leading Mexican mathematician from\n1935\n, he had no mathematics degrees. In\n1939\n, he obtained a master's degree in Physical Sciences and Mathematics, awarded by the Ministry of Education. In\n1940\nhe was awarded a doctorate in mathematics conferred by the National Autonomous University of Mexico. It is worth noting that Nápoles did not want to receive the doctorate but in the end accepted it feeling that it was good for Mexican mathematics. The doctoral diploma is dated\n28\nNovember\n1940\n.\nManuela Garín\nwas involved in finding and restoring the diploma after the death of Nápoles and a ceremony was held in celebration, see\n[\n12\n]\n.\nThe First National Congress of Mathematics was held in the city of Saltillo, Mexico, in November\n1942\n, organised by Alfonso Nápoles Gándara,\nAlberto Barajas\nand Francisco José Alvarez. At this Congress, a commission was set up consisting of the three organisers of the congress together with\nCarlos Graef\n, which was given the task of setting up the\nMexican Mathematical Society\n. At the first meeting of the Society on\n30\nJune\n1943\n, Alfonso Nápoles Gándara was elected as the first president of the Society and\nCarlos Graef\nwas elected the first vice-president from\n1943\nto\n1945\n. Nápoles was President of the\nMexican Mathematical Society\nfrom its founding in\n1943\nuntil\n1955\n, and then again from\n1957\nto\n1961\n. In\n1961\nhe was made an Honorary President for Life.\nAlfonso Nápoles married Guadalupe Salazar Espinosa de Los Monteros on\n22\nDecember\n1948\nin Mexico City. Guadalupe, the daughter of Mariano Salazar and Guadalupe Espinosa de Los Montero, had been born in Puebla, Mexico, on\n18\nMarch\n1900\n. They had one son, Alfonso Nápoles Salazar, who became an architect and a Professor of Architecture at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México.\nSantiago Ramirez writes in\n[\n26\n]\n:-\nNápoles published little, had few disciples, his life has an anticlimactic taste, there are no great deeds, there are no great acts of heroism. It was a thankless job: organising, raising money, convincing the authorities of the time that mathematics existed. In a way, life, the long life of Nápoles, had a taste of sadness, of loneliness, of an inner conviction that is proof against any bureaucratic obstacle that might arise, an inner conviction that one day we would be here as we are today.\nAlthough he published little, Nápoles did publish three volumes of the book\nAlgebra elemental para escuelas secundarias\nⓉ\n(\nElementary Algebra for Secondary Schools\n)\nwhich was very popular and ran to several editions.\nNápoles received a number of honours for his outstanding contributions to Mexican mathematics. In\n1953\nthe Autonomous University of the State of Morelos awarded him an honorary doctorate, in\n1956\nthe Benito Juárez Autonomous University of Oaxaca awarded him an extraordinary professorship and in\n1965\nhe received the distinction of emeritus researcher from the National Autonomous University of Mexico. He was awarded a prize by the National University in\n1987\nfor his Teaching in Exact Sciences.\nLet us end by quoting Nápoles' own thoughts about mathematics as given in\n[\n3\n]\n:-\n... mathematics is a very abstract science and difficult; being difficult in general is not very attractive for the students.\n[\nHowever\n]\nmathematics exercises the mind and helps the student to reason and decide correctly. But not everyone realises this. Know to foresee and foresee to act. The one who is going to act must foresee, but in order to foresee, one must know. A person who studies mathematics, due to its structure and practice of logic, acquires greater abilities to predict than those who do not study it. Those who study mathematics are taught to reason correctly, for that is its main purpose. As I have told my students: it doesn't matter if you forget the name of the theorem and what it consists of; but by studying it they understood and exercised reasoning. It is an intellectual exercise that when it is done it leaves its mark.",
