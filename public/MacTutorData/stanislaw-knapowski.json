  "biografia": "Stanisław Knapowski\n's mother was Zifia Krysiewicz and his father was Roch Knapowski who, at the time of Stanisław's birth, was a lawyer in Poznań but was later professor at Poznań University. Stanisław was brought up in Poznań until the Second World War began. Hitler declared war on Poland on\n31\nAugust\n1939\nand the German attack began on\n1\nSeptember. The German armies rapidly overcame the Polish resistance with Warsaw surrendering on\n27\nSeptember and all Polish resistance came to an end on\n6\nOctober. The Knapowski family were now living in an occupied country.\nThe occupying German forces expelled thousands of the Polish people from the west of the country and the Knapowskis were forced to settle in the Kielce province in south-eastern Poland. Four German extermination camps were located in Kielce and young Stanisław grew up there in very difficult circumstances. After the war ended in\n1945\nefforts were made to allow displaced people to return to their homes, and the Knapowskis returned to Poznań where Stanisław attended the local\ngymnasium\n, excelling in mathematics. He completed his school education in\n1949\nand at that time entered Poznań University to continue his study of mathematics. In\n1952\nKnapowski went to Wrocław University to continue his studies. He was appointed as an assistant at Wrocław while still an undergraduate, being awarded his master's degree in\n1954\n.\nKnapowski returned to the Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznań where he was appointed as an assistant. He also worked under\nWładysław Orlicz\ntowards his doctorate but was greatly influenced by\nTurán\n. This came about in September\n1956\nwhen\nTurán\ngave a series of lectures on a new analytic method in Lublin. Turán writes\n[\n4\n]\n:-\n[\nKnapowski\n]\ncame to Lublin and in several conversations I realised his quick and deep understanding. We spoke much on possible applications of the method in analytic number theory.\nIndeed this is precisely what Knapowski began to work on and he obtained his doctorate in\n1957\nfrom the Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznań for his thesis\nZastosowanie metod Turaná w analitycznej teorii liczb\nⓉ\n(\nApplications of Turán's methods in analytic number theory\n)\n. After this Knapowski went abroad. His first visit was to England where he spent just under a year working in Cambridge. He worked closely with\nMordell\nand attended courses by\nCassels\nand\nIngham\n. He continued his continental tour making shorter visits to other British universities and then universities in Belgium, France and Holland.\nBack in the Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznań Knapowski submitted his\nhabilitation\nthesis\nOn new \"explicit formulae\" in prime number theory\nwhich was published in\nActa Arithmetica\nin\n1960\n.\nTurán\nwas one of Knapowski's examiner's for his habilitation. Two years later the\nPolish Mathematical Society\nawarded him their\nMazurkiewicz\nPrize. During the academic year\n1962\n-\n63\nhe taught at Tulane University in New Orleans, USA, returning to Poland during\n1963\n. However, just over a year later, he left Poland and began teaching at a number of universities in Germany and the United States. In particular he taught at Marburg in Germany and Gainesville and Miami in the United States.\nKnapowski died when only\n36\nyears old\n[\n4\n]\n:-\nHe apparently lost control of his car when returning from the airport in Miami ...\nDespite his short mathematical career, Knapowski published\n53\npaper, mostly in algebra and number theory. Eighteen of these papers were written jointly with Turán. In\n[\n4\n]\nTurán writes of their collaboration:-\nMost of the time our mathematical connection was by correspondence. Though this was mainly mathematical, his style and even handwriting indicated from the very beginning his highly cultured personality. This impression was confirmed by personal contact. With the assistance of the\nPolish Academy of Sciences\nhe made longer visits to Hungary; we met on my short visits to Poland ... But also we met each other at some Western universities; particularly fruitful years were the summers of\n1963\nand\n1964\nat Ann Arbor and Columbus, Ohio. The long talks during evening strolls, whose main theme was mathematics and especially the further course of our joint work, was intermingled with discussions on music, literature and life, discussion which carefully concealed the serious behind jokes and usually ended, before returning home, at a student-association building with piano where he played Chopin and Liszt attracting a large audience. Car driving was one of his main hobbies; we made large excursions by car and according to my experience he was a safe driver\n(\napart from a single occasion\n)\n. It certainly did not occur to me that this will be fatal for him.\nTwo areas of number theory which received particular attention from Knapowski were the distribution of primes in different residue classes modulo\nk\nk\nk\n, and the sign changes in the remainder term in the prime number formula. Before indicating his contribution to the second of these areas we give some background.\nOn experimental evidence, after extensive calculation,\nLegendre\nin\n1798\nand\nGauss\nin\n1793\n(\naccording to a letter he wrote\n50\nyears later\n)\nsuggested that for large\nn\nn\nn\nthe density of primes behaves like the function\n1\nlog\n⁡\n(\nn\n)\n\\large\\frac{1}{\\log(n)}\\normalsize\nl\no\ng\n(\nn\n)\n1\n​\n.\nGauss\n's estimate, the logarithmic integral\nli\n(\nn\n)\n=\n∫\nd\nt\nlog\n⁡\n(\nt\n)\n(n) = \\int   \\large\\frac{dt}{\\log(t)}\\normalsize\n(\nn\n)\n=\n∫\nl\no\ng\n(\nt\n)\nd\nt\n​\nwhere the integral is evaluated at\nt\n=\nn\nt = n\nt\n=\nn\n, also fits the distribution. Let\nπ\n(\nn\n)\n\\pi(n)\nπ\n(\nn\n)\nbe the number of primes less than\nx\nx\nx\nand let\nΔ\n(\nn\n)\n=\nπ\n(\nn\n)\n−\n\\Delta (n) = \\pi(n) -\nΔ\n(\nn\n)\n=\nπ\n(\nn\n)\n−\nli\n(\nn\n)\n(n)\n(\nn\n)\n.\nRiemann\nconjectured in\n1859\nthat\nΔ\n(\nn\n)\n\\Delta (n)\nΔ\n(\nn\n)\nwas always negative, a result disproved by\nLittlewood\nin\n1914\n. However, only in\n1955\ndid Skewes give an upper bound for the smallest value of\nn\nn\nn\nfor which\nΔ\n(\nn\n)\n\\Delta (n)\nΔ\n(\nn\n)\nbecame positive. However, no lower bound was known at that time. It was Knapowski who went much further and investigated\nV\n(\nN\n)\nV(N)\nV\n(\nN\n)\nthe number of times\nΔ\n(\nn\n)\n\\Delta (n)\nΔ\n(\nn\n)\nchanges sign in the interval\nΔ\n(\nn\n)\n\\Delta (n)\nΔ\n(\nn\n)\n. His first paper on this topic\nOn sign changes of the difference\nπ\n(\nx\n)\n−\n\\pi(x) -\nπ\n(\nx\n)\n−\nli\n(\nx\n)\n(x)\n(\nx\n)\nappeared in\nActa Arithmetica\nin\n1962\n.\nAmong Knapowski's other number theory papers we mention:\nOn prime numbers in arithmetical progression\n(1958)\n,\nOn the Möbius function\n(1958)\n,\nContributions to the theory of the distribution of prime numbers in arithmetical progressions\n(1961\n,\n1962)\n,\nOn Linnik's theorem concerning exceptional L-zeros\n(1961)\n, and\nFurther developments in the comparative prime number theory\n(8\npapers\n)\n. He also wrote on other mathematical topics such as\nOn some criteria for indecomposability of polynomials\n(1955)\nand\nA theorem from finite group theory\n(1956)\n.",
