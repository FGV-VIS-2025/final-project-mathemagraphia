  "biografia": "Donald McIntosh\nwas educated first at the parish school in Tomintoul, then at Keith Grammar School and finally at Aberdeen Grammar School before entering the University of Aberdeen. He graduated with an M.A. in\n1890\nand, in the same year, was appointed as a Teacher at George Watson's Boys' College in Edinburgh. He taught there until\n1899\nwhen he was appointed as Head of Mathematics at Edinburgh Ladies' College.\nIn\n1918\nMcIntosh was appointed Director of Education for Moray, working from the County Education Office in Elgin. In\n1932\nthe administrations of Moray and Nairn were combined and McIntosh took over as Director of Education for Moray and Nairn, based in Tomintoul, Banffshire. He reached the age of sixty-five in the following year and retired. He then went to live in Glenavon, Boat-of-Garten, Invernesshire.\nWe have explained that McIntosh served as Head of Mathematics at Edinburgh Ladies' College, but mathematics was not his only academic interest.

He undertook research in marine zoology and was awarded a D.Sc. from the University of Aberdeen in\n1912\nafter submitting a thesis\nStudies on Echinodermata and on Variation\n.\nMcIntosh was a member of the\nEdinburgh Mathematical Society\n, joining in December\n1895\n. He continued as a member throughout his career. He served the Society as secretary from\n1899\nto\n1904\nand was then honoured by being elected as president for session\n1905\n-\n06\n.
