  "summary": "Hans Fitting was a German mathematician who is well-known for his results in group theory and Lie algebras.",
  "biografia": "Hans Fitting\n's father, Prof Dr Friedrich Fitting\n(1862\n-\n1945)\n, was a graduate secondary school teacher and a research mathematician who published over twenty papers. His doctorate was from the Martin-Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg in\n1888\nfor the thesis\nÜber eine Klasse von Berührungstransformationen\nⓉ\n(\nOn a class of contact transformations\n)\n.\nAlbert Wangerin\nhad been his thesis advisor. Friedrich Fitting is best known today for giving a proof, in\n1931\n, that there are exactly\n880\nmagic squares\nof order\n4\n. This result appears in his paper\nRein mathematische Behandlung des Problems der magischen Quadrate von\n16\nund von\n64\nFeldern\nⓉ\n(\nPure mathematical treatment of the problem of magic squares of\n16\nand\n64\nsquares\n)\nand is remarkable since these\n880\nmagic squares had been given by\nFrenicle de Bessy\nin\n1693\nbut no proof was found until Friedrich Fitting's\n1931\npaper appeared. He taught his son Hans in school and was thus able to quickly recognize his son's extraordinary mathematical talent. With his father's challenge to his understanding of the subject, Hans soon progressed far beyond what was customary for his age.\nFrom\n1925\nto\n1932\nFitting studied mathematics, physics and philosophy at the Universities of Tübingen and Göttingen, where he was awarded his Ph.D. in\n1932\nfor his work on group theory. His thesis advisor at Göttingen was\nEmmy Noether\n.\nWolfgang Krull\nand\nEmmy Noether\nhad proposed the task of classifying the structure of automorphism rings in a general theory of generalized abelian groups, that is abelian groups with operators. Fitting achieved this in his dissertation\nZur Theorie der Automorphismenringe Abelscher Gruppen und ihr Analogon bei nichtkommutativen Gruppen\nⓉ\n(\nOn the theory of automorphism-rings of abelian groups and their analogs in non-commutative groups\n)\n. The oral examination was held on\n29\nJuly\n1931\n, and the thesis was published in Berlin in\n1932\n.\nFollowing his Ph.D., Fitting continued his research at the Mathematical Institutes of the Universities of Göttingen and Leipzig, funded by the \"Notgemeinschaft der Deutschen Wissenschaften\"\n(\nwhich can be translated loosely as the Emergency Association for German Science\n)\n.\nEmmy Noether\nadvised Fitting to apply for this grant and she had strongly supported his application. In\n1934\nhe published a paper which\nEmmy Noether\ngreatly appreciated, namely\nÜber die direkten Produktzerlegungen einer Gruppe in direkt unzerlegbare Faktoren\nⓉ\n(\nOn the direct product decompositions of a group into directly indecomposable factors\n)\n.\nIn April\n1934\nFitting moved to Königsberg, where he worked as a research assistant and later as an assistant lecturer in mathematics. The position in Königsberg had arisen since, after the Nazis came to power in\n1933\n, Jewish academics were forced out of their positions and\nRichard Brauer\nhad been forced to leave Königsberg. Also\nKurt Reidemeister\n, who had held a chair at Königsberg from\n1927\n, had been forced to resign in\n1933\nbecause he was considered \"politically unsound\" by the Nazis.\nGábor Szegő\n, also a professor of mathematics at Königsberg, was forced to leave during\n1934\n. In fact it was through contacting\nRichard Brauer\nthat\nEmmy Noether\nwas able to secure the position for Fitting. She wrote a letter to\nBrauer\nthanking him for his help which was sent to the United States since by that time\nBrauer\nhad left Königsberg. Fitting was not the only new mathematics appointment to Königsberg in April\n1933\nfor\nWilhelm Specht\nwas appointed at the same time. Fitting\nhabilitated\nat the Science Faculty of the University of Königsberg in April\n1936\nand on\n1\nNovember\n1937\nhe was promoted to lecturer for mathematics. His habilitation thesis was published in two parts;\nDie Determmantenideale eines Moduls\nⓉ\n(\nThe Determinant ideal of a module\n)\n(1936)\nand\nDer Normenbegriff für die Ideale eines Ringes beliebiger Struktur\nⓉ\n(\nThe standard term for the ideals of a ring of any structure\n)\n(1937)\n. In his brief spell as a lecturer, Fitting led classes on a wide range of mathematical topics and distinguished himself, in particular, by his great attention to detail.\nAs a mathematician Fitting followed a reflective, yet meticulous approach, which allowed him to fully explore his ideas and their consequences. As a result, he was able to reach many clear and fundamental conclusions in group theory.\nAmong the many mathematical achievements of Fitting we note that he gave a proof of the\nRemak\n-\nKrull\n-\nSchmidt\ntheorem on the uniqueness of the direct product decomposition of groups into indecomposable subgroups, even for groups of operators. He devoted himself to an investigation of the ideal theory of noncommutative rings and also studied the theory of determinant ideals of finitely generated modules\nM\nM\nM\nover a commutative ring\nR\nR\nR\n. In his\n33\n-page paper\nDie Determinantenideale eines Moduls\nⓉ\n(\nThe determinant ideals of a module\n)\n(1936)\n, the first part of his habilitation thesis, Fitting introduced what today are called 'Fitting ideals' of\nM\nM\nM\n. Also in this paper is the well-known 'Fitting's Lemma' which states that if\nA\nA\nA\nand\nB\nB\nB\nare two normal nilpotent subgroups of a group\nG\nG\nG\nwith classes\na\na\na\nand\nb\nb\nb\nrespectively, then\nA\nB\nAB\nA\nB\nis a nilpotent subgroup of class at most\na\n+\nb\na+b\na\n+\nb\n.\nToday, as well as for Fitting's Lemma, he is remembered for the 'Fitting subgroup' which is used in the structure theory of finite groups: every finite group\nG\nG\nG\npossesses a unique largest normal nilpotent subgroup, the Fitting subgroup\nF\n(\nG\n)\nF(G)\nF\n(\nG\n)\n. Since the factor group\nG\n/\nF\n(\nG\n)\nG/F(G)\nG\n/\nF\n(\nG\n)\nis non-trivial for finite groups\nG\nG\nG\nthat are not nilpotent, this gives rise to the Fitting length of a finite group.\nFor a list of all Fitting's publications, see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nOn\n6\nJune\n1938\n, after a long illness, Fitting succumbed to bone cancer, aged only\n31\n.",
