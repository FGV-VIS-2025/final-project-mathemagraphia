  "biografia": "The viscount\nRobert d'Adhémar\n, born on the first of November\n1874\nin Saint Hippolyte-du-Fort\n(\nGard, France\n)\n, was descended from one of the oldest noble and protestant families from the region of Provence\n(\nSouth of France\n)\n. His father, Marius d'Adhémar, worked for the French administration as a collector of taxes\n(\nreceveur de l'enregistrement et des domaines\n)\nand, a few years before his son's birth, fought in the Franco-Prussian War of\n1870\n-\n1871\n. Robert d'Adhémar's mother was Louise Willelmine Grand d'Esnon. Although Robert was born into a protestant family and brought up as a protestant, he later converted to become a Roman Catholic.\nRobert d'Adhémar was awarded his baccalaureate in\n1890\nin Montpellier\n(\nHérault, France\n)\n. He then studied at the Lycée Ampère at Lyon, which he entered on\n1\nOctober\n1891\n, preparing for the entrance examination for the École Centrale des Arts et Manufactures de Paris. He began his studies at the École Centrale des Arts et Manufactures in\n1893\n, graduating with an engineering degree in\n1896\n. He went on to study mathematics on his own and was, therefore, self-taught in mathematics. In April\n1898\nhe wrote to his friend\nRobert de Montessus de Ballore\ntelling him about the lectures of\nÉmile Picard\nthat he was attending\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nA word in haste to tell you that I will write at length soon to tell you about the course of M\nPicard\nthat I am attending regularly - tomorrow is the\n10\nth\nlesson. We might make a judgement under these conditions, which was hard after\n3\nor\n4\nlessons. The course is wonderful, like his books only easier. In short, one learns properly only with really good books. This is to reassure and encourage you.\nFrom\n1898\nhe began teaching at the Saint François boarding school in Evreux, about\n90\nkm to the west of Paris, in fact the letter we just quoted from was sent from Evreux. He obtained his Licence es Sciences in\n1899\nfrom the Sorbonne. In\n1902\n, the lectures of\nÉmile Picard\nedited by Robert d'Adhémar were published under the title\nLeçons sur les séries à termes positifs, professées au Collège de France\nⓉ\n(\nLectures on the series with positive terms, given at the College de France\n)\n. He was elected to the\nSociété Mathématique de France\non the\n21\nFebruary\n1900\n. His candidature was supported by\nÉmile Picard\nand\nMaurice d'Ocagne\n.\nRobert d'Adhémar defended his thesis on\n22\nApril\n1904\nbefore a committee consisting of his supervisor\nÉmile Picard\n,\nJacques Hadamard\nand\nÉdouard Goursat\n. The first part of the thesis, entitled\nSur une classe d'équations aux dérivées partielles du second ordre, du type hyperbolique, à\n3\nou\n4\nvariables indépendantes\nⓉ\n(\nOn a class of hyperbolic partial differential equations of the second order with\n3\nor\n4\nindependent variables\n)\n, dealt with the partial differential equation\n(1)\nwith limit condition that arise in the two problems: the interior problem and the exterior problem.\nIn fact, he improved on a work of\nVito Volterra\non that subject. In the case of the interior problem, Robert d'Adhémar used his new methods to confirm more quickly the formulas which\nVolterra\nhad obtained. For this problem, he dealt also with the equation\n(2)\n.\nThe thesis was published in\n1905\nin the\nJournal de Mathématiques Pures et Appliquées\n(5)\n10\n, pp\n131\n-\n207\n. In a lecture to the International Congress of Mathematicians at Heidelberg in August\n1904\n,\nHadamard\nreferred to the ideas in Robert d'Adhémar's thesis.\nIn\n1901\n, Robert d'Adhémar became Maître de Conférences\n(\nessentially equivalent to an assistant lecturer\n)\nat the Lille Catholic University. He was promoted in November\n1904\nto substitute professor, then to full professor in\n1907\n. He taught differential and integral calculus. In\n1902\nhe helped his friend, the mathematician\nRobert de Montessus de Ballore\n, to join the Catholic University of Lille when he proposed him to fill a vacancy as substitute for the Special Mathematics course.\nRobert de Montessus\nwas, at this time, teaching in Senlis and d'Adhémar wrote to his friend\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nI do not write to you to influence you but I think you must have the courage to leave Senlis, as I had the audacity to leave Evreux. ...\nMoreover, in the same letter, Robert d'Adhémar explained to his friend that the course of\nJules Drach\nat the University of Lille would be of a great interest for him to prepare for the\nagrégation\n.\nRobert d'Adhémar married Jeanne Marie Henriette Duhamel\n(\nborn the\n15\nApril\n1881\nand died the\n20\nAugust\n1965)\non\n5\nFebruary\n1904\nin Merville. Jeanne Marie Henriette Duhamel was the daughter of a manufacturer who owned a castle in Merville in the north of France. Robert d'Adhémar and his wife lived in Lambersart in the suburbs of Lille.\nRobert d'Adhémar became an officer in the general staff of the French Army in Italy during World War I. He wrote to\nRobert de Montessus\nfrom the Italian front on\n25\nMay\n1918\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nMy dear friend, I spent one month in Alsace, and I was called urgently to Italy. My training in Alsace was too short ... It was also lovely. I visited all the batteries in an area, and heard the shells whistle, accompanied by a charming man, Gal Jaquet. Here we organize a large ... firing between France and Italy. I deal with the artillery and I have a lot of work under a blazing sun, surrounded by roses. The front has nothing in common with the French front.\nHe left the Lille Catholic University, being given leave during the academic years\n1920\n-\n1921\nand\n1921\n-\n1922\n, then was appointed as professor at the engineering school Institut Industriel du Nord\n(\nnow a day École Centrale de Lille\n)\nin\n1922\n.\nIt was in\n1901\nthat Robert d'Adhémar's first publications were published, namely the mathematical papers\nSur une intégration par approximations successives\nⓉ\n(\nOn integration by successive approximations\n)\nand\nSur une classe d'équations aux dérivés partielles du second ordre\nⓉ\n(\nOn a class of partial differential equations of the second order\n)\n. In the same year his\n40\n-page paper on the history of mathematics\nL'oeuvre mathématique du XIXe siècle\nⓉ\n(\nThe mathematical work of the nineteenth century\n)\nalso appeared. His first book, however, was on the philosophy of science and religion, topics which occupied him in the early part of his career. The Preface to the book\nLa philosophie des sciences et le problème religieux\nⓉ\n(\nPhilosophy of science and the religious problem\n)\n(1904)\nbegins as follows:-\nThe philosophy of science has completely changed its point of view in France in the last ten years of the\n19\nth\ncentury. I would like to show the major importance in this movement of ideas and to perceive what may be their distant consequences.\nHe divides science into three parts, mathematics, physics/chemistry, and biological sciences but, in this book, considers mainly the philosophy of mathematics and physics. The final chapter is on science and religion. He continues this discussion of the ideas in this book in his second book\nLe triple conflit : science, philosophie, religion\n(1905)\n.\nHis next book\nLes variations des théories de la science\nⓉ\n(\nChanges in theories of science\n)\n(1907)\ncontinued to investigate similar subjects. He writes in the Introduction:-\nI do not wish to speak ill of my contemporaries. And yet we must admit that when it comes to religious things, most of them lose their composure. But, addressing them, we say that the Catholic Church is the greatest in the history of religion and the Catholic faith lives in a very large number of intellectually elite men of high morals. ... we will be booed three times, held to be of unsound mind and narrow heart.\nHe goes on to say that religious thought varies both with the times and with the individual thinkers.\nAlthough he had been writing philosophy book, he continued to publish mathematical papers such as\nSur une équation aux dérivées partielles du type hyperbolique\nⓉ\n(\nOn a partial differential equation of hyperbolic type\n)\n(1905)\nand historical works such as\nTrois maîtres: Ampère, Cauchy, Hermite\nⓉ\n(\nThree masters: Ampere, Cauchy, Hermite\n)\n(1905)\n. His first mathematics book\nLes équations aux dérivées partielles à caractéristiques réelles\nⓉ\n(\nPartial differential equations with real characteristics\n)\nwas published in\n1907\n. This was quickly followed by the books\nExercices et leçons d'analyse. Quadratures. Équations différentielles. Équations intégrales de M Fredholm et de M Volterra. Équations aux dérivées partielles du second ordre\nⓉ\n(\nExercises and lessons of analysis. Quadratures. differential equations. Fredholm and Volterra integral equations. Partial differential equations of the second order\n)\n(1908)\nand\nL'équation de Fredholm et les problèmes de Dirichlet et de Neumann\nⓉ\n(\nThe Fredholm equation and problems of Dirichlet and Neumann\n)\n(1909)\n.\nIn collaboration with\nRobert de Montessus\n, he wrote the two volume book\nCalcul numérique\nⓉ\n(\nNumerical calculation\n)\n(1911)\n. The first volume covered arithmetic and algebraic operations and the second volume studied integration. This book gave numerical methods for solving non-linear equations. Perhaps his most famous book was the two volume\nLecons sur les principes de l'analyse par R d'Adhémar, professeur a la Faculté Libre des Sciences de Lille\nⓉ\n(\nLessons on the principles of analysis of R Adhemar, professor at the Free Faculty of Sciences at Lille\n)\n. The first volume\nSéries.- Déterminants.- Intégrales.- Potentiels. Equations intégrales. Equations différentielles et fonctionnnelles\nⓉ\n(\nSeries.- Determinants.- Integrals.- potentials. Integral Equations. functional and differential equations\n)\nwas published in\n1912\nwith the second volume\nFonctions synectiques, méthodes des majorantes. Equations aux derivées partielles du premier ordre. Fonctions entières\nⓉ\n(\nSynectic functions, the method of majorant. Partial differential equations of the first order. Entire functions\n)\nbeing published in the following year.\nHis later books were:\nHenri Poincaré\n(1914)\n;\nRésistance des matériaux\nⓉ\n(\nResistance of materials\n)\n(1921)\n; and\nStatique cinématique\nⓉ\n(\nStatic kinematics\n)\n(1923)\nwhich was intended as an introduction to mechanics for engineers. He wrote several works on ballistics such as\nLa balistique extérieure\nⓉ\n(\nExterior ballistics\n)\n, Gauthier-Villars\n(\nParis,\n1934)\nand\nThéorie du mouvement gyroscopique des projectiles\nⓉ\n(\nTheory of the gyroscopic movement  of projectiles\n)\n(1939)\n.",
