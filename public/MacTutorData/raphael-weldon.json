  "biografia": "Raphael Weldon\n's mother was Anne Cotton and his father was Walter Weldon. Walter was a journalist and chemist, and he moved around the country so frequently that it was not possible for Raphael to attend school until he reached thirteen years of age. Walter and Anne had three children; their first child was a girl, with Raphael born next followed by his younger brother Dante.\nRaphael did receive some tutoring from a local clergyman before he was thirteen years old then, in\n1873\n, he entered Mr Watson's boarding school at Caversham near Reading. After three years at the school, followed by several months of private study, he entered University College, London, in\n1876\n. There he studied a wide range of subjects which he took in preparation for studying medicine. He was taught mathematics by\nHenrici\nwho impressed Weldon more than any of his other lecturers; he later wrote that\nHenrici\nwas the first naturally gifted teacher he had studied under.\nIn\n1877\nWeldon went to King's College, London, his aim still being to enter the medical profession. He moved to St John's College in Cambridge, matriculating on\n6\nApril\n1878\n, and, influenced by Francis Maitland Balfour, his interests turned towards zoology. He won scholarships and produced outstanding results despite periods of ill health. Before he sat the Natural Science Tripos in\n1881\nhe suffered a tragedy when his brother Dante died suddenly. Despite the exceptionally difficult circumstances under which he took the examinations, he gained a First Class degree that year.\nAfter graduating he began research, going to Naples where he worked at the Zoological Station. He was appointed a demonstrator in zoology at Cambridge in\n1882\n, becoming a fellow of St John's College and a university lecturer in invertebrate morphology in\n1884\n. His teaching was described in these glowing terms:-\nSeldom is it given to a man to teach as Weldon taught. He lectured almost as one inspired. His extreme earnestness was only equalled by his lucidity. He awoke enthusiasm even in the dullest, and had the divine gift of compelling interest.\nWeldon married Florence Tebb, from Burstow in Surrey, on\n13\nMarch\n1883\n. She played a large role in Weldon's scientific work, assisting him on many of his projects. After he was married Weldon took all his holidays with his wife in places where they could study marine biology. In particular they visited the Bahamas in\n1886\nfor a visit which was scientifically very profitable. The Marine Biological Association set up a laboratory in Plymouth and Weldon and his wife began spending all their vacations there undertaking research. By\n1888\nthey were spending as much time there as Weldon's duties at Cambridge would allow, and he only went to the university to give his lectures. He undertook research June to January, teaching at Cambridge for two terms each year.\nWhy is this zoologist in our History of Mathematics Archive? His work soon began to involve statistical analysis. He was led in this direction by work of\nGalton\non natural inheritance. He extended the statistical analysis that\nGalton\nand\nQuetelet\nhad applied to humans to other zoological species. Realising that his mathematical skills were somewhat less than he wished, Weldon read widely studying, in particular, the leading works by the French mathematicians on the calculus of\nprobability\n. His work involved studying correlation coefficients for the relation between measurements of organs in animals and is important for the beginnings of biometry.\nHe studied shrimps making measurements of different features on shrimps from different locations. He soon found that the measurements he took lay on a normal distribution. He published two papers on this topic, the second investigating correlations between measurements of certain organs in the shrimps. Many consider that these two papers lay the foundations of \"biometrics\".\nWeldon was elected a fellow of the\nRoyal Society\nin May\n1890\nand later that year he was appointed Jodrell professor at University College, London, taking up his duties in\n1891\n. This was a fortunate appointment, for it brought him in close contact with\nPearson\nwho had been appointed there five years earlier. Walker writes\n(\nsee\nPearson\n's biography\n)\n:-\nThe importance for science of the intense personal friendship which soon sprang up between\nPearson\nand Weldon, then both in their early thirties, can scarcely be exaggerated. Weldon asked the questions that drove\nPearson\nto some of his most significant contributions.\nWhat were the questions which Weldon asked\nPearson\n? How does one describe asymmetrical, double-humped, and other non-Gaussian frequency distributions? How does one derive best values for the parameters of such distributions? What are the probable errors of such estimates? What is the effect of selection on one or more of the correlated variables?\nBy\n1893\nWeldon was serving on a\nRoyal Society\nCommittee along with\nGalton\nand\nPearson\n'For the Purpose of conducting Statistical Enquiry into the Variability of Organisms'. In a paper which he published in\n1894\nSome remarks on variation in plants and animals\nwhich arose from the work of the Royal Society Committee, Weldon wrote:-\n... the questions raised by the Darwinian hypothesis are purely statistical, and the statistical method is the only one at present obvious by which that hypothesis can be experimentally checked.\nWeldon proposed a journal for biometrics in a letter written to\nPearson\ndated\n16\nNovember\n1899\n. It was written after William Bateson, a pioneer in genetics, had been highly critical of one of Pearson's papers submitted to the\nRoyal Society\n. Weldon wrote:-\nThe contention 'that numbers mean nothing and do not exist in Nature' is a very serious thing, which will have to be fought. Most other people have got beyond it, but most biologists have not. Do you think it would be too hopelessly expensive to start a journal of some kind? ...\nThe journal\nBiometrika\nwas named within weeks and Weldon and\nPearson\nbecame joint editors. They were remarkably quick in getting the journal up and running, for the first issue appeared in October\n1901\n. The editorial, written by Weldon and Pearson, set out the scope:-\nBiometrika will include\n(\na\n)\nmemoirs on variation, inheritance, and selection in animals and plants, based upon the examination of statistically large numbers of specimens\n(\nthis will of course include statistical investigations of anthropometry\n)\n;\n(\nb\n)\nthose developments of statistical theory which are applicable to biological problems;\n(\nc\n)\nnumerical tables and graphical solutions tending to reduce the labour of statistical arithmetic;\n(\nd\n)\nabstracts of memoirs, dealing with these subjects, which are published elsewhere; and\n(\ne\n)\nnotes on current biometric work and unsolved problems.\nWeldon was appointed to a chair in Oxford in\n1900\nand he held this post until his death in\n1906\n. In\n1898\nhe had given the presidential address to Section D, the zoology section, of the\nBritish Association\n, and during the\n1904\nmeeting in Cambridge he became involved in an argument over Mendel's work on plant hybridisation\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nMr William Bateson, as president of Section D for that year, had devoted his address to a vindication of Mendelian principles in regard to heredity and variation, and subsequent discussion on the same subject provoked from professor Weldon and Professor\nKarl Pearson\nsome rather severe criticism, to which Mr Bateson replied. The debate, which was conducted before a large and somewhat agitated audience, resolved itself into a dialectical duel between the president of the section and professor Weldon, and developed quite a considerable amount of heat.\nIn the Easter vacation of\n1906\nWeldon was staying with his wife in an inn at Woolstone when he contracted pneumonia. It is likely that the illness became serious due to overwork and Weldon's refusal to stop work when he became ill. Refusing to give up work, he returned to London by which time the pneumonia had become acute. He was admitted to a nursing home but died there. He was buried at Holywell in Oxford.\nIn\n[\n2\n]\nPearson\ngives this rather touching description of Weldon:-\nHe was by nature a poet, and these give the best to science, for they give ideas.",
