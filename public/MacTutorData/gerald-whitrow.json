  "summary": "Gerald Whitrow undertook research on relativity and wrote a number of books, especially on 'time'. He believed that the history of science was important in works describing technical mathematics. He put this into practice in both his papers and his books.",
  "biografia": "Gerald Whitrow\nwas the son of George William Whitrow\n(1875\n-\n1953)\nand Emily Watkins\n(1877\n-\n1956)\n. George Whitrow, born in Kimmeridge on\n28\nJuly\n1875\nto the shale miner Henry Whitrow and his wife Maria Foot, became a farmer and, at the time Gerald was born, was farming near Kimmeridge. Emily Watkins was born on\n22\nJuly\n1877\n. Gerald was the elder of his parents' two sons.\nAround\n1916\nthe family moved to Clapham, London when George Whitrow began working in Harrods. Soon after the move, Gerald began his schooling at Wix's Lane School. Wix's Lane marked the boundary between Battersea and Clapham and, on\n27\nApril\n1903\n, the London School Board had opened a school on the Battersea side of the lane. Gerald\n[\n18\n]\n:-\n... was a very clever child, and at the age of six preferred reading books to playing games.\nWhile still studying at the primary school in Wix's Lane, he continued with a very mature attitude to learning\n[\n17\n]\n:-\nHis abilities were in evidence at a precocious age since by the age of nine he was delivering lectures to his family on Sunday evenings.\nHe won a London County Council scholarship to the famous independent school, Christ's Hospital, situated south of Horsham in West Sussex and entered the school as a boarder on\n19\nSeptember\n1923\n. Theodore William Chaundy\n(1889\n-\n1966)\n, who held a lectureship at Christ Church, Oxford, examined the pupils of Christ's Hospital in mathematics. Whitrow impressed Chaundy so much that he arranged for Whitrow to receive a scholarship to study at Christ Church, Oxford. Whitrow graduated from Christ's Hospital on\n29\nJuly\n1930\nand, in October of that year, began his university studies of mathematics at Christ Church.\nChaundy became Whitrow's tutor at Christ Church and advised him throughout his undergraduate career.\nW L Ferrar\nwrote \"As a tutor\n[\nChaudry\n]\nwas a great inspiration to the good mathematician,\" and certainly Whitrow was outstanding so was inspired by Chaundy. Although Whitrow studied a broad range of mathematical topics, his love was directed more towards the pure side rather than in applications. This, however, changed in January\n1933\nwhen Chaudry advised him to attend\nE A Milne\n's lectures on relativity. He was immediately fascinated by\nMilne\n's lectures and, after graduating with a B.Sc. in\n1933\nhe was awarded a Senior University Studentship to undertake research for a D.Phil. advised by\nMilne\n.\nWhitrow began publishing papers even before graduating with his first degree. His first paper was\nThe Importance of the History of Mathematics in Relation to the Study of Mathematical Technique\nwhich appeared in\nThe Mathematical Gazette\nin October\n1932\n. It is interesting to note that the ideas he put forward in this paper were ones which became fundamental in his lifelong mathematical output. The paper begins:-\nGlaisher\n, I believe, once said that no subject loses more than mathematics by any attempt to dissociate it from its history. It is still customary, however, in schools and most universities to regard the history of mathematics as an \"extra\" outside the ordinary student's syllabus - indeed it is usually treated as an exotic luxury. The point I would like to emphasise is that while the primary aim of the tyro should be the mastery of technique, yet in most cases this mastery is liable to become a mere mechanical acquirement unless it is accompanied by some appreciation of the cultural significance of the \"Queen of the Sciences\". A number of excellent treatises, theses and textbooks have been written on mathematical history. With very few exceptions these are absolutely distinct from the technical treatises, theses and textbooks. Today we really require a series of books carefully planned to bridge the gap between these two classes - books not designed to usurp the functions of any particular books now in use but to supplement them.\nWhitrow set about trying to 'bridge the gap' with his second paper,\nContinuity and Irrational Number\n, which appeared in\nThe Mathematical Gazette\nin July\n1933\n. It begins:-\nIn a previous article I have outlined my conception of the role of history in the exposition of mathematical technique. In this article I attempt to provide my bare thesis with a respectable clothing of practicability. The treatment of Number and Continuity which follows is a short and very sketchy historical supplement to the technical treatment of the same subjects in, say, the earlier chapters of\nHardy\n's 'Pure Mathematics'.\nAlthough Whitrow only began attending\nMilne\n's lectures on relativity in January\n1933\n, already by\n19\nMarch of that year he had submitted the paper\nA derivation of the Lorentz formulae\nto\nThe Quarterly Journal of Mathematics\n. It begins:-\nIn a recent paper Narliker has given a new derivation of the\nLorentz\nformulae of special relativity. It may therefore not be inopportune to communicate the present note which gives a derivation of the\nLorentz\nformulae from a different starting-point. The considerations underlying the derivation are of a more physical character.\nThe method used by Whitrow in this paper had been suggested by\nMilne\nand, based on ideas in lectures given by\nMilne\nbeginning in October\n1933\n, Whitrow wrote\nOn equivalent observers\nwhich he submitted to\nThe Quarterly Journal of Mathematics\non\n21\nJanuary\n1935\n. Later in\n1935\nWhitrow was elected to a Harmsworth Senior Scholarship in mathematics at Merton College. He held this scholarship for two years but, in\n1936\n, he was appointed as a mathematics lecturer at Christ Church. His application for the position had been strongly supported by\nMilne\nwho described him in his reference as \"one of the most original natural philosophers of our time.\" He published a number of single author papers and three joint publications with\nMilne\nin\n1938\n, namely:\nOn the meaning of uniform time, and the kinematic equivalence of the extra-galactic nebulae\n;\nOn a linear equivalence discussed by L Page\n; and\nPhysical Sciences: Reversibility of the Equations of Classical Dynamics\n.\nWhitrow was awarded his D.Phil. in\n1939\nfor a thesis on kinematic relativity. This thesis contained work already published in two\n1936\npapers:\nKinematical Relativity\n(\nI\n)\n: Relatively Stationary Observers\n; and\nKinematical Relativity\n(\nII\n)\n: Equivalent Observers in Uniform Relative Motion in Skew Trajectories\n.\nThe outbreak of World War II in September\n1939\nchanged the course of Whitrow's career which, almost certainly, would otherwise have remained at the University of Oxford. In\n1940\nhe left his position as a lecturer at Christ Church and worked as a Scientific Officer for the Ministry of Supply\n[\n17\n]\n:-\nHis work was on defence research, including ballistics, and he worked at Fort Halstead\n(\nnear Sevenoaks\n)\nand Cambridge. While in his Portugal Street digs in Cambridge, he had a lucky escape when they were destroyed during the only bombing raid on the city.\nWhen the war ended in\n1945\n, Whitrow returned to his university career but not back at Oxford, rather he was appointed as an assistant lecturer at Imperial College, London. After one year in this post he was promoted to lecturer. On\n17\nAugust\n1946\nhe married Annie Magda Mostel. Magda had been born in Vienna on\n6\nJune\n1914\nto the clerk Rudolf Mostel\n(1881\n-\n1954)\nand his wife Irma TÃ¼rki\n(1889\n-\n1955)\n. She was a refugee who had been exempted from internment on\n19\nOctober\n1939\n. At that time she was working as a librarian for Woodall Duckham Construction Ltd., an engineering company covering a large range of engineering projects from chemical to oil, energy and construction situated at Uplands, Epsom Road, Gilford. The exemption certificate gives her address at that time as Flat\n3\n, Waterden Road, Gilford and her normal occupation as foreign correspondent. Whitrow\n[\n17\n]\n:-\n... and Magda lived first in Battersea and from\n1967\nin Wimbledon. The marriage was remarkably happy and their house a hospitable location for students, friends and colleagues to meet, talk and eat.\nLet us note that Magda Whitrow became an outstanding bibliographer and historian of science. She published books and articles such as:\nIsis Cumulative Bibliography\n(\nVols\n1\n,\n2\n1971\n; Vol\n3\n1976)\n;\nA classification scheme for the history of science, medicine, and technology\n(1978)\n;\nCondorcet: A pioneer in information retrieval?\n(1982)\n;\nWagner-Jauregg and fever therapy\n(1990)\n;\nBibliographical developments in the history of science\n(1992)\n;\nJulius Wagner-Jauregg\n(1857\n-\n1940)\n(1993)\n; and\nTheodor Meynert\n(1833\n-\n1892)\n: His life and poetry\n(1996)\n.\nGerald Whitrow remained at Imperial College for the rest of his career. He was a prolific author with over\n100\npapers and several books published during these years. The first of these books was\nThe Structure of the Universe\n(1949)\n.\nWilliam McCrea\nwrites in the review\n[\n20\n]\n:-\nHistorians and philosophers of science may perhaps look to Dr Whitrow's book to provide an account of the present state of the purely scientific side of his subject, rather than to contribute to their own special fields. It may be said at once that he has given a brilliant description of the astronomical evidence concerning the structure, behaviour and ages of the galaxies and concerning the structure of the whole system of galaxies that constitutes the observable universe. He has given also an extraordinarily able\n(\nnon-mathematical\n)\ndescription of current general cosmological theory, with special prominence for the ideas of\nEddington\nand\nMilne\n, together with some account of more detailed matters such as galactic kinematics and dynamics.\nDr Whitrow is, however, particularly well qualified to write also upon both the historical and philosophical aspects of his subject: readers specially interested in these aspects will be glad to find that his presentation keeps them so well in view. In fact, even the professional historian of science will get a fresh perspective in his own domain from the material brought together by the author in his first three chapters, which give a historical account of the exploration of the universe and of ideas of space and time.\nFor further extracts from reviews of this and other books written by Whitrow, see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nThese other books include:\n(\nwith G O Jones and J Rotblat\n)\nAtoms and the Universe\n(1956)\n;\nThe Structure and Evolution of the Universe\n(1959)\n;\nThe Structure and Evolution of the Universe - An Introduction to Cosmology\n(1959)\n,\nThe Natural Philosophy of Time\n(1961)\n;\nThe Nature of Time\n(1973)\n; and\nTime in History: The Evolution of Our General Awareness of Time and Temporal Perspective\n(1988)\n. Whitrow also edited, and contributed to,\nEinstein: The man and his achievement\n(1967)\n. Heilbron, however, is critical of attempts to explain highly technical ideas to a general reader, writing in the review\n[\n13\n]\nthat the aim of the book was:-\n... the conveyance of some notion of\nEinstein\n's scientific achievements to a large and heterogeneous audience. This little book is not notably successful as an attempt to popularise science. Despite the evident efforts of Drs Whitrow, Sciama and Bonnor, who prepared the summary statements, their necessarily extremely abbreviated accounts can carry no very clear idea of\nEinstein\n's work to those unacquainted with relativity and quantum theory. The popularisation of modern physics presents very severe difficulties, and it would appear both ungrateful and unfair to fault those who respond to the challenge for failing to resolve them all. Yet one may well ask whether attempts like these broadcasts do not achieve precisely the opposite of the objective they seek. Over-compression in explaining relativity and quantum physics to the non-physicist may tend more to enhance than to dispel their mystery.\nLet us return to a description of Whitrow's career. He was promoted from Lecturer to Reader in Applied Mathematics at Imperial College, London, in\n1951\n. In\n1972\nhe became a professor when given the personal chair of History and Applications of Mathematics.\nWe have mentioned Whitrow's research contributions, but he contributed in many other ways\n[\n17\n]\n:-\nBut it was not only in research and writing that Whitrow brought credit to the college. He was an excellent lecturer, with his clear intonation matched by clarity of exposition. Furthermore, he took part in the running of the college and university, serving on a number of committees. Between\n1972\nand\n1974\nhe was College Orator, where his knowledge of Latin was put to good use.\nWhitrow made major contributions to the\nRoyal Astronomical Society\n. He was elected a Fellow on\n14\nJune\n1940\n, served two terms on the Society's Council and was Vice-President of the Society in\n1965\n-\n67\n. He played a large role in the reorganisation of the Society's library and was Chairman of the Society's Library Committee from the early\n1960\ns to\n1975\n. Following his death, the\nRoyal Astronomical Society\nfounded the Gerald Whitrow Lecture and it was first awarded in\n2001\n. The lecture:-\n... is given every two years by a distinguished and eloquent speaker on any topic in cosmology, including its philosophy. The speaker may be based in the UK or overseas. The lecture is delivered at an Ordinary\n(\nA&G\n)\nMeeting of the\nRoyal Astronomical Society\n.\nHe was a staunch supporter of the\nRoyal Astronomical Society\n's Dining Club\n[\n17\n]\n:-\nHe was elected a member of the\nRoyal Astronomical Society\nmonthly Dining Club on\n13\nJanuary\n1950\nand two years later became its Treasurer\n(\nthat is, its Executive Officer\n)\n, a post he held until\n1970\n, a record equalled only by George Dollond\n(1774\n-\n1852)\n. In this capacity Whitrow edited the third volume of the Records of the Club. Serving as President between\n1978\nand\n1986\n, in total he attended\n347\ndinners, failing by just three to equal the record set by\nJames Glaisher\n(1848\n-\n1928)\n. At the Club's dinner held during the IAU last year in Manchester, those present drank a silent toast to his memory.\nThe history of science played a large role in Whitrow's life starting in his undergraduate days. He attended the 'International Congress of the History of Science' in London in\n1931\nwhile still in the first year of his undergraduate studies. He was an early member of the British Society for the History of Science which was founded in\n1947\n, served several terms on its Council, and was elected President for\n1968\n-\n70\n. He was also an enthusiastic member of the British Society for the Philosophy of Science having been involved in its establishment\n[\n34\n]\n:-\nIn\n1948\na group of historians, philosophers and scientists met at the University College London to discuss the formation of a Philosophy of Science Group. A Provisional Committee consisting ofÂ AlistairÂ Crombie,\nHerbert Dingle\n, Karl Popper, F I G Rawlins, and  Gerald Whitrow met to formulate the statement of aims, writing, \"The purpose of the Group is to study the logic and method of science as well as of the various special sciences, including the social sciences. The main emphasis is upon an approach through the various special sciences to the philosophy of science.\" The Group was originally approved as a group affiliated withÂ British Society for the History of Science, and the first annual meeting was held on\n15\nNovember\n1948\nat University College London.Â In January of\n1959\nthe Philosophy of Science Group was reconstituted as the British Society for the Philosophy of Science ...\nWhitrow was also a major figure in the founding of the British Society for the History of Mathematics. The formation of a society for the history of mathematics was discussed by John Dubbey and Arthur Morley when they met in the buffet at St Pancras Station, London and decided to convene an open meeting. They\n[\n37\n]\n:-\n... approached Gerald Whitrow, who gave his enthusiastic support and agreed to chair this exploratory meeting. This took place at Thames Polytechnic\n[\nnow the University of Greenwich\n]\non\n2\nJuly\n1971\nwith, to the surprise and delight of the organisers, over fifty participants.\nWhitrow served as the first President of the British Society for the History of Mathematics in\n1971\n-\n74\n.\nIt is worth noting that, as an historian, Whitrow was interested in the background to the research problems he was studying. In this he showed great expertise but, in some ways, it was a restricted view of the history of mathematics as this review by\nDirk Struik\nof one of Whitrow's last papers,\nWhy did mathematics begin to take off in the sixteenth century?\n(1988)\n, shows.\nStruik\n, a renowned historian of mathematics, writes:-\nThe question in the title of this paper is, according to the author, \"one of the great puzzles in the history of mathematics.\" He points to the novel art of printing, used by\nRegiomontanus\nand\nPacioli\n(\nwho was influenced by\nLeonardo Fibonacci\n)\n, to the impact made by\nCardan\n's \"Ars magna\" and the work of\nViÃ¨te\n, setting algebra \"on the path by which it eventually supplanted geometry.\" Since the author hardly mentions the many demands of the traders, bankers, surveyors, engineers and navigators in the flourishing mercantile towns, it is no wonder that he concludes that \"why sixteenth century mathematics should have this remarkable outcome instead of petering out is far from clear.\"\nOn\n21\nOctober\n1987\n, to commemorate the tercentenary of the publication of\nNewton\n's\nPrincipia\n, Whitrow delivered the public lecture\nNewton's role in the history of mathematics\nin the Mathematics Department of Imperial College London. His lecture was published by the Royal Society of London as a\n22\n-page paper. Here is Whitrow's conclusions:-\nNewton\nhas often been ranked with\nArchimedes\nand\nGauss\nas one of the three greatest mathematicians of all time. Like them he was equally outstanding in both pure and applied mathematics. Also like them he had an insatiable love of making lengthy numerical computations. For example, in the intoxication of youth he calculated several logarithms to\n55\nplaces! He and\nGauss\nalso resembled each other in their reluctance to publish. There was no public cry of 'Eureka!' from either of them.\nNewton\n's role in the history of mathematics was to be the outstanding successor to\nDescartes\n. The expression of a curve by its algebraic equation, an idea which we owe to the great Frenchman, led\nNewton\nto the wider concept of the explicit function of a single variable, as the result of a technique which disentangled the two coordinates from their implicit equation and exhibited the one as a function of the other in a finite or infinite series. The generality and efficiency of this mathematical process is essentially due to\nNewton\n. The first of the fundamental discoveries by which he transformed mathematics was that of expansion into infinite series and his recognition of the validity of this way of expressing a function, first revealed to him as early as\n1664\nin his binomial theorem. He fully understood the need for a proof of convergence, even if he did not quite attain modern standards of rigour.\nHis next major advance was to recognise that quadrature\n(\nor integration\n)\nand tangency\n(\ngeneralised as differentiation\n)\nare inverse operations. The ingenious ad hoc geometrical methods of his predecessors were thus replaced by purely analytical techniques of wide-ranging application. But his crowning achievement was the mathematical theory of universal gravitation presented in the 'Principia'. Its publication just\n300\nyears ago, on\n5\nJuly\n1687\n, inaugurated the fundamental branch of science which we now call mathematical physics.\nAfter Whitrow died in June\n2000\n, there was a private funeral after which his ashes were scattered on the Christ Church Meadow. Frank James writes\n[\n17\n]\n:-\nA moving memorial service was held at Holy Trinity Church, Prince Consort Road, where colleagues and former students paid tribute to his memory. Whitrow was a man of complete integrity, who was always totally dedicated to whatever he had in hand and courteous to a fault. His memory was prodigious and he could, until his last few weeks, recollect events of\n60\nyears before\n(\nsuch as the\n1931\nCongress\n)\nwith astonishing clarity. He will be sadly missed by friends and colleagues from many academic disciplines.\nWhitrow's wife Magda died in London on\n1\nFebruary\n2011\n. In\n2013\nthe Commission on Bibliography and Documentation of the International Union of History and Philosophy of Science and Technology/Division of History of Science and Technology founded the Neu-Whitrow Bibliography Prize to beÂ awarded every four years to an individual or team for creating the most innovative research tool for managing, documenting and analysing sources within the history of science and technology. It is named after the outstanding bibliographers John Neu of the University of Wisconsin, and Magda Whitrow.",
