  "biografia": "Roberto Vázquez Garciá\nwas the son of Enrique Feliciano Vázquez Espinosa\n(1879\n-\n1941)\nand Dolores Garcia Vázquez\n(1886\n-\n)\n. Roberto had the siblings Leonila Vázquez García, Raquel Vázquez García and Eugenia Vázquez García.\nHe began his primary studies in\n1924\nat the \"Galación Gómez\" junior school in the Cuauhtémoc district of Mexico City. He continued his studies at the \"El Pensador Mexicano\" school graduating in\n1928\n. His secondary studies continued at Secondary School number\n4\nbetween\n1929\nand\n1931\n. Certainly Roberto excelled at school, showing particular talents in mathematics. What is less clear is whether he enjoyed his school days. Certainly in later life he said that he regarded his school days as a huge waste of time. He said that state education around\n1930\nin Mexico was a shameless farce of colossal dimensions and it had improved little over the years. He certainly was not being critical of his teachers for he considered many of them to be excellent but rather it was the system that he was critical of.\nHe attended the National Preparatory School in\n1932\nand studied there until\n1933\n. This school, originally a Jesuit College in the centre of Mexico City, had been taken over by the government in\n1868\nand brought pupils up to the standard required for entering the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México. At this school he was taught by\nAlfonso Nápoles Gándara\nwho had been appointed head of mathematics there in\n1926\nbut had spent the years\n1930\n-\n32\nat the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\nIn\n1934\n, Vázquez entered the National School of Engineers. Although he was keen to study mathematics, at this time the only way to do this in Mexico was to take an engineering degree. Things were beginning to change, however, at about this time and moves were being made towards introducing degrees in mathematics.\nJosé Adem\nexplains in\n[\n5\n]\nthat when\nNápoles Gándara\nreturned from studying in the United States, he taught high level mathematics courses:-\nThe lectures that\nNápoles Gándara\ngave upon his return became the main basis for training a group of young higher mathematics teachers who would later constitute the physical-mathematical faculty of our Faculty of Sciences.\nJosé Adem\nexplained how mathematics developed in Mexico providing an environment which allowed Vázquez to train as a mathematician\n[\n5\n]\n:-\nParallel to teaching, research began to be organised when in\n1932\n, and at the initiative of a group headed by\nSotera Prieto\n,\nNápoles Gándara\n, Jorge Quijano and Mariano Hernández, the Section of Mathematics and Theoretical Physics was formed at the Antonio Alzate National Academy of Sciences. The weekly sessions that were held for several years were one of the first stimuli received by mathematical research in Mexico. Several professors participated in this mathematical seminar, as well as a group of distinguished students of\nSotera Prieto\nand\nNápoles Gándara\n.\nBoth\nAlberto Barajas\nand\nCarlos Graef\nhad, like Vázquez, began their undergraduate studies in the National School of Engineers. They were a couple of years ahead of Vázquez and, in\n1934\n, they both decided to dedicate themselves professionally to mathematics. They were a major influence on the younger Vázquez both in adding to his enthusiasm for mathematics and also for increasing his knowledge of it.\nVázquez began teaching in\n1937\nat the National Preparatory School, where he taught for nine years,  and at the National School of Engineering where he taught for ten years.\nIt was through the efforts of\nNápoles Gándara\nthat, towards the end of\n1938\n, the Faculty of Sciences was created in the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México. Vázquez moved from the School of Engineers to attend courses at the Faculty of Sciences as soon as it was set up. We quote from\nCarlos Graef\nabout the mathematical environment at the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico that Vázquez entered\n[\n3\n]\n:-\n... the Department of Physics and Mathematics was located in the Palacio de Minería, home to the School of Engineers. The neighbourhood in the space of the two establishments was very fruitful. The professors in the Physics and Mathematics department were professors from the School of Engineering who had a special love for exact sciences. Those who were then dedicated to teaching these subjects had to give many hours of class every day to be able to collect a decent remuneration. There was no physics or mathematics institute, and the only income for them was from their teaching work.\nVázquez completed his studies in\n1939\n, but the Faculty of Sciences had not at that time received the right to award degrees so Vázquez graduated with the degree of Master of Science in\n1941\nwith the thesis\nConjuntos Limites\nⓉ\n(\nLimit sets\n)\n. The first courses he taught at the Faculty of Sciences were\nTheory of Functions of Real Variables\n,\nMathematical Analysis I\n, and\nMathematical Analysis II\n. A scholarship from the Rockefeller Foundation allowed him to spend two years at Princeton University. There he took courses given by\nHermann Weyl\nand began undertaking research with the aim of submitting a Ph.D. thesis to Princeton.\nSolomon Bochner\nsuggested a topic for Vázquez to study and, not surprisingly, he suggesting problems associated with the work he was thinking about at the time.\nBochner\nhad published\nHilbert distances and positive definite functions\nin\n1941\nand was working on the paper\nCompletely monotone functions in partially ordered spaces\nwhich was published in\n1942\n. Vázquez's scholarship was only for two years and was not specifically to allow him to obtain a Ph.D., so he had to return to Mexico City in\n1943\n. His intention at the time was, however, to complete work on his thesis and, in due course, to submit it to Princeton.\nShortly after Vázquez returned to Mexico City, on\n30\nJune\n1943\nthe\nMexican Mathematical Society\nwas founded there. It initially consisted of\n131\nfounding members, one of these being Vázquez. The Instituto Matemáticas of the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México was founded on\n30\nJune\n1942\nand\nNápoles Gandára\nwas appointed as its first director. Vázquez joined the Institute of Mathematics on his return in\n1943\nand rapidly became involved in its activities. The Institute of Mathematics began to operate in the Palacio de Minería, in the historic centre of Mexico City. The building also housed the National School of Engineers and the recently founded Faculty of Sciences. The Institute was subdivided into three areas: Pure Mathematics, led by\nAlberto Barajas\nand Roberto Vázquez, Applied Mathematics, led by\nCarlos Graef\n, and Logic and Fundamentals led by Francisco Zubieta. These four young researchers and the director\nAlfonso Nápoles Gándara\nwere the only members of the Institute's academic staff in the first few years of its existence.\nIn\n1944\n,\nGeorge David Birkhoff\nmade one of his regular visits to the Institute of Mathematics to encourage research activities. In addition to working to complete his thesis, Vázquez began undertaking research on problems proposed by\nG D Birkhoff\n. Collaborating with Francisco Zubieta Russi, Vázquez published jointly authored articles such as\nThe linear homogeneous continua of George D Birkhoff\n(\nSpanish\n)\nand\nNote on the continuum\n(\nSpanish\n)\nin the first volume of the\nBulletin\nof the\nMexican Mathematical Society\nin\n1944\n. He also published the single authored article\nHypersurfaces with width\n(\nSpanish\n)\nin the second volume of the\nBulletin\nof the\nMexican Mathematical Society\nin\n1945\n.\nIn addition to undertaking joint research activities with his colleague Francisco Zubieta Russi from the Institute of Mathematics, Vázquez also did joint work with Javier Barros Sierra, who worked in the National School of Engineering. Javier Barros Sierra\n(1915\n-\n1971)\nhad studied civil engineering at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México and taught for many years both at the National Preparatory School and in the National School of Engineering. Looking at another problem posed by\nG D Birkhoff\n, Vázquez and Barros published the joint paper\nTheorems on geodesic circles and the Gaussian curvature\n(\nSpanish\n)\nin the third volume of the\nBulletin\nof the\nMexican Mathematical Society\nin\n1946\n. You can see a list of papers published by Vázquez at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nVázquez also wrote, with co-author Javier Barros Sierra, the textbook\nIntroducción al cálculo diferencial e integral\nⓉ\n(\nIntroduction to differential and integral calculus\n)\nwhich was first published in\n1946\n. A second edition was published in\n1958\nand, since the book enjoyed a continued popularity, by\n1973\na fifth edition had appeared\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nIt is worth mentioning about this book that, from its first edition, it became the text par excellence not only for the corresponding subject in the National Preparatory School but also for the first courses of this subject taught in faculties such as Engineering, Chemical Sciences and Sciences.\nG D Birkhoff\ndied in November\n1944\nand\nSolomon Lefschetz\ntook over his role in encouraging research at the Institute of Mathematics in Mexico City.\nLefschetz\nwas keen that Vázquez should return to Princeton and present his completed thesis for a Princeton Ph.D. This, however, proved impossible since Vázquez did not have funds to pay the fare and accommodation costs. Partly this was because he had just got married: he had married Isabel Landázuri Prieto on\n11\nAugust\n1944\n. Isabel had been born in Mexico City on\n14\nOctober\n1920\nto civil engineer Raúl Landázuri and his wife Teresa Prieto. Roberto and Isabel had three children: Raúl Vázquez Landázuri\n(\nborn\n8\nJuly\n1945)\n; Isabel Vázquez Landázuri\n(\nborn\n30\nMay\n1947)\nand Rocío Vázquez Landázuri.\nUnable to afford going to Princeton to complete all the necessary procedures to earn his Ph.D., Vázquez decided to submit his thesis to the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México which now had the right to award doctorates. The thesis,\nFunciones Definitivamente Positivas en Espacios Parcialmente Ordenados\nⓉ\n(\nPositive definite functions in partially ordered spaces\n)\n, already had the approval of\nSolomon Bochner\n, so acceptance was straightforward. He was awarded the Ph.D. in\n1947\nbecoming the first person to be awarded a Ph.D. in mathematics from the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México. Vázquez's research had been in functional analysis and differential geometry but, influenced by\nLefschetz\n's lectures on topology, he became interested in research in that topic.\nLefschetz\nwrote in\n[\n7\n]\nabout his interactions with the mathematicians in Mexico City:-\nIn\n1944\nI joined as a part-time connection the Instituto de Mathematicas at the National University of Mexico. This continued until\n1966\n. At the Instituto I was as free as under my Princeton professorship. I conducted seminars in topology and differential equations, gave a couple of times a \"volunteer\" course on \"general mathematical concepts\" directed at beginners and, thanks to a good working library, was able to continue research.\nAlthough Vázquez began research in topology, he did not at that time have Mexican colleagues working on the topic so he worked alone and only published one paper on topology in the ten years between\n1947\nto\n1956\n. We know he was working on the topic since, in\n1951\n, he presented the paper\nThree notes on cohomology groups\nto the Mexican Scientific Congress. He spent\n1953\n-\n54\nas a visiting professor at Princeton University where he increased his knowledge of topology. The International Congress of Mathematicians was held in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, from\n2\nSeptember to\n9\nSeptember\n1954\n. The Instituto de Mathematicas in Mexico City was represented at the Congress by\nJosé Adem Chahín\n,\nAlfonso Nápoles y Gándara\n, Roberto Vázquez García and Emilio Lluis Riera. Emilio Lluis Riera\n(1925\n-\n2020)\nhad a bachelor's and master's degree from the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México and then worked for a Ph.D. at the new Ciudad Universitaria Mexico.\nVázquez was one of eight organisers of the 'International Symposium on Algebraic Topology' held in Mexico City at the National Autonomous University of Mexico in August\n1956\nin memory of\nWitold Hurewicz\n. The other seven organisers were\nJosé Adem\n,\nAlberto Barajas\n,\nSolomon Lefschetz\n, Emilio Lluis,\nAlfonso Nápoles Gándara\n,\nFélix Recillas\nand Guillermo Torres. The papers at this Symposium were given by the world's leading topologists, including:\nHenri Cartan\n,\nSamuel Eilenberg\n,\nJean-Pierre Serre\n,\nRené Thom\n,\nDonald Spencer\n,\nMichael Atiyah\n,\nShiing-shen Chern\n,\nJohn Milnor\n,\nFriedrich Hirzebruch\n,\nNorman Steenrod\n,\nIoan James\n,\nHenry Whitehead\n,\nEdwin Spanier\n,\nPeter Hilton\n,\nRaoul Bott\n,\nHans Samelson\n,\nHassler Whitney\nand\nJames Eells\n. This meeting with lectures by the world's leading topologists presented a remarkable opportunity to Vázquez.\nIn\n1959\nhe travelled to France as an Exchange Researcher, remaining there until February\n1960\n. While there he attended the\nHenri Cartan\nSeminar at the\nHenri Poincaré\nInstitute. The\nAnales del Instituto de Matemáticas\nbegan publication in\n1961\nwith Vázquez as a member of the Editorial Board from Volume\n1\n. He remained on the Editorial Board until\n1984\nwhen he was still an editor of Volume\n24\n.\nWe quote from\n[\n8\n]\nconcerning a major change in the direction of Vázquez's research, beginning in the\n1960\ns:-\nIn the\n1960\ns, there was a shift in his research work, prompted, among other things, by a seminar organised at the Institute of Mathematics, in which\nJosé Adem\nand\nFélix Recillas\nparticipated, and in which the homological algebra book of\nCartan\nand\nEilenberg\nwas studied. It was then that Vázquez began to study problems about projective modules and flat modules, and began to head towards the branch of categorical topology, of which he is one of the creators ... It is in this branch that his most important production is framed, especially highlighting the categorical conceptualisation of the connectedness property, which extends from geometric objects to arbitrary objects in a connection category. Of importance at this stage was his collaboration with the brilliant mathematician\nGraciela Salicrup\n, who died as a result of a tragic accident. She wrote her undergraduate thesis with Dr Vázquez and later began a joint research project with him, part of which gave rise to the thesis with which she obtained her doctorate. Their joint research continued for several years, yielding important results in connection theory.\nHorst Herrlich\n(1937\n-\n2015)\n, also a pioneer of categorical topology, was Professor of Mathematics at the University of Bremen from\n1971\n. He writes about the joint work of Vázquez and\nGraciela Salicrup\nexplaining that they\n[\n4\n]\n:-\n... were among the first mathematicians who realised that certain topological concepts and constructions were best understood in the light of category theory. ... they analysed topological problems by means of categorical terms and methods, in many cases having first to develop the yet missing categorical machinery. For nearly a decade they produced roughly one joint paper per year, evincing a high sensitivity for suitable problems, and demonstrating great originality and skill. Their best papers of this period ... are prominent achievements in the newly emerging field of categorical topology. Unfortunately they published their results in a journal neither well known nor easily accessible in the non-Spanish speaking mathematical world. Thus, their work which otherwise would have had a considerable impact on categorical topologists - remained for a long time almost unknown, and several of their results had to be recovered independently by later investigators.\nIn fact Vázquez wrote eleven papers between\n1970\nand\n1979\n, all being joint with\nGraciela Salicrup\n. Their joint paper\nConnection categories\nwas published in\n1972\n.\nVázquez lectured on topology for his whole career after he began research on the topic. Of course he taught other topics but it was his beautifully presented lectures on topology, together with his work as a thesis advisor, which was the main influence in building a strong Mexican research group in the subject. His lectures were very formal affairs, well organised and presented. One of his students wrote\n[\n12\n]\n:-\nThe truth is that he never dictated an agenda to us or pointed out long-term objectives. From the first day that I found myself in the student-teacher relationship with him, I learned topology; precisely the definition of this illustrated with examples. When he took us on trust, sometimes the most he would say to us when starting a topic was: \"we're going to be in this as far as we go.\"\nHe appeared to his students as rather humourless but his friends commented on his keen sense of humour and a certain irony in his vision of the world around him. His life seemed completely dominated by mathematics but he enjoyed baroque music and had a great love of animals.\nAlfonso Nápoles Gándara\nwas the first director of the Institute of Mathematics, then in\n1966\nVázquez replaced him holding this position until\n1972\n. In\n1984\nVázquez retired and was made an Emeritus Researcher. He continued to undertake research and had five papers published between\n1985\nand\n1992\n. He never stopped working even in his final illness and while at home, hoping his health would improve, he wrote six manuscripts. His writing had deteriorated by the time he wrote the last two suggesting that by this time his hand must have trembled. His mind, however, remained clear and the mathematics looked good quality.\nOn\n25\nFebruary\n1994\nthe\nMexican Mathematical Society\norganised a meeting to pay a tribute to Vázquez\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nMany of us attended with the hope of seeing him, but his delicate health prevented him from going and his daughter Isabel attended in his place. A toast was made in his honour, music was played\n(\nthere was a flute, and there was also a guitar\n)\n, a pretty young lady sang old songs in French, speeches were made ... We never saw him again.\nLet us note that his excellent contributions were recognised with the award of the  \"Luis Elizondo\" Scientific Prize in\n1986\n:-\nThe Tecnológico de Monterrey Luis Elizondo Award for a Humanistic Outlook was established in\n1967\nwith a personal contribution from Don Luis to Tecnológico de Monterrey. The award recognises prestigious researchers who have worked for the benefit of Mexico, as well as people and institutions who have devoted their humanitarian, fraternal work to their fellow human beings, have performed outstanding scientific and technological activity and carry out their philanthropic work in the Mexican community, all of whom have profiles similar to that of the Nuevo León philanthropist, Don Luis Elizondo.\nHe was also awarded the prize for Exact Science Research by the National Autonomous University of Mexico in\n1989\n.\nFinally let us note that in some ways the career of Roberto Vázquez was different from that of most university professors. He wrote an outstanding undergraduate level textbook when he was around\n30\nyears of age, yet despite its continuing popularity and many editions, he never wrote another undergraduate textbook. It is also unusual that his most important research contributions were made when he was in his late\n50\ns and early\n60\ns.",
