  "biografia": "Cesare Arzelà\ncame from a family of limited financial means. He attended the\nGymnasium\nin Sarzana for the two years\n1856\n-\n58\n. Sarzana is a town about\n8\nkm south of Santo Stefano di Magra\n(\nthe town of his birth\n)\nand about the same distance east of the coastal town of La Spezia. From there he went to the Lyceum in Pisa, where he spent the three years\n1858\n-\n61\n. Having won an entrance competition for the Scuola Normale Superiore of Pisa which gave him a scholarship, he began his studies there as a student of mathematical and physical sciences in November\n1861\n. We note that this was a period of transition for education in Italy, with the newly unified country taking over the regulation of colleges and many changes occurred during Arzelà's four years of study. He also studied at the University of Pisa and his thesis was directed by\nEnrico Betti\nwho held the chair of analysis and higher geometry at the University of Pisa.\nBetti\nwas also director of its teacher's college which Arzelà was attending, the Scuola Normale Superiore, from\n1864\n. In\n1869\nArzelà graduated having completed work on his dissertation on potential theory.\nAfter graduating, Arzelà continued to attend courses in higher analysis, mathematical physics, and higher mechanics while continuing to work for the certificate from the Scuola Normale Superiore which would allow him to become a secondary school teacher. He was awarded the certificate in July\n1870\nand, in September of that year, he began his teaching career at the Lyceum of Macerata. He published\nSopra alcune applicazioni di una formula data da Jacobi\nⓉ\n(\nOn some applications of a given formula of Jacobi\n)\nin\n1871\n. After working for two years in Macerata, he applied for leave of absence so that he might continue his studies in Pisa. He returned to Pisa for the academic year\n1872\n-\n73\n, attending a course on elasticity given by\nBetti\nand a course on the theory of functions of a real variable given by\nUlisse Dini\n. During this year\n[\n6\n]\n:-\nArzelà wrote an elegant paper on the deformation of an elastic ellipsoid and solved an important problem on the study of the elastic deformation of the earth.\nThe title of this paper was\nDeformatione di un' ellissoide omogene elastico isotropo\nⓉ\n(\nDeformations of homogenous elastic isotropic ellipsoid\n)\n. He also published\nSviluppo, in serie ordinate secondo le potenze decrescenti della variabile, di n funzioni algebriche definite da altrettante equazioni a coefficienti determinati\nⓉ\n(\nDevelopment, in series ordered according to decreasing powers of the variable, n algebraic functions defined by as many equations with given coefficients\n)\nin\n1873\n. Leaving Pisa after studying there for a year, Arzelà taught in Savona. He left there to take up a teaching position at the technical institute in Como then, in\n1875\n, he went to Florence where he taught mathematics at the Instituto Tecnico. There were two students that Arzelà taught at the Instituto Tecnico in Florence who turned out to play an important role in his future. These were Rodolfo Bettazzi\n(1867\n-\n1941)\nand\nVito Volterra\n- both became university teachers\n(\nin\nVolterra\n's case becoming a mathematician of top international importance\n)\nand went from being Arzelà's students to becoming colleagues and friends.\nThe University of Palermo had a vacancy for a professorship of algebra which, in the Italian tradition, was filled by asking people to compete for the post. Arzelà came out on top and took up the position in\n1878\n. During the years that Arzelà had been working his way towards a university post he had been making use of his teaching experiences writing a textbook. He published\nTrattato di algebra elementare ad uso dei licei\nⓉ\n(\nTreatise on elementary algebra for high-school students\n)\nin\n1880\nseven years after beginning to collect material. He had also worked on the theory of equations publishing the paper\nSopra la teoria dell' eliminazione algebraica x\nⓉ\n(\nOn the theory of  algebraic elimination\n)\nin\n1877\n. Arzelà only taught at Palermo for two years for, having entered a competition for a professorship at the University of Bologna, he was appointed as professor of Infinitesimal Calculus in\n1880\n. In\n1884\nhe became a full professor at Bologna when he was appointed to the Chair of Higher Analysis.\nSalvatore Pincherle\nwas appointed as a professor at the University of Bologna in\n1881\nso the department was greatly strengthened by these appointments and it was only due to them that Bologna could award degrees in mathematics\n[\n6\n]\n:-\nDuring the\n1870\ns, students at Bologna could not obtain a degree in mathematics because of the lack of professors capable of teaching the high-level courses of the last two years of the curriculum. Beginning in\n1881\n, students could finally complete these studies and earn their degrees in mathematics. This change resulted from the addition of excellent professors to the faculty with the express objective of bringing Bologna's mathematics teaching up to international standards.\nThe two new professors undertook research in analysis, Arzelà concentrating on the theory of functions of a real variable while\nPincherle\nconcentrated on analytic functions using the approach by\nWeierstrass\n[\n6\n]\n:-\nArzelà did his most important scientific work during his Bolognese period. He elaborated the concept of stepwise uniform convergence which gives a necessary and sufficient condition for a series of continuous functions to converge to a continuous function\n(1883)\n, and he proved the term-wise integration theorem for a series of functions using the\nRiemann\nintegral\n(1885)\n.\nIn fact he published three papers in\n1885\n:\nSulla integrazione per serie\nⓉ\n(\nOn  integration by series\n)\n;\nSulla integrabilità di una serie di funzioni\nⓉ\n(\nOn the integrability of a series of functions\n)\n; and\nSui prodotti infiniti\nⓉ\n(\nOn  infinite products\n)\n. It was four years later that he published the result for which he is best known today in his paper\nSulle funzioni di linee\nⓉ\n(\nOn line functions\n)\n(1895)\n. He proved the result now known as the Ascoli-Arzelà theorem on the existence of a uniformly convergent subsequence in every sequence of equilimited and equicontinuous functions. Both Giulio Ascoli and Arzelà had studied the concept of equicontinuity and Arzelà's theorem was a generalisation of a much weaker one which had been proved by Ascoli in\n1884\n. Veronica Gavagna gives details in\n[\n5\n]\nof some of the\n96\nletters which Arzelà wrote to\nVolterra\nover a\n30\n-year period. These give interesting information about Arzelà's research, and in particular his research in\nfunctional analysis\nwhich the two mathematicians refer to as \"functions of lines\" in their correspondence. Notice the title of Arzelà's paper\nSulle funzioni di linee\nⓉ\n(\nOn line functions\n)\nin which the Ascoli-Arzelà theorem appears. Also in this\n1895\npaper Arzelà expressed the hope that he would be able to apply his results to justify the\nDirichlet\nprinciple. In fact in the following year\n(1886)\nhe published his attempts to use his theorem to prove the\nDirichlet\nprinciple which he achieved but only by having imposed some extra conditions. Notice that today the Ascoli-Arzelà theorem is a result about compactness but this idea was only introduced by\nMaurice Fréchet\nin\n1904\n.\nArzelà continued to produce high quality research papers throughout his life. Those produced in his last few years include:\nSul limite di un integrale doppio\nⓉ\n(\nOn the limit of a double integral\n)\n(1907)\n;\nSul teorema di Borel\nⓉ\n(\nOn a theorem of Borel\n)\n(1909)\n; and\nSu alcune questioni di calcolo funzionale\nⓉ\n(\nOn some questions of functional calculus\n)\n(1910)\n.\nThe interesting papers\n[\n6\n]\nand\n[\n7\n]\nby Laura Martini, discuss a course on\nGalois theory\ngiven by Arzelà at the University of Bologna in session\n1886\n-\n87\n. This course was attended by\nEttore Bortolotti\nand the notes he took have survived. This course by Arzelà was the first course on\nGalois theory\nto be given in Italy. It is interesting to see the material on which Arzelà based his course:\nLejeune Dirichlet\n's\nVorlensungen über Zahlentheorie\nⓉ\n(\nLectures on number theory\n)\n;\nJoseph Serret\n's\nCours d'algèbre supérieure\nⓉ\n(\nA course on advanced algebra\n)\n,\nCamille Jordan\n's\nTraité des substitutions\nⓉ\n(\nTreatise on substitutions\n)\nand\nEugen Netto\n's\nSubstitutionentheorie\nⓉ\n(\nSubstitution theory\n)\n. The book by\nNetto\nclearly had clearly made the biggest impression on Arzelà who\n[\n6\n]\n:-\n... assessed the various presentations; he chose what he viewed as the best of the best; he altered and elaborated on those presentations in full knowledge of the needs of his student auditors. In so doing, he succeeded brilliantly in organizing a cogent and pedagogically sound course of lectures that at the same time reflected his own understanding of the algebraic subject matter.\nIn the year long course of lectures Arzelà proved that equations of degree greater than four cannot be solved by radicals. Rather surprisingly, after giving the proof he writes \"this proof was given for the first time by\nRuffini\n\". Since details of\nRuffini\n's proofs were not widely known or available when Arzelà gave his course, Martini is led to conclude\n[\n7\n]\n:-\nIt is possible that Arzelà had read\nRuffini\n's first proof which, after all, had been published privately in Bologna and which was well-known to several of\nRuffini\n's Italian contemporaries in mathematics.\nWe mentioned above Arzelà's school text which he wrote in\n1880\nbut this is not the only school or undergraduate text he wrote\n[\n6\n]\n:-\n... in\n1880\n, Arzelà had written one of the most widely used secondary school texts. His 'Trattato di algebra elementare'\nⓉ\n(\nTreatise on elementary algebra\n)\nwent into many editions and was extensively utilized as a textbook for almost\n30\nyears. He also wrote 'Complementi di algebra elementare'\nⓉ\n(\nSupplements on elementary algebra\n)\n(1896)\nand\n(\nwith G Ingrami\n)\n'Aritmetica razionale'\nⓉ\n(\nRational arithmetic\n)\n(1894)\nfor the secondary school audience in addition to the university-level text, 'Lezioni di calcolo infinitesimale'\nⓉ\n(\nLessons on infinitesimal calculus\n)\n(1901\n-\n06)\n, which encompasses the lectures on infinitesimal calculus given at the University of Bologna beginning in the academic year\n1880\n-\n1881\n. Arzelà thus commands an important position in the history of the teaching of mathematics in Italy both at the secondary and at the university level.\nNotice that\nLezioni di calcolo infinitesimale\nⓉ\n(\nLessons on infinitesimal calculus\n)\nwas a two-volume work, the first of the volumes appearing in\n1901\nand the second in\n1906\n. All the teaching texts by Arzelà are discussed in\n[\n4\n]\n.\nWe have mentioned that\nSalvatore Pincherle\nwas a colleague of Arzelà's at the University of Bologna but we should also mention that\nFederigo Enriques\nbecame a colleague in\n1896\n. Among the students that Arzelà taught at Bologna who became leading mathematicians, in addition to\nBortolotti\nwho we mentioned above, we should add the names of\nLeonida Tonelli\nand\nGiuseppe Vitali\n.\nFinally let us mention that Arzelà was elected to the\nReale Accademia dei Lincei\nand, in\n1907\n, shared with\nGuido Castelnuovo\nthe Royal Prize for Mathematics of\n10\n,\n000\nlire given by the\nReale Accademia dei Lincei\n.",
