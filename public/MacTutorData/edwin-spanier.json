  "summary": "Edwin Spanier was an American mathematician who worked in algebraic topology. He wrote one of the standard textbooks in the subject.",
  "biografia": "Edwin Spanier\nattended the University of Minnesota, graduating in\n1941\n. The Second World War meant that Spanier spent three years doing army service before studying for his doctorate. This army service was in the U.S. Signal Corps.\nAfter his three years of army service, Spanier studied for his doctorate at the University of Michigan. Spanier's doctoral supervisor was Norman\nSteenrod\nand under his supervision Spanier wrote a thesis on\nalgebraic topology\nfor which he was awarded his doctorate in\n1947\n. The following year Spanier spent as a research fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton. Then in\n1948\nhe was appointed to the faculty of the University of Chicago.\nDuring the time he held a post at Chicago, Spanier spent the year\n1952\n-\n53\nin Paris supported by a Guggenheim Fellowship, and the year\n1958\n-\n59\nas a member of the Institute for Advanced Study. Then in\n1959\nSpanier was appointed as professor of mathematics at Berkeley. At Berkeley, Spanier built up a strong group working in geometry and\ntopology\nby several appointments of topologists to the faculty of Berkeley and also by attracting many top topologists to spend periods as visitors at Berkeley.\nFrom the time of his doctoral work until around the time of the publication of his classic teext\nalgebraic topology\nin\n1966\n, Spanier work almost exclusively on algebraic topology. His first important paper on\nBorsuk\n's cohomotopy groups was published in the Annals of Mathematics in\n1949\n. This work gave an algebraic classification of maps from polyhedra to spheres.\nChern\nwas appointed professor of geometry at Chicago in\n1949\n, the year following Spanier's appointment, and the two began the study of\nhomology groups\nof fibre spaces with their joint paper\nThe homology structure of sphere bundles\nin\n1950\n. Spanier began joint work with\nHenry Whitehead\nand in a series of papers they introduced the method of duality in\nhomotopy theory\n. The range of his work is described in\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nIn all, Spanier published more than forty papers in algebraic topology, contributing to most of the major research areas in the field, including\ncohomology operations\n, obstruction theory, homotopy theory, imbeddability of polyhedra in Euclidean spaces, and topology of function spaces. Many of his results are now standard tools in all fields that untilize global geometrical reasoning. These include not only various subjects in pure mathematics, but also diverse areas in applied mathematics, including computer science, mathematical physics, economic models, and\ngame theory\n. Interestingly, one of Spanier's theories, now called\nAlexander\n-Spanier homology, is currently being applied to analyse\ndifferential equations\n- a return to\nPoincaré\n's original use of algebraic topology.\nWe have suggested that his work on algebraic topology went on until around the time that his famous book was published in\n1966\n. However, he began to collaborate on work on formal languages from about\n1961\nonwards. This work is of major importance in theoretical computer science, and also has applications in other areas such as the theory of\ndynamical systems\n.\nSpanier had an outstanding reputation as a lecturer and writer, his lectures and publications being\n[\n1\n]\n:-\n... characterised by unusual lucidity and precision and an even rarer naturalness and simplicity. No matter how complex the subject, at the end the reader feels the theorems are the right ones, the hypotheses natural, and the methods as simple as possible.\nSpanier returned to algebraic topology for the publications in the last years of his life. In fact his final publication returned to the topic of his first, namely the axioms which\nEilenberg\nand\nSteenrod\nproposed for homology theory.",
