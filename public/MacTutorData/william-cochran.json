  "biografia": "William Cochran\nwas the son of Thomas Cochran\n(1875\n-\n1943)\nand Jean Willock Gemmell\n(1878\n-\n1949)\n, known as Jeannie. Thomas had been born in Camlachie, Glasgow, on\n21\nJune\n1875\n, the son of Oliver Cochran and Isabella Coventry Duncan. In the\n1891\nScottish Census, Thomas is living with his parents at\n18\nUnion Place, Rutherglen, Lanarkshire, Scotland and is working as a railway clerk. Thomas was the eldest of his parents seven children, with siblings Oliver\n(\nage\n13)\n, John\n(\nage\n12)\n, Isabella\n(\nage\n10)\n, Alexander\n(\nage\n7)\n, David\n(\nage\n3)\nand Andrew\n(\nage\n2)\n. Jeannie had been born in Bridgeton, Glasgow, on\n15\nJune\n1878\n, the daughter of William Gemmell and Jane Willock. Thomas and Jeannie were married at the Royal Institute of Fine Art, Blythswood, Glasgow on\n29\nJune\n1906\n. They had two sons, Oliver Cochran, born in Rutherglen on\n24\nFebruary\n1908\nand William Gemmell Cochran, the subject of this biography, born in Rutherglen on\n15\nJuly\n1909\n. William Cochran was known as Willie to his family but later in life was known as Bill to his friends and colleagues.\nOliver Cochran provided information about his brother's childhood for the biography\n[\n45\n]\n:-\nOliver has colourful recollections of their childhood. At age five, Willie\n(\npronounced Wully\n)\n, as he was known to family and friends, was hospitalised for a burst appendix, and his life hung in the balance for a day. But soon he was home, wearying his family with snatches of German taught him by a German patient in his nursing-home ward. Willie had a knack for hearing or reading something and remembering it. Oliver recalls that throughout his life, Willie would walk or sit around reciting poems, speeches, advertisements, music hall songs, and in later life oratorios and choral works he was learning.\nHis childhood was happy but the family lived in difficult conditions. Their home had only one bedroom which the parents slept in, and the two boys had to sleep in a room which was also where the family cooked and ate. He had to walk over a mile to his local school, doing that walk four times a day since he came home for lunch. When he was sixteen years old the family moved to a better home and life became easier. Cochran won many prizes when at school, not only mathematics prizes and medals but also prizes in his other subjects. He was highly competitive and always aimed to be first. He attended Gourock High School and Glasgow High School, winning the mathematics medal from both, the first in\n1924\nand the second in\n1927\n[\n45\n]\n:-\nWillie had no absorbing hobbies as a boy, although he dabbled in many things. Cycling, hiking, and walking in the hills were his chief physical activities. Later, studying and reading became primary. His scholastic prowess won him many books as prizes and created an extensive home library.\nCochran took the University of Glasgow Bursary Competition in\n1927\nand he was placed first. This Competition was open to all pupils in Scotland and required students to take papers in a wide variety of subjects; Cochran took papers on English, Latin, mathematics, natural philosophy\n(\nas physics was called at that time, and still was when I\n[\nEFR\n]\nwas a student in Scotland in the\n1960\ns\n)\n, and chemistry. The award of a bursary allowed him to take his first degree at the University of Glasgow which certainly would not have been possible without this financial support. He was awarded an M.A. in mathematics and physics in\n1931\n. It was, and still is, the tradition that Scottish universities award an MA as a first degree where English, and other, universities award a B.A. He won the Logan Medal for the best student in the Faculty of Arts and won the George A Clark Scholarship to study mathematics at Cambridge. This scholarship had been funded by George Aitken Clark\n(1823\n-\n1873)\n, a Scottish manufacturer; it was awarded by the University of Glasgow and funded four years of study. Cochran was accepted to study the mathematical tripos at St John's College Cambridge.\nAt Cambridge he took the standard tripos courses, attending lectures by\nG H Hardy\nand\nAbram Besicovitch\nas well as having\nEbenezer Cunningham\n,\nMax Newman\nand\nSydney Goldstein\nas advisors at St John's College. He also chose, as an elective course,\nJohn Wishart\n's course in mathematical statistics, then proceeded to take a practical course in the School of Agriculture. Although Cochran was renowned as a very hard worker, he did find time at Cambridge to have other interests. He\n[\n85\n]\n:-\n... was a member of the St Johns Music Club, sang in the choir, and attended concerts.\nHe also played badminton once a week with Anton Hales\n(1911\n-\n2006)\n, a fellow mathematical tripos student who became a leading geophysicist. They always followed their game with tea and oatcakes.\nCochran was a\nWrangler\n(\nFirst Class student\n)\nin the\n1933\nMathematical Tripos and continued studying at Cambridge for a doctorate. His first two papers, published in\n1934\n, show the influence of two of his lecturers, namely\nGoldstein\nand\nWishart\n. The first of the two papers,\nThe flow due to a rotating disc\n, was influenced by\nGoldstein\nand considers the steady motion of an incompressible viscous fluid due to an infinite rotating plane lamina. The other\n1934\npaper\nThe distribution of quadratic forms in a normal system, with applications to the analysis of covariance\ncontains what today is known as \"Cochran's Theorem\". It has the following Abstract:-\nMany of the most frequently used applications of the theory of statistics, such for example as the methods of analysis of variance and covariance, the general test of multiple regression and the test of a regression coefficient, depend essentially on the joint distribution of several quadratic forms in a univariate normal system. The object of this paper is to prove the main-relevant results about this distribution. As an application of these results, the theory involved in the method of analysis of covariance will be investigated.\nFrank Yates\nwrites about this paper in\n[\n90\n]\n:-\nAlthough elegant mathematically, it is perhaps doubtful whether his results were of much practical value; certainly, as Cochran himself recognised in his paper, they did nothing to resolve the question of exact tests of significance in analyses of covariance, which had been bothering\nWishart\n, and which was the practical motivation for the paper.\nIn\n1934\nR A Fisher\nleft Rothamsted Experimental Station to accept the\nGalton\nchair at University College, London and\nFrank Yates\nbecame head at Rothamsted. Cochran was offered the vacant post but he was still not finished his doctoral course at Cambridge.\nYates\nlater wrote\n(\nsee\n[\n85\n]\n)\n:-\n... it was a measure of good sense that he accepted my argument that a PhD, even from Cambridge, was little evidence of research ability, and that Cambridge had at that time little to teach him in statistics that could not be much better learnt from practical work in a research institute.\nCochran accepted the post at Rothamsted where he worked for five years on experimental designs and sample survey techniques. During this time he worked closely with\nYates\n. He also had the chance to work with\nFisher\nwho was a frequent visitor to Rothamsted.\nYates\nwrites\n[\n90\n]\n:-\nCochran came to Rothamsted at an opportune time.\nFisher\n's new ideas on experimental design and analysis, which had been developed in the\n1920\ns and with which I was particularly involved in my work at Rothamsted, were finding increasing recognition at other research institutes, both in the United Kingdom and overseas. Cochran worked closely with me in their further development and in their application to the research problems of Rothamsted, and through our association with agronomic research workers in overseas dependencies to the problems of tropical agriculture.\nAt Rothamsted, Cochran met Betty Irene May Mitchell\n(1910\n-\n2002)\nwho was an entomologist. Betty had been born in Beckenham, Kent, the daughter of Forbes Tarrant Mitchell, a Carpet Warehouseman, and his wife Alice May Dance. On\n17\nJuly\n1937\n, Cochran married Betty at St Columba's Church of Scotland, Pont Street, London; they lived at\n70\nLuton Road, Harpenden, Hertfordshire. William Cochran sailed from Southampton to New York on the\nNormandie\n, departing\n5\nOctober\n1938\n. He was on his way to the Iowa Statistical Laboratory, in Ames, Iowa, which had been established at the Iowa State College in\n1933\nby\nGeorge W Snedecor\n.\nSnedecor\nhad already published two works which would become classics,\nCalculation and Interpretation of Analysis of Variance and Covariance\n(1934)\nand\nStatistical Methods\n(1937)\n. Cochran travelled alone to the United States since his wife was expecting their first child. On\n26\nOctober\n1938\nthe Cochrans' first child was stillborn at the Nursing Home in Harpenden. Betty Cochran went to join her husband at Ames, sailing from Southampton to New York on the\nAquitania\narriving on\n9\nDecember\n1938\n.\nCochran and his wife left the United States sailing from New York on the ship\nWashington\nto Plymouth, England arriving on\n25\nJanuary\n1939\n. He had already agreed to return to the University of Iowa to teach during the\n1939\n-\n40\nacademic session but as an imminent war seemed increasingly impossible to avoid, he felt that leaving Europe at such a time was not the right thing to do. Torn between breaking his promise to Iowa or leaving his country at a critical time, he eventually decided that he must keep his promise. Before leaving Britain, the Cochrans went to Glasgow to visit Cochran's relations. William and Betty Cochran sailed on the ship\nMontrose\nfrom Greenock, Scotland to Quebec, Canada departing on\n26\nAugust\n1939\n. They gave their UK address as\n11\nHampden Terrace, Glasgow. While at Ames, the Cochrans' two children were born; Elizabeth\n(\nborn\n25\nApril\n1940)\nand Alexander Charles\n(\nborn\n24\nApril\n1942)\n.\nFrom autumn\n1939\n, with a permanent position of professor at Ames, Iowa, Cochran's task was to develop the graduate programme in statistics within the Mathematics Department. His first two lecture courses were on sample surveys and experimental design. These would be developed over the following years until they formed the basis of his two classic books.\nFor extracts from reviews of Cochran's books see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nRichard L Anderson\n(1915\n-\n2003)\n, who became a professor of statistics at North Carolina State University and the University of Kentucky, writes\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nProfessor Cochran's lectures were gems of clarity, conciseness and rigour, interspersed with many real-world examples. In addition, he was a fountain of information on how to tackle seemingly insolvable problems. When he came to Iowa State, I was well on my way with research on the distribution of the serial correlation coefficient. One day in the winter of\n1940\n, I presented my up-to-then results to the seminar we often held after tea; the distribution theory\n(\nbased on characteristic functions\n)\nwas so complicated that closed-form solutions seemed intractable for\nN\n>\n9\nN > 9\nN\n>\n9\n. The next morning I found on my desk a short note from W G C, which went something like this: \"I believe you might find my article on the distribution of quadratic forms helpful.\" This referred to Cochran's Theorem, published in\n1934\n. I suppose what he really meant was that if I had stayed awake in class, I would have tried it out before then. In any event Cochran's Theorem was the solution to all my problems.\nFrank Yates\nwrites\n[\n90\n]\n:-\nCochran's appointment to Iowa State greatly furthered the spread of sound experimental techniques in agriculture and biology in America. For the first time he was involved in teaching and rapidly showed his abilities in this direction. His stay at Ames saw the genesis of his book on experimental design and analysis, in collaboration with\nGertrude Cox\n, who had already been collecting examples illustrating the Fisherian techniques. This was eventually published in\n1950\nand rapidly became the standard textbook on the subject. He also did much to popularise the use of quasi-factorial and lattice designs for varietal trials and published a number of papers on them.\nGeoffrey S Watson\n(1921\n-\n1998)\nquotes Alexander McFarlane Mood's thoughts on Cochran in\n[\n85\n]\n[\nNote: Mood\n(1913\n-\n2009)\nwas a statistical consultant and professor at Iowa State for many years and received several awards for his work in statistics\n]\n:-\nAlmost from the day he arrived\n[\nat Ames\n]\n[\nCochran\n]\nwas the pre-eminent statistical consultant in the U.S. He was marvellous at it and to my judgment in a class by himself. No one else had the breadth of experience with data from so many fields of statistical investigation; no one else had such universal knowledge of statistical techniques; probably no one else was such a comprehensive reader of statistical journals. ... The courses at Ames, although taught in the mathematics department, were quite unmathematical. Somehow, people introduced to statistics by\nSnedecor\n's book developed very good insights as to how to partition, purely arithmetically, sums of squares associated with very elaborate designs. Even the advanced sampling and design courses used essentially no mathematics or probability theory or mathematical statistics.\nIn\nYates\n' quote above, he writes of Cochran's collaboration with\nGertrude Cox\n. Let us quote Cochran's own thoughts on this from\n[\n19\n]\n:-\nGertrude and I were on the faculty of the Statistical Laboratory at Iowa State College during the years\n1938\n-\n40\n. ... In\n1940\nshe had a paper in the 'Annals' on the construction of balanced incomplete blocks, and we had a joint paper with R C Eckhardt on lattices and triple lattices. She was also assembling her series of typed, mimeographed notes on standard designs. Each note indicated the kind of experiment for which the design was suitable and gave an example of its use, with the arithmetic needed to do the analysis and summarise the results. These notes led to the book 'Experimental Designs', published in\n1950\n. I don't remember when or how we decided to write a book; the suggestion may have come from\nWalter Shewhart\n, who was then advising Wiley's on a series of books on statistics. Our division of labour was easily agreed upon. Since Gertrude disliked the job of writing even more than I did, she took responsibility for the experimental plans, and I took primary responsibility for the descriptive text and any hidden theory.\nIn\n1943\nCochran was seconded to\nSamuel Wilks\n' research team at Princeton where he was involved in war work examining probabilities of hits in naval warfare. By\n1945\nhe was working on bombing raid strategies. Anderson writes in\n[\n19\n]\n:-\nIn\n1945\nhe was asked to serve on a select team of statisticians to evaluate the efficacy of the World War II bombing raids. This was only the first of many blue-ribbon committees on which he was to serve. Cochran was instrumental in persuading me to join the Princeton group. I remember with pleasure the Sunday afternoon teas at the Cochran-Mood residence; the two families occupied one of Princeton's huge houses. It was there that I discovered that Cochran was an excellent badminton player. I could never understand how a man could be so good at badminton and so terrible at tennis. Later I was to discover in Raleigh that he and Betty were also barn-dance enthusiasts.\nCochran joined the newly created North Carolina Institute of Statistics in\n1946\n, again to develop the graduate programme in statistics. The Cochrans' third child, Theresa, was born in North Carolina in\n1946\n. While at North Carolina, Cochran was on the Organising Committee which set up the Biometric Society. He wrote in\n[\n17\n]\n:-\nIn the founding of the Biometric Society, a wise decision was taken to regard biometry as roughly synonymous with quantitative biology and as a discipline requiring the cooperation of biologists, mathematicians, and statisticians. ... The Biometric Society has the opportunity to play an important role in the future development of biometry.\n[\nThe\n]\nreminder that our society is an experiment in cooperation, and one where success will be difficult to attain, is wise. I hope that the scope of the Society will continue to be conceived broadly and that biologists and mathematicians will have their share of responsibility in determining our future activities. Finally, I hope that we will set an example in international cooperation.\nFrom\n1949\nuntil\n1957\nhe was at Johns Hopkins University in the chair of biostatistics. Here he was more involved in medical applications of statistics rather than the agricultural application he had studied earlier. From\n1957\nuntil he retired in\n1976\nCochran was at Harvard. His initial task was to help set up a statistics department, something which he had a great deal of experience with by this time. He had almost become a professional at starting statistics within universities in the USA.\nWriting about graduate training in statistics, he writes\n[\n15\n]\n:-\n... that statistics depends primarily on mathematics and mathematicians for its future development. Anyone interested in the progress of statistics cannot but hope that able young mathematicians will continue to be attracted into this field, which offers a wide range of useful and stimulating applications. Such mathematicians need not be regarded as lost or strayed from the fold. For while statistics has as yet contributed relatively little to repay its debt to mathematics, it is to be expected that new points of view and new problems arising in mathematical statistics will in course of time enrich the body of mathematical knowledge itself.\nCochran's books became classics and were widely used by scientists in many different disciplines. We present extracts from\n74\nreviews of his books at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nIn particular,\nContributions to statistics\n(1982)\ncontains over\n100\nresearch papers by Cochran and the reviews of this book give a good overview of the range of his contributions; see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nThe authors of\n[\n29\n]\nwrite about Cochran's abilities as a teacher:-\nCochran made friends easily and travelled widely. He was a gifted teacher, noted for the clarity, individuality, and carefulness of his lectures. He could be gruff in his rejoinders to students whose work fell below his high standards, but he was patiently encouraging, too. He was very much loved and revered for helping students and colleagues make substantial progress on seemingly intractable problems. His\n40\nor so PhD students include many leading applied statisticians. Several hundred admiring friends and associates from the world over attended his retirement banquet at the Harvard Club in Boston in\n1976\n.\nBarry Margolin writes\n[\n63\n]\n:-\nCochran possessed a particular gift for absorbing, synthesising, summarising and interpreting new statistical work, and a rare ability to communicate with practicing statisticians and other users of statistics; this is reflected in the more than one dozen expository papers that he wrote, reviewing advances in statistics and discussing the resultant changes in training needs for professional statisticians.\nCochran did much to promote statistics within the USA. Anderson in\n[\n2\n]\nsums up Cochran's contribution as follows:-\nCochran was that rarity, a man with both a keen mind and the desire to use it for the benefit of mankind. His office was always open to the struggling student, nonplussed scientist, or inquiring citizen. We who were benefitted by him offer our sincere thanks. To Betty and the children one can only say that the world is a better place because he was in it for a while.\nThe authors of\n[\n45\n]\nwrite:-\nPersonally, Bill was an unpretentious man with Scottish wit and humour. He was a believer in the fellowship of man, and one of the few things sure to elicit his anger was a bigoted comment. Although he preferred to work by himself rather than to collaborate with others, he was friendly to everyone and liked by all. He and his wife Betty, to the delight of colleagues and students, entertained frequently, and enjoyed square dancing, theatre, music, and travel. Hundreds of statisticians from far-flung places attended Bill's retirement dinner in\n1976\n. The last several years of Bill's life were plagued with a series of medical problems. Nonetheless, after his retirement and his move to his Cape Cod home, he continued to travel, to teach, and to write.\nCochran received many honours and awards for his outstanding contributions. He held a Guggenheim Fellowship in\n1964\n. He served as President of the International Statistical Institute, the\nAmerican Statistical Association\n, the Institute of Mathematical Statistics, and the Biometric Society. The\nRoyal Statistical Society\nelected him an honorary fellow in\n1959\nand he was elected to the\nNational Academy of Sciences\nin\n1974\n. In\n1967\nhe was awarded the\nS S Wilks\nMedal of the\nAmerican Statistical Association\n. Although he never completed his doctorate at Cambridge, he was awarded honorary doctorates from the University of Glasgow and Johns Hopkins University.\nHe died in Cape Cod Hospital in Hyannis, Massachusetts.",
