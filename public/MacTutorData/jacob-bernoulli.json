  "biografia": "Jacob Bernoulli\n's father, Nicolaus Bernoulli\n(1623\n-\n1708)\ninherited the spice business in Basel that had been set up by his own father, first in Amsterdam and then in Basel. The family, of Belgium origin, were refugees fleeing from persecution by the Spanish rulers of the Netherlands. Philip, the King of Spain, had sent the Duke of Alba to the Netherlands in\n1567\nwith a large army to punish those opposed to Spanish rule, to enforce adherence to Roman Catholicism, and to re-establish Philip's authority. Alba set up the Council of Troubles which was a court that condemned over\n12000\npeople but most, like the Bernoulli family who were of the Protestant faith, fled the country.\nNicolaus Bernoulli was an important citizen of Basel, being a member of the town council and a magistrate. Jacob Bernoulli's mother also came from an important Basel family of bankers and local councillors. Jacob Bernoulli was the brother of\nJohann Bernoulli\nand the uncle of\nDaniel Bernoulli\n. He was compelled to study philosophy and theology by his parents, which he greatly resented, and he graduated from the University of Basel with a master's degree in philosophy in\n1671\nand a licentiate in theology in\n1676\n.\nDuring the time that Jacob Bernoulli was taking his university degrees he was studying mathematics and astronomy against the wishes of his parents. It is worth remarking that this was a typical pattern for many of the Bernoulli family who made a study of mathematics despite pressure to make a career in other areas. However Jacob Bernoulli was the first to go down this road so for him it was rather different in that there was no tradition of mathematics in the family before Jacob Bernoulli. Later members of the family must have been much influenced by the tradition of studying mathematics and mathematical physics.\nIn\n1676\n, after taking his theology degree, Bernoulli moved to Geneva where he worked as a tutor. He then travelled to France spending two years studying with the followers of\nDescartes\nwho were led at this time by\nMalebranche\n. In\n1681\nBernoulli travelled to the Netherlands where he met many mathematicians including\nHudde\n. Continuing his studies with the leading mathematicians and scientists of Europe he went to England where, among others, he met\nBoyle\nand\nHooke\n. At this time he was deeply interested in astronomy and produced a work giving an incorrect theory of comets. As a result of his travels, Bernoulli began a correspondence with many mathematicians which he carried on over many years.\nJacob Bernoulli returned to Switzerland and taught mechanics at the University in Basel from\n1683\n, giving a series of important lectures on the mechanics of solids and liquids. Since his degree was in theology it would have been natural for him to turn to the Church, but although he was offered an appointment in the Church he turned it down. Bernoulli's real love was for mathematics and theoretical physics and it was in these topics that he taught and researched. During this period he studied the leading mathematical works of his time including\nDescartes\n'\nGéométrie\nand\nvan Schooten\n's additional material in the Latin edition. Jacob Bernoulli also studied the work of\nWallis\nand\nBarrow\nand through these he became interested in\ninfinitesimal\ngeometry. Jacob began publishing in the journal\nActa Eruditorum\nwhich was established in Leipzig in\n1682\n.\nIn\n1684\nJacob Bernoulli married Judith Stupanus. They were to have two children, a son who was given his grandfather's name of Nicolaus and a daughter. These children, unlike many members of the Bernoulli family, did not go on to become mathematicians or physicists.\nYou can see the Bernoulli family tree at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nOne of the most significant events concerning the mathematical studies of Jacob Bernoulli occurred when his younger brother,\nJohann Bernoulli\n, began to work on mathematical topics.\nJohann\nwas told by his father to study medicine but while he was studying that topic he asked his brother Jacob to teach him mathematics. Jacob Bernoulli was appointed professor of mathematics in Basel in\n1687\nand the two brothers began to study the calculus as presented by\nLeibniz\nin his\n1684\npaper on the differential calculus in\nNova Methodus pro Maximis et Minimis, itemque Tangentibus\n... published in\nActa Eruditorum\n. They also studied the publications of\nvon Tschirnhaus\n. It must be understood that\nLeibniz\n's publications on the calculus were very obscure to mathematicians of that time and the Bernoullis were the first to try to understand and apply\nLeibniz\n's theories.\nAlthough Jacob and\nJohann\nboth worked on similar problems their relationship was soon to change from one of collaborators to one of rivals.\nJohann Bernoulli\n's boasts were the first cause of Jacob's attacks on him and Jacob wrote that\nJohann\nwas his pupil whose only achievements were to repeat what his teacher had taught him. Of course this was a grossly unfair statement. Jacob continued to attack his brother in print in a disgraceful and unnecessary fashion, particularly after\n1697\n. However he did not reserve public criticism for his brother. He was critical of the university authorities at Basel and again he was very public in making critical statements that, as one would expect, left him in a difficult situation at the university. Jacob probably felt that\nJohann\nwas the more powerful mathematician of the two and, this hurt since Jacob's nature meant that he always had to feel that he was winning praise from all sides. Hofmann writes in\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nSensitivity, irritability, a mutual passion for criticism, and an exaggerated need for recognition alienated the brothers, of whom Jacob had the slower but deeper intellect.\nAs suggested by this quote the brothers were equally at fault in their quarrel.\nJohann\nwould have liked the chair of mathematics at Basel which Jacob held and he certainly resented having to move to Holland in\n1695\n. This was another factor in the complete breakdown of relations in\n1697\n.\nOf course the dispute between the brothers over who could obtain the greatest recognition was a particularly stupid one in the sense that both made contributions to mathematics of the very greatest importance. Whether the rivalry spurred them on to greater things or whether they might have achieved more had they continued their initial collaboration, it is impossible to say. We shall now examine some of the major contributions made by Jacob Bernoulli at an important stage in the development of mathematics following\nLeibniz\n's work on the calculus.\nJacob Bernoulli's first important contributions were a pamphlet on the parallels of logic and algebra published in\n1685\n, work on\nprobability\nin\n1685\nand geometry in\n1687\n. His geometry result gave a construction to divide any triangle into four equal parts with two perpendicular lines.\nBy\n1689\nhe had published important work on infinite series and published his law of large numbers in probability theory. The interpretation of probability as relative-frequency says that if an experiment is repeated a large number of times then the relative frequency with which an event occurs equals the probability of the event. The law of large numbers is a mathematical interpretation of this result. Jacob Bernoulli published five treatises on infinite series between\n1682\nand\n1704\n. The first two of these contained many results, such as fundamental result that\n∑\n(\n1\nn\n)\n\\sum  (\\Large\\frac{1}{n}\\normalsize )\n∑\n(\nn\n1\n​\n)\ndiverges, which Bernoulli believed were new but they had actually been proved by\nMengoli\n40\nyears earlier. Bernoulli could not find a closed form for\n∑\n(\n1\nn\n2\n)\n\\sum  (\\Large\\frac{1}{n^{2}\\normalsize} )\n∑\n(\nn\n2\n1\n​\n)\nbut he did show that it converged to a finite limit less than\n2\n.\nEuler\nwas the first to find the sum of this series in\n1737\n. Bernoulli also studied the exponential series which came out of examining compound interest.\nIn May\n1690\nin a paper published in\nActa Eruditorum\n, Jacob Bernoulli showed that the problem of determining the isochrone is equivalent to solving a first-order nonlinear\ndifferential equation\n. The isochrone, or curve of constant descent, is the curve along which a particle will descend under gravity from any point to the bottom in exactly the same time, no matter what the starting point. It had been studied by\nHuygens\nin\n1687\nand\nLeibniz\nin\n1689\n. After finding the differential equation, Bernoulli then solved it by what we now call separation of variables. Jacob Bernoulli's paper of\n1690\nis important for the history of calculus, since the term integral appears for the first time with its integration meaning. In\n1696\nBernoulli solved the equation, now called \"the Bernoulli equation\",\ny\n′\n=\np\n(\nx\n)\ny\n+\nq\n(\nx\n)\ny\nn\ny' = p(x)y + q(x)y^{n}\ny\n′\n=\np\n(\nx\n)\ny\n+\nq\n(\nx\n)\ny\nn\nand Hofmann describes this part of his work as:-\n... proof of Bernoulli's careful and critical work on older as well as on contemporary contributions to infinitesimal mathematics and of his perseverance and analytical ability in dealing with special pertinent problems, even those of a mechanical-dynamic nature.\nJacob Bernoulli also discovered a general method to determine\nevolutes\nof a curve as the\nenvelope\nof its circles of curvature. He also investigated caustic curves and in particular he studied these associated curves of the\nparabola\n, the logarithmic spiral and epicycloids around\n1692\n. The lemniscate of Bernoulli was first conceived by Jacob Bernoulli in\n1694\n. In\n1695\nhe investigated the drawbridge problem which seeks the curve required so that a weight sliding along the cable always keeps the drawbridge balanced.\nJacob Bernoulli's most original work was\nArs Conjectandi\npublished in Basel in\n1713\n, eight years after his death. The work was incomplete at the time of his death but it is still a work of the greatest significance in the theory of probability. In the book Bernoulli reviewed work of others on probability, in particular work by van\nSchooten\n,\nLeibniz\n, and Prestet. The\nBernoulli numbers\nappear in the book in a discussion of the exponential series. Many examples are given on how much one would expect to win playing various game of chance. There are interesting thoughts on what probability really is\n[\n1\n]\n:-\n... probability as a measurable degree of certainty; necessity and chance; moral versus mathematical expectation; a priori an a posteriori probability; expectation of winning when players are divided according to dexterity; regard of all available arguments, their valuation, and their calculable evaluation; law of large numbers ...\nIn\n[\n1\n]\nHofmann sums up Jacob Bernoulli's contributions as follows:-\nBernoulli greatly advanced algebra, the infinitesimal calculus, the\ncalculus of variations\n, mechanics, the theory of series, and the theory of probability. He was self-willed, obstinate, aggressive, vindictive, beset by feelings of inferiority, and yet firmly convinced of his own abilities. With these characteristics, he necessarily had to collide with his similarly disposed brother. He nevertheless exerted the most lasting influence on the latter.\nBernoulli was one of the most significant promoters of the formal methods of higher analysis. Astuteness and elegance are seldom found in his method of presentation and expression, but there is a maximum of integrity.\nJacob Bernoulli continued to hold the chair of mathematics at Basel until his death in\n1705\nwhen the chair was filled by his brother Johann. Jacob had always found the properties of the logarithmic spiral to be almost magical and he had requested that it be carved on his tombstone with the Latin inscription\nEadem Mutata Resurgo\nmeaning \"I shall arise the same though changed\".\nSee\nTHIS LINK\n.",
