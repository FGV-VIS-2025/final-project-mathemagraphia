  "biografia": "George Lusztig\n's name, in Romanian, was Gheorghe Lusztig. He was born into a Jewish family and brought up in Timișoara, a city in Romania where Hungarian and Romanian are both spoken. He said\n[\n22\n]\n:-\nI'm not religious but being Jewish played a role in my choice of mathematics, which seemed beyond the reach of politics, as well as the fact that it was an area where I had the best possible chance to be judged objectively.\nHe attended High School in Timișoara and represented Romania in the International Mathematical Olympiad in\n1962\nand\n1963\n, being awarded a Silver Medal on both occasions. In fact it was mathematics competitions at school which made him realise that he was talented in mathematics and gave him confidence in himself. In the High School, two foreign languages were compulsory, one of which had to be Russian but the other could be English, French or German; he chose French. He had to study Russian, however, from the\n4\nth grade until\n11\nth grade. While at the High School, he met and was influenced by, Maria Neumann\n(1905\n-\n2003)\nwho was an associate professor at the University of Timișoara. She was a Romanian mathematician, of Jewish origin, who undertook research in non-Euclidean geometries.\nLusztig graduated from the High School in Timișoara and began to study mathematics at the University of Bucharest. There he had, in addition to mathematics, to take other topics such as Marxist philosophy, political economy, Russian, physics and mechanics. Since the degree he was taking was basically designed to prepare school teachers, there were also courses on how to teach. He was taught mathematics by Kostake Teleman\n(1933\n-\n2007)\nwho Lusztig said was an excellent teacher. Another whom he learnt much from at this time was Dan Burghelea\n(\nborn\n1943)\n. Burghelea was a student at the University of Bucharest, graduating in mathematics in\n1965\nwith a thesis in algebraic topology. He obtained his Ph.D. in\n1968\nfrom the Institute of Mathematics of the Romanian Academy with a thesis on Hilbert manifolds.\nWhile still an undergraduate, Lusztig began publishing papers. His first two papers were\nA model of plane affine geometry over a finite field\n(\nRomanian\n)\n(1965)\nand\nConstruction of a universal bundle over arbitrary polyhedra\n(\nRomanian\n)\n(1966)\n. In the latter paper he extended the construction of a universal bundle over denumerable polyhedra given by\nJohn Milnor\nin\n1956\nto the case of arbitrary polyhedra. His method used the\nKelley\ntopologies. He graduated with a\nLicenta in Matematica\nin\n1968\n, and three more of his papers\n(\none written jointly with Henri Moscovici\n)\nwere published in that year; they were all written in French.\nAt this stage of his career he was told that he could not get a position higher than a high school teacher in Sibiu. He has no doubt that this was because he was Jewish since others, who had shown less mathematical talent, were given university positions in Bucharest. However, Dan Papuc, a professor at the University of Timișoara, offered him a university position in Timișoara which he gladly accepted. He realised, however, that there was no future for him in Romania and decided that when the first opportunity arose he would leave the country. He was allowed to attend a conference in Italy, and after that he went to England visiting Warwick University and spending two months at Oxford University during the autumn of\n1968\n. At Oxford, during his first meeting with\nMichael Atiyah\nand\nIsadore Singer\nthey asked him a question about the Kervaire semicharacteristic. He was able to answer the question but they had asked F P Peterson, who was at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the same question a couple of months earlier and it was soon discovered that he had found a similar solution. Although they had discovered that results independently, Peterson and Lusztig wrote a joint paper\nSemi-characteristics and cobordism\nwhich was published in\nTopology\nin\n1969\n.\nMichael Atiyah\nhad just been appointed professor of mathematics at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. He invited Lusztig to Princeton and, after he had returned to Timișoara, Lusztig applied for permission to go to Princeton. He had also received an invitation to attend a conference in Bonn, Germany, so he also sought permission to spend a week in Bonn. He was granted permission to attend the conference in Bonn but was refused permission to go to Princeton.\nIn\n1969\nhe went to the Bonn conference but, after the conference ended, did not return to Romania as he was supposed to do. Instead he went to the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton where he studied with\nMichael Atiyah\nfor two years. He was also registered as a Ph.D. student at Princeton University where he worked for his Ph.D. advised by\nWilliam Browder\n. He was awarded a doctorate by Princeton in May\n1971\nfor his thesis\nNovikov's Higher Signature and Families of Elliptic Operators\n. The thesis was published under the same title in the\nJournal of Differential Equations\nin\n1972\n. After the award of his doctorate, Lusztig was appointed as a Research Fellow at Warwick University in England. After spending the academic year\n1971\n-\n72\nas a Research Fellow he was appointed as a Lecturer in Mathematics and, two years later in\n1974\nas Professor of Mathematics at Warwick University. Roger Carter writes\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nLusztig's exceptional mathematical ability became evident at an early stage of his career at Warwick. He gave a remarkable\n30\nlecture M.Sc. course on the modular representation theory of the general linear group in which, during the second half, he was working out the theory while giving the course. There were a few occasions when he was apologetic that the lecture lasted only\n40\nrather than\n50\nminutes because he had not made sufficient progress since the previous lecture! His early experience as a mathematician was not without certain difficulties. There was a period during which, for financial reasons, he preferred to live in a tent outside the Mathematics Research Centre houses at Warwick University rather than in the houses themselves. He also experienced problems with the passport authorities in a number of countries so that, for a brief period, he had no entitlement to live in any country. However these difficulties did not prevent him from developing rapidly as a mathematician.\nIn his response to receiving the Steele Prize in\n2008\n, Lusztig spoke of the change in his research interests around the time he took up his Research Fellowship at Warwick\n[\n20\n]\n:-\nAround the time of my Ph.D., I switched from being a topologist with a strong interest in\nLie\ntheory to being a representation theorist with a strong interest in topology.\n(\nThe switch happened with some coaching by\nMichael Atiyah\nand later by Roger Carter.\n)\nAfter that most of my research was concerned with the study of representations of\nChevalley\ngroups over a finite field or used the experience I gained from groups over a finite field to explore neighbouring areas such as p-adic groups\n(\nwhich can be viewed as groups over a finite field that are infinite dimensional\n)\nor quantum groups\n(\nwhich can be viewed as analogues of the Iwahori-\nHecke\nalgebras, familiar from the finite group case\n)\n.\nIn\n1972\nhe married Michal-Nina Abraham; they had two daughters. One of these was Irene Lusztig who was born in England in\n1974\nbut brought up in the United States after her parents moved there. She studied at Harvard University and was awarded a BA in filmmaking and Chinese Studies. She became a filmmaker and her first film was\nReconstruction\n(2001)\n. This film relates the story of her Romanian-Jewish maternal grandmother Monica Sevianu, who was sentenced to life in prison for taking part in the Ioanid Gang bank heist in\n1959\n.\nGeorge Lusztig's marriage ended in\n2000\nand he married Gongqin Li in\n2003\n. The year\n1974\nwas an important one for Lusztig from a mathematical perspective. In that year his major paper\nOn the modular representations of the general linear and symmetric groups\nwritten jointly with Roger Carter was published. In the spring of that year he spent time in France at the Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques during which time he worked with\nPierre Deligne\n. He reported on this work in the lecture\nOn the discrete series representations of the classical groups over a finite field\nwhich he gave to the Algebraic Groups section at the International Congress of Mathematicians held in Vancouver in August\n1974\n. He had originally been invited to address the Algebraic Topology section but had requested the change to the Algebraic Groups section. While at the Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques in the spring of\n1974\nhe wrote the paper\nDivisibility of projective modules of finite Chevalley groups by the Steinberg module\n(1976)\nand returned to IHES for further visits in December\n1974\nand December\n1975\n. Out of these visits came the paper\nOn the finiteness of the number of unipotent classes\n(1976)\nand his joint paper with\nPierre Deligne\nRepresentations of reductive groups over finite fields\n. Also in\n1976\nhe published another major work with Roger Carter, continuing the work they had begun in the\n1974\npaper mentioned above, namely\nModular representations of finite groups of Lie type\n.\nIn the first half of\n1978\nI\n[\nEFR\n]\nspent five months at the Warwick Symposium on Infinite Groups and Group Rings at Warwick University. I was there with my family and we rented a house in Kenilworth owned by George Lusztig who, at that time, was visiting the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. While we were there Lusztig made the decision to accept the offer of a professorship at MIT and I was asked to show prospective buyers round his Kenilworth house. Lusztig has remained as a professor at MIT being\nNorbert Wiener\nProfessor from\n1999\nto\n2009\nand is now Abdun Nur Professor.\nAn excellent overview to Lusztig's contributions is given in the citation for the award of the\nAmerican Mathematical Society\n's Leroy P Steele Prize for Lifetime Achievement\n(2008)\n.\nSee\nTHIS LINK\n.\nLet us look briefly at the books that Lusztig has published. In\n1974\nhe published the monograph\nThe discrete series of\nG\nL\nn\nGL_{n}\nG\nL\nn\n​\nover a finite field\n. As the title indicates this deals with the general linear group but it raises the problem of treating other classical groups. In fact by the time the monograph was published, Lusztig had solved these too and described them in the invited lecture he gave at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Vancouver in\n1974\n(\nmentioned above\n)\n. The lectures he gave on\nRepresentations of finite Chevalley groups\nat the CBMS Regional Conference held at Madison, Wisconsin in August\n1974\nwere published by the\nAmerican Mathematical Society\nin the following year. In\n1984\nhe published\nCharacters of reductive groups over a finite field\n.\nBhama Srinivasan\nwrites in a review\n[\n28\n]\n:-\nThis book is a major piece of work in the theory of representations of finite groups of\nLie\ntype. ... Considering the complexity of the subject matter, this book has been written carefully and with regard to details. However, by its very nature, since it draws from various deep and rich theories such as algebraic geometry, intersection cohomology and enveloping algebras, it requires a great deal of effort and commitment on the part of the reader. The reader who perseveres with the book will be richly rewarded at seeing the unexpected connections of these branches of mathematics with the representation theory of finite groups, which had hitherto been regarded as a somewhat isolated field.\nHis next major book was\nIntroduction to quantum groups\n(1993)\n. Jie Du writes\n[\n5\n]\n:-\nThe book under review summarises and updates the author's main contributions to quantum group theory over the last\n5\nor\n6\nyears. Quantum groups came up originally in physics, but soon became a new and very rapidly developing field in mathematics. Extensive connections have already been found between quantum groups and various mathematical areas such as\nLie\ntheory, low-dimensional topology, group theory, noncommutative geometry and so on. ... the book presents many topics, together with detailed arguments for most of them, in quantum group theory. It is written to a very high standard and perhaps is an introductory book for experienced researchers and experts.\nIn\n2003\nLusztig published\nHecke algebras with unequal parameters\n. Götz Pfeiffer writes in a review\n[\n23\n]\n:-\nAn introduction to\nCoxeter\ngroups and their associated Iwahori-\nHecke\nalgebras need not be long to be comprehensive. In this book the theory is developed from scratch, in a purely combinatorial setup, through a sequence of\n13\nshort chapters over\n58\npages, complete with proofs and examples, from basic properties of\nCoxeter\ngroups to Kazhdan-Lusztig cells and the definition of the so-called a-function. ... This book leads its reader through a carefully chosen sequence of short pieces, which are more or less easy to digest, from the definitions of the basic concepts right into the middle of an important part of the theory of algebraic groups and their representations. It summarises much of the current knowledge and adds many new results. It sets the stage for a field of research where many questions are waiting to be answered, in the form of general theorems as well as by concrete calculations for specific cases; the book contains examples of both. The second half of the book is a major research article which assumes some acquaintance with the representation theory of finite or p-adic groups. In its first half the book presents an accessible self-contained introduction to the theory of cells and Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials.\nLusztig has received major honours for his outstanding contributions. In addition to the invitation to address the International Congress of Mathematicians in Vancouver in\n1974\n, he was invited to give a plenary address at the International Congress of Mathematicians held in Kyoto, August\n1990\n. He gave the address\nIntersection cohomology methods in representation theory\nand the\nAmerican Mathematical Society\nproduced a video of his lecture.\nBhama Srinivasan\nwrites\n[\n29\n]\n:-\nThe speaker covers a lot of ground in this one-hour talk. He manages to convey the flavour of the deep results that he describes, by giving concrete examples. In many cases he describes the results for special linear or general linear groups in concrete geometric terms. The viewer will benefit from reading the speaker's published paper cited above, which gives more details than the talk as well as references to the cited results. The videotape and the paper complement each other, and give a fine exposition of some of the important developments in representation theory that have occurred in the last decade.\nThe prizes he had been awarded include the\nLondon Mathematical Society\n's Berwick Prize\n(1977)\n, the\nAmerican Mathematical Society\n's\nCole\nPrize in Algebra\n(1985)\n, the\nDutch Mathematical Society\n's\nBrouwer\nMedal\n(1999)\n, the\nRomanian Academy\n's Diploma of Academic Merit\n(2007)\n, and the\nAmerican Mathematical Society\n's Leroy P Steele Prize for Lifetime Achievement\n(2008)\n. The citation begins\n[\n20\n]\n:-\nThe work of George Lusztig has entirely reshaped representation theory and in the process changed much of mathematics.\nThe full citation is at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nHe was elected a fellow of the\nRoyal Society\n(1983)\n, a member of the\nAmerican Academy of Arts and Sciences\n(1991)\n, and a member of the\nNational Academy of Sciences\n(1992)\n. He became an honorary professor of the University of Cordoba\n(1989)\n, was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Paris VII\n(1997)\n, was awarded the Romanian National Order \"Faithful Service\" in the rank of commander\n(2003)\n, was made an honorary member of the Mathematics Institute of the\nRomanian Academy\n(2005)\n, and was awarded a Simons Fellowship in Mathematics in\n2014\nand again in\n2021\n.\nHis two most recent awards have been the highly prestigious Shaw Prize in Mathematical Sciences in\n2014\nand the equally prestigious Wolf Prize for Mathematics in\n2022\n. He was awarded the Shaw Prize in Mathematical Sciences\n[\n4\n]\n:-\n... for his fundamental contributions to algebra, algebraic geometry, and representation theory, and for weaving these subjects together to solve old problems and reveal beautiful new connections.\nFor more information about the award of the Shaw Prize in Mathematical Sciences for\n2014\nto George Lusztig, see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nHe was awarded the Wolf Prize in Mathematics\n2022\n[\n12\n]\n:-\n... for ground-breaking contributions to representation theory and related areas.\nor more information about the award of the Wolf Prize in Mathematics\n2022\nto George Lusztig, see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nWhen asked in the interview\n[\n22\n]\nwhat should be done to make mathematics more attractive, he gave the following reply:-\nWhen I was in Romania, I had a very good status because I went to the Mathematical Olympiad. Conversely, in America, at the school where my daughters went, children who were good at mathematics were often looked down on. I think that the salaries of mathematics teachers should be substantially increased, so that this profession attracts the best. School competitions are also very useful: they made me realise that I am good at mathematics and that this is what I have to do, they gave me confidence. I think it would be better if the schools emphasised the beautiful, interesting part of mathematics more than the \"useful\" part, which is mostly boring.\nWe should note Lusztig's interest in yoga. He said\n[\n22\n]\n:-\nI am interested in yoga. I began to practise in\n1994\nto relax\n(\nin the previous year I had been working too hard - with serious consequences for my health\n)\n. I did very well and I decided to study yoga seriously. In the summer of\n1995\nI took a course from which I received a yoga instructor license. For me, yoga is not related to mathematics, rather it is complementary to it. But I don't practice in any group, more alone. I adopted a certain way of life, I became a vegetarian.\nWe end this biography by quoting Roger Carter\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nLusztig's work is characterised by a very high degree of originality, an enormous breadth of subject matter, remarkable technical virtuosity, and great profundity in getting to the heart of the problems involved. It can be no exaggeration to say that George Lusztig is one of the great mathematicians of our time.",
