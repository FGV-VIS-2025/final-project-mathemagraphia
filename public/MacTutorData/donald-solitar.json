  "biografia": "Donald Solitar\n's parents were Moishe and Lizzie Solitar. He gave the following dedication to his parents in a book of poetry he wrote in the\n1980\ns:-\nTo my father Moishe\nAnd my mother Lizzie\nWho shared with me\nTheir kindness and\nconcern for all people\nAnd their wit and good\nhumour to warm\npeople' hearts.\nDonald showed considerable mathematical talents when still in primary school. He attended the Boys' High School in Brooklyn, New York, where he became a member of the Mathematics Team which competed in mathematical competitions with other schools in Brooklyn. The captain of the Team was Abraham Karrass, known to all as Abe, and he gave Donald special coaching in solving problems. Abe Karrass, who was one year older than Donald Solitar, remained a close friend throughout his life.\nSolitar entered Brooklyn College, the first coeducational liberal arts college in New York founded in\n1930\n. Today Brooklyn College is part of City University of New York but at the time Solitar studied mathematics there it was an independent institution. Abe Karrass was at New York University and their friendship continued with Karrass essentially acting as a tutor to Solitar. He graduated in June\n1953\nwith a Bachelor's degree and then went to Princeton where he hoped to study for a Ph.D. in group theory with\nEmil Artin\nas his advisor. This did not work out as he had hoped since\nArtin\nwas working in class field theory and Solitar was very certain of the area in which he wanted to undertake research. He therefore only remained at Princeton for one year during which time he was awarded a Master's degree, then moved to New York University to study for his doctorate under\nWilhelm Magnus\n.\nThe move to New York University in\n1954\nwas again a consequence of his friendship with Abe Karrass. Abe had visited Donald while he had been studying at Princeton and the two had begun undertaking research into group theory which Karrass was studying with\nMagnus\n. Their collaboration continued with renewed vigour when they were together at New York University and in\n1956\nthey published a joint paper\nSome remarks on the infinite symmetric groups\n. This paper was the first for both the young mathematicians and gave a number of facts about infinite symmetric groups such as normalisers of elements and orders of composition factors. In\n1957\nthey published\nNote on a theorem of Schreier\nthen in the following year the two papers\nOn free products\nand\nSubgroup theorems in the theory of groups given by defining relations\n. This last paper studied how to find presentations for a subgroup of finite index in a group given by generators and relations. It contained results which had formed part of Solitar's doctoral thesis\nOn Subgroup Theorems\nwritten under\nMagnus\n's supervision. He was awarded his Ph.D. in January\n1958\n.\nAfter the award of his doctorate, Solitar was appointed to the Mathematics Department of Adelphi College in New York. At this time Adelphi College did not have university status but this was granted in\n1963\n. Solitar was on the faculty at Adelphi University until\n1968\n, as was his friend and collaborator Abe Karrass. In fact Karrass had registered for a Ph.D. at Adelphi under Donald Solitar's supervision and became the first student to receive a Ph.D. in Mathematics from Adelphi when he was awarded the degree in\n1961\nfor his thesis\nNon-Desarguian Planes and Parallel Geometries\n. At Adelphi, Solitar and Karras founded the highly successful National Science Foundation Summer Institute for High School Teachers, a program designed for teachers who wished to deepen their knowledge of mathematics and to see it put in an historical context. Also during this time the classic text\nCombinatorial group theory: Presentations of groups in terms of generators and relations\nby\nWilhelm Magnus\n, Abe Karrass, and Donald Solitar, was published.\nThe Preface of\nCombinatorial group theory\nis at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nGraham Higman\nwrote in a review:-\nThis book is an excellent and detailed account, with many examples, of some aspects of group theory closely connected with generators and relations. The approach throughout is very concrete. ... this book covers a section of group theory not adequately treated elsewhere in the literature. The treatment is very thorough, almost everything being written out in explicit detail. If this makes for a heavy book, materially, for a comparatively small corner of mathematics, it must be said also that it makes the book a delight to read, and easy to find one's way around. ... for anyone with any interest in infinite groups, it will be indispensable.\nPaul Cohn\nwrote in a review:-\nOne of the subtleties which the beginning student of group theory has to master is this: When a group is given by generators and defining relations, there is no obvious way of telling when different expressions represent the same element\n(\neven the elements represented by different generators need not be distinct\n)\n. This is essentially the word problem and from the work of\nNovikov\n,\nBoone\nand\nBritton\nwe know that groups with unsolvable word problem exist. But from the point of view of the working group theorist, and even more, of the general mathematician using groups, it is more important to have good knowledge of methods of solving the word problem. The book under review is devoted to a study of such methods. ... Throughout the book the emphasis is on techniques, rather than general results and this outlook is supported by the very substantial collection of exercises, many of interest in their own right. The tone is elementary throughout; the authors are at pains to make themselves understood ... the reader will acquire a valuable tool for handing groups, and a most useful collection of specimens.\nIn\n1968\nSolitar was appointed as a professor and Chair of the Mathematics Department of York University in Toronto, Canada. He was also Acting Chair of the Computer Science Department at York from\n1968\nto\n1973\n. His friend Abe Karrass moved to the mathematics department of York University at the same time and the two continued their collaboration. At York they started the successful MA Mathematics Program for High School Teachers. In the winter of\n1976\nin Toronto, Solitar met J Francien Hageman who was born in Amsterdam; they married soon after meeting.\nIn\n1981\nI\n[\nEFR\n]\nmet Donald for the first time when he attended Groups St Andrews\n1981\nheld at the University of St Andrews in Scotland. He attended the conference with his wife Francien and his wife's parents. I will always remember his kindness in organising gifts to my wife and the wife of my co-organiser Colin Campbell at the end of the conference to thank them for their work during the conference. We have exchanged Christmas greetings ever since then and ever year we bring out a little \"NOEL\" train as part of our Christmas decoration which Donald gave us. Let me also record his kindness to myself and my colleague Colin Campbell when we visited North America.\nIn\n1982\nSolitar was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada, Mathematics Academy III. Donald was an inspiring teacher, and in\n1985\nreceived an Ontario Confederation of University Faculty Associations Teaching Award. Bob Burns, Israel Kleiner, and Alfred Pietrowski write:-\nProfessor Solitar was a 'lateral thinker', very often coming up with an unexpected viewpoint. He was well known in the international mathematical community ... He had an ebullient and in other ways extraordinary personality, and was extremely generous to all he came in contact with.\nFrancien Solitar writes\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nDonald suffered a massive heart attack and left us a very short time thereafter. His last hours were filled with writing a poem in honour of the birthday of his lifelong friend Abe Karrass, who passed away exactly ten years ahead of Donald. We were actually celebrating Abe's birthday together with Abe's wife Lina, when Donald fell ill and passed. Donald's body has been cremated and his ashes will be interred on June\n15\n,\n2008\n. Donald is greatly missed by his family and by his many friends.\nAs indicated by this quote, Donald loved to write poetry. He sent a Christmas gift of a booklet of his poems in\n1985\n. He wrote on the title page:-\n15\nDecember\n1985\nHere's to St Andrew and all that's Scottish\n(\nthough some in England find them plottish\n)\n.\nDonald\nHere is a poem from the collection:\nA FAT AND KIND PROFESSOR\nA fat and kind professor once\nThere dwelled in ivy tower.\nHe'd sit and earn his research funds\nFor hour after hour.\nOh yes he taught And sometimes fought\nThe Philistines in power.\nHe'd lecture times\nOn all Ed's crimes\nAnd let love fall in shower.\nBut all in all\nFrom tower tall\nHe rarely made descendence.\nHe'd speak a while\nPat heads and smile,\nEnjoy his independence.\nBut one day rare\nThere pierced the air\nA terrible outwailing.\nFrom children small\nAnd parents tall\nAll times and without failing.\nNow this fierce din\nDisturbed' him\nA-sitting in his skyroom.\nSo he came down\nIn North York town\nTo ask exactly why room\nCould not be found\nTo gather round\nAnd comfort each dear victim.\nAnd that is why\nNew trade he'll ply.\nThe children they have picked him.\nTo this fair land\nWhich treats him grand\nHe intends to give assistance\nTo make kids proud\nOf it and crowd\nOut bad with their persistence.",
