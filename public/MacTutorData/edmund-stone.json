  "biografia": "Edmund Stone\nwas born sometime around\n1700\n, the son of a gardener of the Duke of Argyll. He first learned to read at the age of eight and was completely self-taught. He mastered both French and Latin in order to read mathematical works. At the age of eighteen, Stone came to the attention of the duke when the latter found Stone's copy of\nNewton\n's\nPrincipia\nin his grounds and assumed that it had been removed from his library. Impressed by the young man, the duke \"placed him in a position which afforded him opportunity to pursue his studies\".\nStone translated works of the\nMarquis de l'H么pital\non conic sections\n(1720)\nand Bion on scientific instruments\n(1723)\n. In\n1725\n, he was admitted as a fellow of the\nRoyal Society\nin\n1725\nand published\nA New Mathematical Dictionary\n. In\n1730\n, he published\nThe Method of Fluxions, both Direct and Inverse\n: the first part is a translation and reworking in Newtonian notation of\nDe l'H么pital\n's\nAnalyse des infinement petits\n(\nin fact, written by\nJohann Bernoulli\n)\n, and the second part is Stone's own.\nIn\n1736\n, he independently found two species of lines of the third order which had been overlooked by\nNewton\nand\nStirling\n, but these had been discovered by others a few years earlier. He also published some other mathematical works.\nFollowing the death of the Duke of Argyll in\n1743\n, Stone's situation deteriorated and he spent the latter part of his life in poverty.",
