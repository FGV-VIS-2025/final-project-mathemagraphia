  "biografia": "Madhava of Sangamagrama\nwas born near Cochin on the coast in the Kerala state in southwestern India. It is only due to research into Keralese mathematics over the last twenty-five years that the remarkable contributions of Madhava have come to light. In\n[\n10\n]\nRajagopal and Rangachari put his achievement into context when they write:-\n[\nMadhava\n]\ntook the decisive step onwards from the finite procedures of ancient mathematics to treat their limit-passage to infinity, which is the kernel of modern classical analysis.\nAll the mathematical writings of Madhava have been lost, although some of his texts on astronomy have survived. However his brilliant work in mathematics has been largely discovered by the reports of other Keralese mathematicians such as\nNilakantha\nwho lived about\n100\nyears later.\nMadhava discovered the series equivalent to the\nMaclaurin\nexpansions of sin\nx\nx\nx\n, cos\nx\nx\nx\n, and\narctan\n⁡\nx\n\\arctan x\narctan\nx\naround\n1400\n, which is over two hundred years before they were rediscovered in Europe. Details appear in a number of works written by his followers such as\nMahajyanayana prakara\nwhich means\nMethod of computing the great sines\n. In fact this work had been claimed by some historians such as Sarma\n(\nsee for example\n[\n2\n]\n)\nto be by Madhava himself but this seems highly unlikely and it is now accepted by most historians to be a\n16\nth\ncentury work by a follower of Madhava. This is discussed in detail in\n[\n4\n]\n.\nJyesthadeva\nwrote\nYukti-Bhasa\nin Malayalam, the regional language of Kerala, around\n1550\n. In\n[\n9\n]\nGupta gives a translation of the text and this is also given in\n[\n2\n]\nand a number of other sources.\nJyesthadeva\ndescribes Madhava's series as follows:-\nThe first term is the product of the given sine and radius of the desired arc divided by the cosine of the arc. The succeeding terms are obtained by a process of iteration when the first term is repeatedly multiplied by the square of the sine and divided by the square of the cosine. All the terms are then divided by the odd numbers\n1\n,\n3\n,\n5\n, .... The arc is obtained by adding and subtracting respectively the terms of odd rank and those of even rank. It is laid down that the sine of the arc or that of its complement whichever is the smaller should be taken here as the given sine. Otherwise the terms obtained by this above iteration will not tend to the vanishing magnitude.\nThis is a remarkable passage describing Madhava's series, but remember that even this passage by\nJyesthadeva\nwas written more than\n100\nyears before\nJames Gregory\nrediscovered this series expansion. Perhaps we should write down in modern symbols exactly what the series is that Madhava has found. The first thing to note is that the Indian meaning for sine of θ would be written in our notation as\nr\nsin\n⁡\nθ\nr \\sin \\theta\nr\nsin\nθ\nand the Indian cosine of would be\nr\ncos\n⁡\nθ\nr \\cos \\theta\nr\ncos\nθ\nin our notation, where\nr\nr\nr\nis the radius. Thus the series is\nr\nθ\n=\nr\nr\nsin\n⁡\nθ\nr\ncos\n⁡\nθ\n−\nr\nr\nsin\n⁡\nθ\n)\n3\n3\nr\n(\nr\ncos\n⁡\nθ\n)\n3\n+\nr\nr\nsin\n⁡\nθ\n)\n5\n5\nr\n(\nr\ncos\n⁡\nθ\n)\n5\n−\nr\nr\nsin\n⁡\nθ\n)\n7\n7\nr\n(\nr\ncos\n⁡\nθ\n)\n7\n+\n.\n.\n.\nr \\theta = r\\Large\\frac{r \\sin \\theta}{r \\cos \\theta}\\normalsize - r\\Large\\frac{r \\sin \\theta)^{3}}{3r(r \\cos \\theta)^{3}}\\normalsize + r\\Large\\frac{r \\sin \\theta)^{5}}{5r(r \\cos \\theta)^{5}}\\normalsize- r\\Large\\frac{r \\sin \\theta)^{7}}{7r(r \\cos \\theta)^{7}}\\normalsize + ...\nr\nθ\n=\nr\nr\nc\no\ns\nθ\nr\ns\ni\nn\nθ\n​\n−\nr\n3\nr\n(\nr\nc\no\ns\nθ\n)\n3\nr\ns\ni\nn\nθ\n)\n3\n​\n+\nr\n5\nr\n(\nr\nc\no\ns\nθ\n)\n5\nr\ns\ni\nn\nθ\n)\n5\n​\n−\nr\n7\nr\n(\nr\nc\no\ns\nθ\n)\n7\nr\ns\ni\nn\nθ\n)\n7\n​\n+\n.\n.\n.\nputting\ntan\n⁡\n=\nsin\n⁡\ncos\n⁡\n\\tan = \\Large \\frac {\\sin}{\\cos}\ntan\n=\nc\no\ns\ns\ni\nn\n​\nand cancelling\nr\nr\nr\ngives\nθ\n=\ntan\n⁡\nθ\n−\n1\n3\ntan\n⁡\n3\nθ\n+\n1\n5\ntan\n⁡\n5\nθ\n−\n.\n.\n.\n\\theta = \\tan \\theta - \\large\\frac{1}{3}\\normalsize \\tan^{3}\\theta + \\large\\frac{1}{5}\\normalsize \\tan^{5}\\theta - ...\nθ\n=\ntan\nθ\n−\n3\n1\n​\ntan\n3\nθ\n+\n5\n1\n​\ntan\n5\nθ\n−\n.\n.\n.\nwhich is equivalent to\nGregory\n's series\ntan\n⁡\n−\n1\nθ\n=\nθ\n−\n1\n3\nθ\n3\n+\n1\n5\nθ\n5\n−\n.\n.\n.\n\\tan^{-1}\\theta = \\theta - \\large\\frac{1}{3}\\normalsize \\theta^{3} + \\large\\frac{1}{5}\\normalsize \\theta^{5} - ...\ntan\n−\n1\nθ\n=\nθ\n−\n3\n1\n​\nθ\n3\n+\n5\n1\n​\nθ\n5\n−\n.\n.\n.\nNow Madhava put\nq\n=\nπ\n4\nq = \\large\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\normalsize\nq\n=\n4\nπ\n​\ninto his series to obtain\nπ\n4\n=\n1\n−\n1\n3\n+\n1\n5\n−\n.\n.\n.\n\\Large\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\normalsize  = 1 -  \\large\\frac{1}{3}\\normalsize  + \\large\\frac{1}{5}\\normalsize  - ...\n4\nπ\n​\n=\n1\n−\n3\n1\n​\n+\n5\n1\n​\n−\n.\n.\n.\nand he also put\nθ\n=\nπ\n6\n\\theta = \\Large\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\normalsize\nθ\n=\n6\nπ\n​\ninto his series to obtain\nπ\n=\n12\n(\n1\n−\n1\n3\n×\n3\n+\n1\n5\n×\n3\n2\n−\n1\n7\n×\n3\n3\n+\n.\n.\n.\n)\n\\pi = \\sqrt{12}(1 - \\large\\frac{1}{3\\times 3}\\normalsize  + \\large\\frac{1}{5\\times 3^{2}}\\normalsize  - \\large\\frac{1}{7\\times 3^{3}}\\normalsize  + ...)\nπ\n=\n1\n2\n​\n(\n1\n−\n3\n×\n3\n1\n​\n+\n5\n×\n3\n2\n1\n​\n−\n7\n×\n3\n3\n1\n​\n+\n.\n.\n.\n)\nWe know that Madhava obtained an approximation for π correct to\n11\ndecimal places when he gave\nπ\n=\n3.14159265359\n\\pi = 3.14159265359\nπ\n=\n3\n.\n1\n4\n1\n5\n9\n2\n6\n5\n3\n5\n9\nwhich can be obtained from the last of Madhava's series above by taking\n21\nterms. In\n[\n5\n]\nGupta gives a translation of the Sanskrit text giving Madhava's approximation of π correct to\n11\nplaces.\nPerhaps even more impressive is the fact that Madhava gave a remainder term for his series which improved the approximation. He improved the approximation of the series for\nπ\n4\n\\large\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\normalsize\n4\nπ\n​\nby adding a correction term\nR\nn\nR_{n}\nR\nn\n​\nto obtain\nπ\n4\n=\n1\n−\n1\n3\n+\n1\n5\n−\n.\n.\n.\n1\n2\nn\n−\n1\n±\nR\nn\n\\Large\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\normalsize  = 1 - \\large\\frac{1}{3}\\normalsize  + \\large\\frac{1}{5}\\normalsize  - ... \\large\\frac{1}{2n-1}\\normalsize  ± R_{n}\n4\nπ\n​\n=\n1\n−\n3\n1\n​\n+\n5\n1\n​\n−\n.\n.\n.\n2\nn\n−\n1\n1\n​\n±\nR\nn\n​\nMadhava gave three forms of\nR\nn\nR_{n}\nR\nn\n​\nwhich improved the approximation, namely\nR\nn\n=\n1\n4\nn\nR_{n} = \\Large\\frac{1}{4n}\nR\nn\n​\n=\n4\nn\n1\n​\nor\nR\nn\n=\nn\n4\nn\n2\n+\n1\nR_{n} =  \\Large\\frac{n}{4n^{2} + 1}\nR\nn\n​\n=\n4\nn\n2\n+\n1\nn\n​\nor\nR\nn\n=\nn\n2\n+\n1\n4\nn\n3\n+\n5\nn\nR_{n} =  \\Large\\frac{n^{2} + 1}{4n^{3} + 5n}\nR\nn\n​\n=\n4\nn\n3\n+\n5\nn\nn\n2\n+\n1\n​\n.\nThere has been a lot of work done in trying to reconstruct how Madhava might have found his correction terms. The most convincing is that they come as the first three convergents of a continued fraction which can itself be derived from the standard Indian approximation to π namely\n62832\n20000\n\\large\\frac{62832}{20000}\\normalsize\n2\n0\n0\n0\n0\n6\n2\n8\n3\n2\n​\n.\nMadhava also gave a table of almost accurate values of half-sine chords for twenty-four arcs drawn at equal intervals in a quarter of a given circle. It is thought that the way that he found these highly accurate tables was to use the equivalent of the series expansions\nsin\n⁡\nθ\n=\nθ\n−\n1\n3\n!\nθ\n3\n+\n1\n5\n!\nθ\n5\n−\n.\n.\n.\n\\sin \\theta = \\theta - \\large\\frac{1}{3!}\\normalsize \\theta^{3} + \\large\\frac{1}{5!}\\normalsize \\theta^{5}  - ...\nsin\nθ\n=\nθ\n−\n3\n!\n1\n​\nθ\n3\n+\n5\n!\n1\n​\nθ\n5\n−\n.\n.\n.\ncos\n⁡\nθ\n=\n1\n−\n1\n2\n!\nθ\n2\n+\n1\n4\n!\nθ\n4\n−\n.\n.\n.\n\\cos \\theta = 1 - \\large\\frac{1}{2!}\\normalsize \\theta^{2}  + \\large\\frac{1}{4!}\\normalsize \\theta^{4}  - ...\ncos\nθ\n=\n1\n−\n2\n!\n1\n​\nθ\n2\n+\n4\n!\n1\n​\nθ\n4\n−\n.\n.\n.\nJyesthadeva\nin\nYukti-Bhasa\ngave an explanation of how Madhava found his series expansions around\n1400\nwhich are equivalent to these modern versions rediscovered by\nNewton\naround\n1676\n. Historians have claimed that the method used by Madhava amounts to term by term integration.\nRajagopal's claim that Madhava took the decisive step towards modern classical analysis seems very fair given his remarkable achievements. In the same vein Joseph writes in\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nWe may consider Madhava to have been the founder of mathematical analysis. Some of his discoveries in this field show him to have possessed extraordinary intuition, making him almost the equal of the more recent intuitive genius\nSrinivasa Ramanujan\n, who spent his childhood and youth at Kumbakonam, not far from Madhava's birthplace.",
