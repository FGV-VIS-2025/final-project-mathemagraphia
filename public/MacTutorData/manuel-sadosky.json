  "biografia": "Although\nManuel Sadosky\nwas born in Buenos Aires, Argentina, his parents, Natalio Sadosky and Maria Steingart, were Jewish Russian immigrants who had fled Russia because of continued violence against Jews. Manuel Sadosky spoke about his parents in an interview\n[\n15\n]\n:-\nI don't think I'm the most appropriate to talk about immigration. I never felt like an immigrant, nor did my siblings. My parents arrived in Argentina in\n1905\n. They came from Russia, from a village called Ekatherineslav, in Ukraine. The country was then as Tolstoy paints it. Jews were not allowed to study; they could only work in handicrafts. My father Note, Natalio Sadosky, was a shoemaker, but both he and my mother felt left behind and exposed to pogroms that could break out at any moment.\nNatalio Sadosky had arrived in Argentina in\n1905\nwith his wife, who was illiterate. We should make it clear that the fact that Maria had never learnt to read and write was not due to any lack of ability, simply a comment about the state of education in her native country at that time. Natalio and Maria Sadosky arrived in Argentina with their three children but two of these later died. In Argentina they had six more children so only one of their seven surviving children, four boys and three girls, had been born abroad.\nJulio Argentino Roca, president of Argentina, had appointed Domingo Faustino Sarmiento to set up public primary schools in Buenos Aires. Sarmiento believed that education can change societies and he promoted the most democratic educational system of his time.  It was in this system that Manuel received his primary education. He spent the two years\n1920\nand\n1921\nat the primary school now named Escuela No.\n13\nD. E.\n06\nBrigadier General José María Zapiola and then five years at the Escuela Normal Superior No.\n2\nde Lenguas Vivas Mariano Acosta. He said:-\nI was privileged having gone to primary school before\n1930\n, to the Sarmiento school, to have had a teacher like the one I had in sixth grade, which prompted us to meet heroes like Ameghino.\nWe note that Florentino Ameghino\n(1853\n-\n1911)\nwas a famous Argentine naturalist and paleontologist, and that the teacher he had in the sixth grade was Alberto Fesquet who taught him to think about science rather than memorising facts. Sadosky later recalled\n[\n16\n]\n:-\nAt Acosta there were a large number of excellent teachers. That school had a way of choosing its teachers that always seemed good to me: the best graduates on the teaching staff\n(\nin science and arts\n)\ngradually joined the university profession. Fesquet, for example, was a great teacher.\nSadosky graduated from the Mariano Acosta in\n1931\nwith a qualification to be a school teacher. This qualification was not sufficient to allow him to even sit the entrance examinations for the University of Buenos Aires so Sadosky studied to take the equivalent for his bachelor's degree at the Colegio Nacional de Adrogué. This qualified him to take the entrance examination for an engineering degree at the University of Buenos Aires, which he successfully passed. In\n1932\nhe began his studies in the Faculty of Exact, Physics and Natural Sciences of the University of Buenos Aires.\nWhen Sadosky began his studies at the University of Buenos Aires his intention was to study for an engineering degree. In his first year he took mathematics courses as well as engineering courses and he said that after taking the course\nConstruction of buildings\nhe became convinced that engineering was not for him while he had loved the mathematics courses he had taken. He changed to taking a mathematics degree which did not require him to change faculties since mathematics was also part of the Faculty of Exact, Physics and Natural Sciences. There was a\n[\n31\n]\n:-\n... little classroom in the old building at Calle Perú, for more than a century home to the School of Sciences - which was not much more than an engineering college. The \"irregular\" courses of what was pompously called the Doctoral Programme in Mathematics and Physics took place in a little classroom at the side of the stairs.\nThe mathematics staff in the University of Buenos Aires when Sadosky was a student consisted of\nJulio Rey Pastor\n, the only paid professor, and Juan Carlos Vignaux, who held an honorary position. Sadosky writes\n[\n31\n]\n:-\nNeedless to say,\nRey Pastor\nand Vignaux were mortal enemies, and we, the students, had a hard time, since the examination panels were required by law to consist of three professors!\nThere were, however, a number of outstanding students of mathematics at that time.\nCora Ratto\nwas in the same class as Sadosky and Yanny Frenkel was also a student. In\n1935\nMischa Cotlar\njoined them when he began studying mathematics at the University of Buenos Aires. During his time as an undergraduate, Sadosky was appointed for the three years\n1933\n-\n35\nas an honorary assistant in Analytic and Projective Geometry. In September\n1937\nhe was awarded a bachelor's degree in physical and mathematical sciences with honours. Also in\n1937\nManuel Sadosky married\nCora Ratto\nwho also graduated in Physical-Mathematical Sciences in September\n1937\n. Their daughter\nCora Sadosky\nwrote in\n[\n30\n]\n:-\nIn\n1937\nCora Ratto\nmarried Manuel Sadosky, her lifelong companion both in mathematics and in political activities. Manuel was a bookish and intense young man from a poor Jewish family whose parents had fled the pogroms in tsarist Russia in\n1905\n. ...\nCora\nand Manuel shared a long and happy marriage. Their house was always full of friends, attracted by a hostess who was not only a superb cook, but also a great conversationalist, mixing witticism with wisdom and genuine caring.\nCora\nand Manuel had one daughter\n[\nCora Sadosky\n]\n- who also became a mathematician - and one granddaughter, who became the greatest joy of their lives. Both of them are called Cora!\nIt is worth noting at this point how high level mathematics was developing in Argentina during the years that Sadosky spent as an undergraduate at the University of Buenos Aires. In\n1933\nthe Argentine Association for the Progress of Science was created, modelled on the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Juan Carlos Vignaux, who taught Sadosky, was a founder member of the Argentine Association. In\n1936\nthe\nArgentina Mathematical Union\nwas founded, through the efforts of many but particularly\nJulio Rey Pastor\n, and in the same year began publishing the\nRevista de la Unión Matemática Argentina\nⓉ\n(\nJournal of the Argentine Mathematical Union\n)\n. Yanny Frenkel, who was at that time a Ph.D. student advised by\nJulio Rey Pastor\n, became one of the secretaries. She married\nMischa Cotlar\nin\n1938\n. Esteban Terradas, a Catholic who was labelled a conservative, was out of favour in Republican Barcelona at the start of the Spanish Civil War and he realised he had to leave Spain. He left at the end of October\n1936\n, going to Argentina where he became very active supporting mathematics. He gave courses on mathematics and engineering at the University of Barcelona and he became Sadosky's Ph.D. advisor when he began research in\n1937\n.\nAfter the award of his bachelor's degree, Sadosky had to decide either to find a job or to undertake research for his doctorate. In fact he cleverly managed to do both by taking a position of astronomer at the Astronomical Observatory of La Plata. The director of the Observatory was the newly arrived\nEsteban Terradas\nso Sadosky was able to work there and also undertake research for his Ph.D. at the University of Buenos Aires with\nTerradas\nas his thesis advisor. He defended his thesis\nSobre los métodos de resolución aproximada de ciertas ecuaciones de la fisicomatemática\nⓉ\n(\nOn the methods of approximate resolution of certain equations of mathematical-physics\n)\nin\n1940\nand awarded a doctorate with distinction. He writes in the thesis:-\nI am pleased to present four copies of my thesis to qualify for the title of Doctor of Physico-mathematical Sciences, complying with the provision of article\n353\nof the Digest of the Faculty. The thesis is entitled \"On the methods of approximate resolution of certain equations of physico-mathematics\", according to the topic approved in due time by the Thesis Committee. On this occasion, I must express my gratitude to doctors\nEsteban Terradas\nand\nJulio Rey Pastor\nfor the frequent and useful guiding suggestions and bibliographic indications that I have received from them during the performance of my work. Likewise, I consider it a duty to express my gratitude to all the professors from whom I have received teachings and advice during my degree and in the course of my studies, particularly doctors Teófilo Isnardi, Juan C Viguaux, Juan Blaquier and Agustin Durañons y Vedia.\nAlthough there were no computing facilities at the time, in his thesis Sadosky studied the method of finite differences, the procedures of Ritz and\nGalerkin\n, and the\nPoisson\nintegral, all topics which would become important in numerical analysis courses when computers become available. In\n1939\n, while still working on his thesis, he had begun teaching mathematics at the National University of La Plata.\nSadosky's daughter,\nCora Sadosky\n, was born in May\n1940\nwhen he was near to finishing his doctorate which he completed on\n30\nSeptember\n1940\n. Between\n1939\nand\n1946\nSadosky served as an Assistant in the Department of Mathematics in the Faculty of Physico-mathematical Sciences of the National University of La Plata and was in charge of the practical courses Higher Mathematics I and II\n(\ndifferential equations and analytical functions\n)\n. He also taught short courses on the Calculus of Variations and, during\n1944\n-\n46\n, a course on the Foundations of Mathematics for students in the Mathematics Faculty.\nThe award of a scholarship from the French government allowed Sadosky, together with his wife\nCora Ratto de Sadosky\nand his daughter\nCora Sadosky\n, to travel to Paris in October\n1946\nto undertake post-doctoral work. He worked at the\nHenri Poincaré\nInstitute, advised by\nGeorges Darmois\nand participated in the Seminar on the Calculus of Probability and Statistics led by\nMaurice Fréchet\n. Leaving Paris in January\n1948\n, Sadosky and his family went to Italy, where he worked in Rome under the direction of\nMauro Picone\n, at the Istituto per le Applicazioni del Calcolo, until\n1949\n, when Sadosky and his family returned to Argentina.\nJuan Perón had been elected president of Argentina in\n1946\nand in\n1949\nintroduced Constitutional Reforms. These were not supported by all and were opposed by the Radicals who declared the Peronists did not have the required majority to make constitutional changes. Universities lost their autonomy and opponents of the Constitutional Reforms pointed out that Perón had centralised too much power in his own hands\n[\n30\n]\n:-\nThe Sadoskys returned to Argentina during a period of turmoil and political repression. They were banned from teaching at public universities, as were all those not affiliated with the party in power, and\nCora\nwent to work at a commercial enterprise to support the family.\nSadosky managed to work at the Radiotechnical Institute of the University of Buenos Aires from\n1949\nto\n1952\n. He gave courses there on the Calculus of Probabilities and Numerical Integration of Differential Equations. Perón's government, however, became more determined that only supporters of the party could teach in universities and in\n1952\nSadosky was banned for political reasons from universities. In December\n1952\nhe published the book\nCálculo numérico y gráfico\nⓉ\n(\nNumerical and graphic calculation\n)\nwhich ran to nine editions, the last one in\n1981\n.\nAlston Householder\nwrites in the review\n[\n17\n]\n:-\nAn elementary text with chapter headings as follows: Numerical approximations, Scales, Logarithmic graphs, Slide rules, Nomography, Linear systems, Numerical solution of equations, Interpolation, Numerical differentiation and integration, Graphical and mechanical integration, Approximate integration of differential equations. Finally there is a twelve-page appendix entitled Evolution of mechanical and automatic calculation. In illustration of the level, Chapter VII gives the methods of regula falsi,\nNewton\n(\nwith a section on iterative processes in general\n)\n,\nHorner\n, and\nGräffe\n, with discussions of synthetic division,\nDescartes\n's rule of signs, and\nSturm\n's theorem. There are numerous examples, many worked out in detail.\nDuring\n1953\nand\n1954\nhe taught a mathematics course organised by the Engineering Student Centre. In\n1955\nPerón began to lose the support of the military and, after a failed coup in June\n1955\n, another in September\n1955\nsucceeded and Perón fled to exile in Spain. Although there was an unstable political situation over the following years, the universities regained their autonomy in\n1956\n. In the period before\n1956\nSadosky had been collaborating with\nRebeca Cherep de Guber\nwriting the book\nElementos de cálculo diferencial e integral\nⓉ\n(\nElements of differential and integral calculus\n)\nwhich was published in\n1956\n. This textbook was in two volumes, the first on the Differential Calculus and the second on the Integral Calculus. The book was not aimed primarily at mathematics students but rather it was written for engineers and users of mathematics.\nThe fall of Perón's government led to large changes in the universities. At the University of Buenos Aires, Sadosky was appointed Acting Professor of Mathematical Analysis in the Faculty of Exact and Natural Sciences and Acting Professor of Special Mathematics in the Faculty of Engineering. A competition was held for a full professorship in the Faculty of Engineering and Sadosky was appointed on\n9\nMay\n1957\n. On\n13\nJune\n1959\nhe was appointed as a full professor in the Faculty of Exact and Natural Sciences and, as a consequence, resigned his professorship in the Faculty of Engineering. On\n28\nDecember\n1959\nhe was appointed Vice Dean of the Faculty.\nSadosky is best known today as the 'Father of computing in Argentina'. He persuaded the university authorities to set up a Computational Institute and to purchase a computer; a Special Commission comprising of\nAlberto González Domínguez\n, Manuel Sadosky and Simón Leonado Altmann was given the responsibility to study the \"organization and governance of the Computational Institute and present draft regulations and a plan for its needs.\"\nCecilia Berdichevsky\nwrites\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nAfter issuing an international bid that year\n[1957]\n, all members of a Special Commission from the University of Buenos Aires selected the Ferranti Mercury computer to be purchased for the University.... The installation of the Mercury was completed by the beginning of\n1961\n. The reason for such delay was that the chosen room to place the computer, being prepared on the second floor of the new building of the School of Exact and Natural Sciences, was not yet ready and did not suit the required strict Ferranti specifications.\nThe Ferranti Mercury computer was known from the time it was installed as\nClementina\n. This was because it had been programmed to play the song\nOh My Darling, Clementine\n. A small team began work with the new computer led by Manuel Sadosky. The team included Sadosky's collaborator\nRebeca Guber\nand\nCecilia Berdichevsky\n. The Computational Institute, directed by Sadosky, was set up in\n1961\nand began operating the new computer on\n15\nMay in that year. It was highly successful in carrying out tasks for various faculties in the University of Buenos Aires, for institutions such as the National Atomic Energy Commission, and for various private companies. In addition members of the Computational Institute carried out their own researches.\nArturo Illia had become President of Argentina following elections in June\n1963\n. He tried to split the Perónists, who controlled the unions, from their exiled leader Perón. The Perónists reacted by supporting a coup against President Arturo Illia in June\n1966\nand General Juan Carlos Onganía, the commander in chief of the army, took control of the country. Following the military takeover, the University of Buenos Aires was attacked by police in July\n1966\n. Manuel Sadosky was at a Board of Directors meeting on the night of\n29\nJuly when the police arrived at the Faculty and began to attack and arrest teachers, graduates and students in what became known as the 'Night of the Long Batons'. Sadosky, who had been beaten by the police,\nCora Ratto de Sadosky\nand their daughter\nCora Sadosky\nall resigned their positions at the university in protest. They were not alone, for around\n400\nfaculty members resigned in protest at the police brutality directed at the university staff.\nFor a newspaper article which gives details of the problems that the Sadosky family experienced in\n1966\n, see\nTHIS LINK\nand also\nTHIS LINK\n.\nSadosky was keen that those staff fleeing Argentina should remain in South America. His reasoning was that if they went to Europe or the United States they were much less likely to return when the situation in Argentina became better. Along with the engineer Juan Chamero, the mathematician\nRebeca Cherep de Guber\nand the chemist David Jacovkis he created the company called Asesores Ciencia Técnicos S.A. Other members of the Computational Institute worked for the company and in\n1970\nSadosky and the other two founders sold the company to some of those workers. Sadosky spent part of his time in Buenos Aires and part in Montevideo, Uruguay, where he worked for the Computing Centre of the Universidad de la República. He played a major role in the Computing Centre purchasing an IBM\n360\n/\n44\nin October\n1968\n.\nTwo political events in\n1973\nbegan to make Sadosky's presence in both Argentina and Uruguay close to impossible. The June coup in Uruguay led to a dictatorship which aimed repress the left-wing using, most believe, human rights abuses. In\n1973\nJuan Perón returned to Argentina and became President again on\n12\nOctober\n1973\n. He died in the following July, but was succeeded by his wife Isabel Perón. From\n1973\nto\n1976\nthe Argentine Anticommunist Alliance\n(\nknown as the Triple A\n)\nwas a Perónist death squad that killed leftist academics, politicians, union members etc. In\n1974\nthe Argentine Anticommunist Alliance threatened Sadosky and his family who left Argentina and went into exile in Caracas, Venezuela towards the end of\n1974\n, where they lived until\n1979\n. Sadosky worked at the Centro de Estudios de Desarrollo of the Universidad Central de Venezuela\n[\n18\n]\n:-\nHis apartment in Caracas was the meeting place for many Argentines. Tomás Eloy Martínez wrote the first drafts of his book 'La novela de Perón' there, as indicated in the acknowledgments, and it was there that Raúl Alfonsín, passing through the city, met Sadosky through the mediation of the exiled radical leader Adolfo Gass. A mutual sympathy arose immediately between Alfonsín and Sadosky that lasted until the end of Sadosky's life. In Sadosky's obituary that he wrote in Clarín on\n23\nJune\n2005\n, Alfonsín praised him as follows: \"Don Manuel was one of the best men I met in my life. Perhaps, mathematically speaking, the best.\"\nSadosky and his wife\nRatto de Sadosky\nthen went to Barcelona, Spain. There Sadosky was a major player in the creation of the Museum of Science.\nRatto de Sadosky\ndied in Barcelona in January\n1981\n.\nIn\n1983\nArgentina became a democracy under President Raúl Alfonsín. Sadosky had returned to Argentina at the beginning of\n1983\nand worked to support the candidacy of Alfonsín for the presidency. Sadosky was put in charge of Science and Technology within the Centro de Participación Política. A national meeting took place in Buenos Aires in October\n1983\n, a few days before the election which made Alfonsín president. Two documents by Sadosky arising from this meeting were published in\nCiencia, Tecnología y Desarrollo\nⓉ\n(\nScience, technology and development\n)\n. In\nPalabras de clausura del encuentro\nⓉ\n(\nClosing words of the meeting\n)\n, he summed up the proceeding of the meeting. He wrote:-\nIn the first place, it has been rigorous thought that has presided over the elaboration of the fundamental notions and the subsequent discussions. This must be said because ten years ago it became fashionable to replace rigorous thinking with \"popular\" thinking, as if it were pertinent for our society that reasoning be clumsy and conclusions approximate.\nIn his second document\nSuperación de la dependencia económica, social, política y mental\nⓉ\n(\nOvercoming economic, social, political and mental dependency\n)\nhe wrote:-\nThere are very few research works in the technological field, there are no technical theses, nor does the category of doctor of engineering exist. ... In the field of technology, this situation of dependency is reflected in the large number of people who install, repair and maintain equipment, but do not design it. ... We must start innovators very early because the stimulation of creativity has to start at an early age.\nAfter Raúl Alfonsín became President, he appointed Sadosky as Secretary of Science and Technology of the Nation, a role he continued to hold until July\n1989\n. On\n22\nAugust\n1984\nhe was appointed as Emeritus Professor of the University of Buenos Aires where he continued to contribute.\nIn February\n1991\nSadosky married Katún Troise, daughter of a prominent doctor Emilio Troise. Pablo Jacovkis writes in\n[\n18\n]\nabout the last years of Sadosky's life:-\nSeveral of his collaborators continued to meet with him weekly to discuss scientific and technological policy problems, until shortly before his death in\n2005\n, and the appreciation and respect that many scientists, academics and intellectuals always had for him is notable, despite the fact that in many cases their opinions diverged. He remained intellectually active until the end of his life; he was part of the editorial committee of the magazine 'Exactamente', edited by his Faculty of Exact and Natural Sciences of the University of Buenos Aires, and participated very actively in the meetings of its editorial committee.\n(\nHe always arrived accompanied by Katún, who remained, very discreetly, outside the meeting room, waiting for him.\n)\nWe have not mentioned his hobbies so let us note that as a young boy he loved soccer and, up to the age of\n14\n, wanted to be a professional soccer player. He supported Club Atlético San Lorenzo de Almagro all his life. Another of his great loves was the cinema.\nSadosky was awarded many honours. The Universidad Nacional del Litoral awarded him an honorary degree in\n1994\n, as did the Universidad de la República, in Montevideo in December\n2001\n. In\n2003\nthe City of Buenos Aires declared him an Illustrious Citizen of the city. The book\nHonoris causa: El Legado De Manuel Sadosky\nⓉ\n(\nHonoris causa: The legacy of Manuel Sadosky\n)\nwas planned to celebrate Sadosky's\n90\nth birthday and published in\n2005\n. Eleven articles from that book are listed in the References to this biography. Let us end with a couple of quotes, the first from\n[\n19\n]\n, one of the articles in this book:-\nI think that Manuel is what is said to be a teacher. He created computing in Argentina; he promoted applied mathematics; supported science, education and scientific popularisation; he helped any young people who asked him for advice and counselling. His influence is felt not only in our country, but also in Uruguay, in Venezuela, in Spain, and in many other countries.\nJorge Marirrodriga writes\n[\n26\n]\n:-\nHis work stood out for a tireless interest in the training of scientists and for the attempt to convince political and academic authorities that the true wealth of a country is deposited in the brains of its citizens and not in the reserves of the Central Bank.\nThe last tribute he received during his lifetime was endless applause when he attended, ten days before his death, the presentation of the Information and Communication Technologies Competitiveness Forum. He died at the age of\n91\nfollowing a pulmonary spasm, complicated with cardiovascular problems. He was cremated in Memorial Park. He received posthumously the Premio Konex de Honor\n2006\n: Humanidades. The centenary of his birth was marked with the publication of the book\nManuel Sadosky: El sabio de la tribu\nⓉ\n(\nManuel Sadosky: The wise man of the tribe\n)\n(2014)\n.",
