His mother was  Jane Hardie\n(\nborn Culross, Perthshire\n(\nnow in Fife\n)\nabout\n1837)\n.

He then studied at the University of Edinburgh, first matriculating in\n1890\n. Hardie studied Chemistry and Practical Chemistry with Crum Brown, Botany and Practical Botany with Balfour, Zoology and Practical Zoology, Mathematics with\nChrystal\n, and Natural Philosophy with\nTait\n.\nHe graduated with an M.A. with Honours in Mathematics and Natural Philosophy and the degree of B.Sc. in April\n1898\n. On his way to this degree he passed the First B.Sc. Chemistry and Practical Chemistry examinations in April\n1895\n, Botany and Zoology in July\n1895\n, Second B.Sc. Higher Mathematics and Natural Philosophy in April\n1898\nhaving failed the examinations for these two courses a year earlier. He worked at Sharp's Institution, Perth in\n1899\n-\n1900\n, The Academy, Rothesay in\n1900\n-\n1901\n, and Hutcheson's Grammar School, Glasgow in\n1901\n-\n02\n.\nHardie then went to Egypt where he worked as a Lecturer in Physics. He was at appointed by the Ministry of Public Instruction of Egypt to Ras-el-Tin Government School, Alexandria in\n1904\n.
