  "biografia": "Jonathan Borwein\n(\nknown as Jon\n)\nwas the son of\nDavid Borwein\nand Bessie Flax.\nDavid Borwein\nhad been born in Lithuania but was brought up and educated to B.Sc. level in South Africa. He married Bessie, who was studying Botany and Zoology at the University of Witwatersrand, on\n30\nJune\n1946\nin Yeoville, Johannesburg. They emigrated to Britain in\n1948\nand\nDavid\nwas awarded a Ph.D. in mathematics from the University of London in\n1950\n. In the same year he was appointed as a lecturer in mathematics at the University of St Andrews in Scotland. In St Andrews the Borwein family lived at Alvie, Buchanan Gardens\n(1950\n-\n1953)\n, West View Cottage, Lade Braes Lane\n(1954\n-\n1958)\n, and then\n4\nAbbotsford Place\n(1959)\n. They had a house built at\n10\nStrathkinness High Road\n(\nWest Acres\n)\nand moved into the house in\n1960\n.\nDavid\nand Bessie's three children were all born in St Andrews: Jonathan Michael Borwein, the subject of this biography, was born on\n20\nMay\n1951\n;\nPeter Benjamin Borwein\n, also an exceptionally talented mathematician, was born on\n10\nMay\n1953\n; and Sarah Tanya Borwein, who became a medical doctor, was born in\n1961\n.\nJonathan and\nPeter\nhad a happy childhood.\nPeter Borwein\nsaid\n[\n26\n]\n:-\nI have fond memories of growing up with Jon, as young boys in St Andrews, Scotland. An early memory of Jon is of us fishing off the pier in St Andrews with our dad\nDavid\n. We would catch rock cod, and make my mother Bessie clean them and make fish cakes. This delighted Jon. He and I also spent much of our childhood with our guinea pigs, Gilbert and Gulliver. My dad built a cage for them with no bottom, so that the guinea pigs would move around the lawn, acting as lawnmowers. As young boys we also shared a bedroom in St Andrews. I used to keep Jon awake at night, by reminding him that the universe was infinite. This bothered him to no end. It's no surprise that he ended up as a mathematician.\nWhen Jon was six years old, his father bet his St Andrews colleagues that he could teach Jon to solve two-by-two simultaneous linear equations by making it into a game. Although not understanding the meaning or significance of this game, nevertheless Jon loved it and taught his best friend to play it.\nJon attended Madras College, the main state school in St Andrews, entering the junior school in\n1956\n. He excelled at this school and in September\n1962\nhe was chosen as one of the four pupils to represent the school on the Top of the Form quiz. This was the first year that the popular quiz for secondary schools moved from being a radio programme to become a television programme. The youngest member of the team of four had to be under\n13\nand\n11\nyear old Jon filled that spot.\nIn\n1963\nDavid Borwein\nbecame a professor at the University of Western Ontario and Jon moved with his family to London, Ontario, Canada. Jon continued his schooling in London, Ontario and graduated from High School in\n1967\nat the age of sixteen. Later that same year he enrolled at the University of Western Ontario and had a remarkably successful career being awarded a Timkins International Fund Scholarship in\n1968\n, an Albert O Jeffrey Scholarship in\n1969\n, and a University of Western Ontario Faculty Association Scholarship in\n1971\n. If the reader assumes that with a mathematician for a father, Jon always wanted to be a mathematician, then they would be wrong. In fact he started university intending to become a historian, but changed to mathematics in his second year. We might also assume that studying mathematics at the University of Western Ontario, where his father was a mathematics professor, would mean that Jon would attend classes taught by his father. This did not happen, however, since his father made sure Jon did not take his courses. Jon did remember some of his lecturers being less than perfect\n[\n25\n]\n:-\nFrom my days as an undergraduate in the late sixties I recall Peter Fraser, a mathematical physicist at Western Ontario, whose flawless lectures persuaded my second year mechanics class that no effort was required on their part, until a failing grade on the final proved otherwise, and my to be-nameless third year number theory teacher, a non-researcher whose stolid indifference to scholarship could not destroy a for-me magical subject.\nIn\n1970\n, while at the University of Western Ontario, Jon met Judith D S Roots. They married in Oxford, England in\n1973\nand had three daughters: Rachel Laura Borwein\n(\nborn\n28\nMarch\n1976)\n, who was awarded a Ph.D. in Veterinary Medicine; Naomi Simone Borwein, who was awarded a Ph.D. in English literature and became a poet and writer; and Tova Rebekah Borwein\n(\nborn\n5\nDecember\n1991)\n, who became an Operations Analyst at Screenrights in Sydney, Australia.\nIn\n1971\nJon Borwein was awarded a B.A. with Honours in Mathematics and received the Kingston Gold Medal for Honours Mathematics. He was awarded an Ontario Rhodes Scholarship to study at Jesus College, University of Oxford, England\n[\n6\n]\n:-\nJon won a\n1971\nRhodes Scholarship and settled into life at Oxford. His classes allowed him to rub shoulders with the likes of\nMichael Atiyah\n, Professor of Geometry, who actually attended a class on mathematical Linguistics with Jon.\nAtiyah\noften sat unheeding and would then ask the professor dumb basic questions about the lecture. At a much later time at a conference\nAtiyah\nlaughed and said that Jon had certainly gotten more from the class than he did.\nAt Oxford, Borwein was advised by Michael Alan Howarth Dempster\n(\nborn\n1938)\n. Dempster, born in Ontario, Canada with a first degree from the University of Toronto, was, at the time he supervised Borwein's postgraduate studies, writing the book\nIntroduction to Optimization Methods\nwhich was an introduction to non-linear methods of optimisation. Borwein was awarded an M.Sc. in\n1968\nhaving submitted the thesis\nMonotone Operators and Non-Linear Functional Analysis\n. He was awarded a D.Phil. in\n1974\nfor his thesis\nOptimization with Respect to Partial Orderings\n. The Abstract to the thesis begins:\nThe thesis is primarily concerned with optimisation problems which have objective functions which do not take values on the real line.\nAfter the award of his doctorate, Borwein returned to Canada where he was appointed as a Post Doctoral Fellow at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia. At Dalhousie, he joined a strong functional analysis group. After one year he was promoted to Lecturer and Research Associate in\n1975\n, then to Assistant Professor in the following year.\nOn\n28\nMarch\n1976\nJon and Judi's daughter Rachel Laura Borwein was born and in July of that year Jon, Judi and their daughter Rachel, together with Jon's sister Sarah\n(\naged\n15)\nand his parents\nDavid Borwein\nand Bessie Borwein all attended the St Andrews Colloquium in St Andrews, Scotland. I\n[\nEFR\n]\nwas also at the Colloquium and\nDavid Borwein\n, who had taught me analysis, introduced me to Jon Borwein. Jon had been particularly keen to attend, not only to revisit the town in which he spent the first twelve years of his life, but also to attend Heini Halberstam's course on Number Theory.\nBorwein's first four papers were all published in\n1976\n. These are:\nFractional programming without differentiability\n;\nA note on Fritz John sufficiency\n;\n(\nwith R O'Brien\n)\nTangent cones and convexity\n; and\n(\nwith M Edelstein and R O'Brien\n)\nVisibility and starshape\n. In the first of these he gives the acknowledgement:-\nAcknowledgements are due to Drs C Field and W R S Sutherland with whom I have discussed this subject and especially to Dr M A H Dempster, my former supervisor, who introduced me to convex analysis.\nChristopher A Field and William R S Sutherland, mentioned in this quote, were colleagues of Borwein's at Dalhousie University. His two co-authors are Richard C O'Brien and Michael Edelstein who were on the faculty of Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada, and Dalhousie University, respectively. Borwein describes Edelstein as\n[\n25\n]\n:-\n... a Polish-Israeli functional analyst who by example and engagement converted a generation of young analysts into full-blooded independent researchers.\nBorwein continued to be promoted at Dalhousie University, becoming an Associate Professor with Tenure in\n1980\n. He was then given leave of absence and spent the following two years at Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA. Richard Brent writes\n[\n28\n]\n:-\nHis early work included papers on operations research, semi-definite programming, and integer programming. After moving to Carnegie-Mellon University in\n1980\n, he added variational analysis.\nJon Borwein's brother,\nPeter Borwein\n, was also an exceptionally gifted mathematician and the brothers became colleagues at Dalhousie University in\n1980\nwhen\nPeter Borwein\nwas appointed there as an assistant professor. Their first joint paper was\nA very rapidly convergent product expansion for π\nwhich was published in\n1983\n. This was the first of\n35\npapers on which the brothers were co-authors and these soon led to Jon Borwein being known to his friends and students as 'Doctor π'.\nPeter Borwein\nexplains what it was like working with his brother\n[\n26\n]\n:-\nHe had a remarkable clock speed, a term he liked to use for how fast people worked. He could accomplish in a day or two what took other people weeks, which is one of the reasons he was so prolific. ... I would like to comment on how we worked together, which was intensive. And I also want to comment on the fact that many people thought we ought to compete, that there ought to be sibling rivalry. In fact there really was no rivalry. He was a very generous co-author. Not always an easy co-author\n(\nhe could be very demanding\n)\n, but he was always generous with ideas, and with acknowledgment, and with giving credit, not just to me, but to his graduate students, and colleagues - whom he could drive very hard, but if they could keep up with him the pay-off was rewarding. He was obviously very smart. But what doesn't show necessarily is that he had a phenomenal memory. When he worked on a problem intensely he would store the facts and not have to look them up.\nFor other comments about Jon Borwein's character, see the extracts from tributes at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nLet us continue to record Borwein's career. In\n1984\nhe was made a full professor at Dalhousie University continuing in this role until\n1993\n. During the last two years of that period,\n1991\n-\n93\nhe was on leave from Dalhousie University to allow him to spend the years as professor in Department of Combinatorics and Optimization at Waterloo University in Ontario, Canada.\nYasumasa Kanada\n(1949\n-\n2020)\nwas a computer scientist working at the Computer Centre, University of Tokyo, Japan. He was, like Borwein, interested in calculating π to many decimal places, for example in\n1983\nhe published the paper\nCalculation of π to\n4\n,\n194\n,\n293\nDecimals Based on the Gauss-Legendre Algorithm\n. Borwein met Kanada in\n1985\n[\n16\n]\n:-\nIn\n1985\nwhile on sabbatical, Jon went to Cambridge, England and then Limoges, France. While in Cambridge Jon received a redirected Christmas card from Yasumasa Kanada, a professor in the Department of Information Science at the University of Tokyo in Tokyo, Japan. He looked at the return address and was astonished to see that Kanada was in Cambridge as well. There was a meeting and this led to fruitful discussions about computer modelling algorithms and π. This friendship lasted until Kanada's retirement in\n2015\n. When asked why a computer scientist would come to such a place as Cambridge, Kanada replied that he was looking to imbibe the theoretical underpinnings and classical view of his work. This was something he could not get at home.\nBoth Jon Borwein and\nPeter Borwein\nmade deep contributions to the study of π and they co-authored the outstanding book\nPi and the AGM: A Study in Analytic Number Theory and Computational Complexity\n(1987)\n. For information about this book, including extracts from several reviews, see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nAs well as working with his brother\nPeter\n, Jon Borwein worked with his father\nDavid Borwein\n. They co-authored\n33\npapers starting with\nConvergence of lattice sums and Madelung's constant\nin\n1985\n. Since Jon Borwein wrote over\n30\npapers with his brother and over\n30\npapers with his father, one might expect several papers jointly authored by all three Borweins. In fact there is only one paper with Jon,\nPeter\nand\nDavid\nall as authors, namely\nGiuga's conjecture on primality\n(1996)\nin\nThe American Mathematical Monthly\n.\nJon and\nPeter Borwein\nhad shown themselves to be amazing expositors with their first book\nPi and the AGM.\nFor example, Peter Cass had written in the review\n[\n31\n]\n:-\nThis exciting and well-written book is the product of the sound scholarship and enormous enthusiasm of its authors.\nThe two, with the third author David Bailey, wrote the paper\nRamanujan, modular equations and pi or how to compute a billion digits of pi\nwhich was published in the\nAmerican Mathematical Monthly\nin\n1989\n. This paper won the three authors two major prizes: the\nChauvenet\nPrize of the\nMathematical Association of America\n1993\nfor the:-\n... outstanding survey or expository mathematics paper published in a North American Journal ...\nand the Merten M Hasse Prize from the\nMathematical Association of America\n, also in\n1993\n, for a:-\n... noteworthy expository paper in an Association Journal one of whose authors is younger than forty ...\nIn\n1987\nAdrian Lewis became Borwein's postdoctoral student. He writes\n[\n42\n]\n:-\nEarly in\n1987\nJon had welcomed me to the delightful city of Halifax, Nova Scotia - then his home. During a two-year postdoctoral fellowship, I shadowed him closely on his travels. Astonishingly, among his many projects then was a 'Dictionary of Mathematics', and indeed I felt a kind of prosaic Boswell to his dizzying Samuel Johnson.\n...\nJon and his family - his wife, Judi, and two young daughters, Rachel and Naomi\n(\ntheir sister Tova being yet to arrive\n)\n- more or less adopted me as a family member when I arrived in Canada. I essentially lived with them during month-long visits to Limoges, France\n(\nwhere Jon later received an honorary doctorate\n)\n, to the Technion in Israel, and to Canberra and Newcastle, Australia. The sheer fun of that last visit probably inspired the Borweins' later choice of adopted home.\nLife at the Borweins' home was an inspiring and exhausting blur. A typical evening involved prodigious and virtuoso culinary feats from Judi, feisty debates from Rachel and Naomi, and multiple simultaneous media playing at full volume. At a minimum, these included political news\n(\nJon was intensely active, politically, serving for a while as treasurer of the Nova Scotia New Democratic Party\n)\n, major league baseball\n(\nanother domain of erudition\n)\n, and music. All gradually dissolved into large glasses of Scotch\n(\nJon's Scotchness, like Healey Willan's, was mostly \"by absorption\"\n)\n, and then a call to arms from Jon to prove some reluctant theorem. The exuberant and dizzying environment mirrored Jon's mathematics, a style so appealing it quickly sealed my own career choice as a mathematician.\nBorwein had always been interested in experimental mathematics. He defined 'experimental mathematics' in the blog\nWill computers replace humans in mathematics?\nwhich he wrote on\n1\nJune\n2016\n:-\nSo what exactly is experimental mathematics? It is best defined as a mode of research that employs computers as a \"laboratory,\" in the same sense that a physicist, chemist, biologist or engineer performs an experiment to, for example, gain insight and intuition, test and falsify conjecture, and confirm results proved by conventional means.\nFor a longer extract from this blog, and other writings by Borwein, see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nIn\n1993\nBorwein moved to Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada where he was appointed Gordon M Shrum Professor of Science in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics. At Simon Fraser University he founded the Centre for Experimental and Constructive Mathematics\n[\n51\n]\n:-\nJon's purpose in this endeavour was for Centre for Experimental and Constructive Mathematics to be become a centre of excellence that would attract world-class scholars interested in the interaction between mathematics and computer applications.\nThe\nSimon Fraser University Mathematics and Statistics Newsletter\nof June\n1995\nreported on one of the achievements of the Centre for Experimental and Constructive Mathematics\n[\n49\n]\n:-\nA team of mathematicians from Simon Fraser University, working with a colleague in Japan, has calculated the value of pi to a new world record of almost\n4\n,\n294\n,\n967\n,\n286\ndecimal places. A printout of the number, expressed at six digits per centimetre, would stretch more than\n7\n,\n000\nkilometres. The new world record was achieved using computer formulae, or algorithms, developed by the brothers Jonathan and\nPeter Borwein\n, of Simon Fraser University's Centre for Experimental and Constructive Mathematics. The Borweins worked with Dr Yasumasa Kanada of the University of Tokyo's computing centre. The calculation was completed on a HITACS-\n3900\n/\n480\nvector supercomputer and took\n56\nhours. The results have since been verified.\nBorwein worked on producing two volumes on experimental mathematics. The first, co-authored with David Bailey, was\nMathematics by Experiment: Plausible Reasoning in the\n21\nst Century\n(2004)\n, while the second, co-authored with David Bailey and Ronald Girgensohn, was\nExperimentation in Mathematics: Computational Paths to Discovery\n(2004)\n. You can read extracts from the prefaces and extracts from reviews of these two books and of other books by Borwein on experimental mathematics at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nIn\n1994\nBorwein was elected a Fellow of the\nRoyal Society of Canada\n. This was the first of many honours given to Borwein. The British Columbia Confederation of University Faculty Associations made both Jon and\nPeter Borwein\n'Academics of the Year' in\n1996\n. He was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Limoges in\n1999\n, elected a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in\n2001\n, and elected a foreign member of the\nBulgarian Academy of Sciences\nin\n2003\n.\nIn\n2004\nBorwein returned to Dalhousie University when he was appointed as Research Professor in the Faculty of Computer Science and held the Canada Research Chair in Collaborative Technology. In\n2009\nBorwein moved to Australia when he was appointed Laureate Professor in the School of Mathematical and Physical Sciences at the University of Newcastle, New South Wales. He was also appointed as director of the research centre for Computer Assisted Research Mathematics and its Applications\n(\nCARMA\n)\n. In March\n2010\nhe was elected to the\nAustralian Academy of Science\n. Two conferences were organised to celebrate his\n60\nth birthday in\n2011\n, one in Canada and the other in Australia. The first was in May\n2011\nat the Interdisciplinary Research in the Mathematical and Computational Sciences Centre at Simon Fraser University, while the second was in November\n2011\nat the centre for Computer Assisted Research Mathematics and its Applications at the University of Newcastle, New South Wales. In\n2015\nhe was elected a Fellow of the\nAmerican Mathematical Society\n:-\nFor contributions to non-smooth analysis and classical analysis as well as experimental mathematics and visualisation of mathematics.\nHis work in Australia was recognised with the Distinguished Service Award in\n2017\n, a year after his untimely death\n[\n5\n]\n:-\nJon's deep international leadership experience, coupled with his great generosity of spirit, was of extraordinary value to the mathematical sciences in Australia and to Australian Mathematical Sciences Institute\n(\nAMSI\n)\nin particular. Even prior to his arrival here Jon contributed to the establishment of the AMSI Access Grid Room network. He continued to be a champion of this initiative once he arrived in Australia and CARMA at Newcastle provided us with deep technical advice as well as academic engagement.\nDuring his leadership of the Scientific Advisory Committee he encouraged wider access, especially by younger research leaders, to AMSI's workshop program and oversaw the successful program collaboration with the Australian Mathematical Society. His energetic and always thoughtful engagement with the Board, the AMSI Members and the committees was outstanding.\nJon was an intense driver of collaboration and was himself an inveterate speaker and collaborator, always encouraging his hosts to make use of AMSI's support. He had a natural affinity with AMSI's collaborative model and his strategic view of the world made his contribution singular and his loss acute. This medal is therefore awarded with the deepest respect.\nIn\n2016\nBorwein returned to Canada to spend a few months as Distinguished Scholar in Residence at Western University in London, Ontario. He died suddenly when nearing the end of that visit. A conference was held in his honour in Newcastle, Australia, in September\n2017\n. Many of Borwein's colleagues and collaborators presented papers at the conference and the proceeding was published in\n2020\nunder the title\nFrom Analysis to Visualization: A Celebration of the Life and Legacy of Jonathan M Borwein\n.",
