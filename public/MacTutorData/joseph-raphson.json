  "biografia": "It appears that\nJoseph Raphson\n's parents were Ruth and James Raphson, although this cannot be confirmed with absolute certainty. James Raphson's will is dated October,\n1689\n, and he was buried in Pinner churchyard in Middlesex. Joseph's life can only be deduced from a number of pointers. No obituary of Raphson seems to have been written and we can now only piece together details about his life from records which exist such at University of Cambridge records and records of the Royal Society. It is through the University of Cambridge records that we know that Raphson graduated with an M.A. from Jesus College Cambridge in\n1692\nbut it is almost certain that he never studied at Cambridge since the M.A. is by Royal warrant. His birth date was given as\n1649\nby\nFlorian Cajori\n, but a date of\n1668\nseems much more likely. In fact someone of the name \"Joseph Raphson\" was baptised in the Parish Church in Pinner, Middlesex in the\n1660\ns and, again it cannot be proved with certainly that this is the Joseph Raphson of this biography but it does seem highly probable. Our date of\n1668\nseems to be essentially confirmed by the following statement made in\n1691\n:-\n... insomuch that if he continues to prosecute these Studies, as he hath begun, it is not to be doubted but that he will become one of the most skilful Mathematicians that are now living; since at the Age of\n22\nYears, he hath already attained to so great a Knowledge in those abstruse and difficult Sciences: Wherefore what improvement may we from not expect from the extraordinary Judgement of his riper Years? insomuch that if he continues to prosecute these Studies, as he hath begun, it is not to be doubted but that he will become one of the most skilful Mathematicians that are now living; since at the Age of\n22\nYears, he hath already attained to so great a Knowledge in those abstruse and difficult Sciences: Wherefore what improvement may we from not expect from the extraordinary Judgement of his riper Years?\nFor the review that this statement is taken from, see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nRather remarkably Raphson was made a member of the\nRoyal Society\nin\n1689\nwhen, if our date of birth is correct, he was only\n21\nyears of age. He was proposed for election by\nEdmond Halley\nat the meeting of the\nRoyal Society\non Wednesday\n27\nNovember\n1689\n.\nHalley\nhad himself been elected to the\nRoyal Society\nat the early age of\n22\n. Raphson was elected a fellow at the meeting on Saturday\n30\nNovember\n1689\nand, four days later, he signed the Charter Book of the Society. At the same time, he signed a bond to pay his quarterly subscription to the\nRoyal Society\non which he described himself as:-\nJoseph Raphson of London Gent.\nRaphson's election to that Society was on the strength of work which was published in his book\nAnalysis aequationum universalis\nⓉ\n(\nUniversal analysis of equations\n)\nin\n1690\n.\nEdmond Halley\nhad reported on Raphson's work at the meeting of the Society on\n30\nJuly\n1690\nas recorded in the Minutes:-\nMr\nHalley\nrelated that Mr Raphson had Invented a method of Solving all sorts of Equations, and giving their Roots in Infinite Series, which Converge apace, and that he had desired of him an Equation of the fifth power to be proposed to him, to which he returned Answers true to Seven Figures in much less time than it could have been effected by the Known methods of\nVieta\n.\nThis method invented by Raphson and described in his book\nAnalysis aequationum universalis\nⓉ\n(\nUniversal analysis of equations\n)\nis now called the\nNewton\nmethod\n(\nor the\nNewton\n-Raphson method\n)\nfor approximating the roots of an equation. In\nMethod of Fluxions\nNewton\ndescribes the same method and, as an example, finds the root of\nx\n3\n−\n2\nx\n−\n5\n=\n0\nx^{3} - 2x - 5 = 0\nx\n3\n−\n2\nx\n−\n5\n=\n0\nlying between\n2\nand\n3\n. Although written in\n1671\nit was not published until\n1736\n, so Raphson published the result nearly\n50\nyears before\nNewton\n. The Minutes of the meeting of the\nRoyal Society\non Wednesday\n17\nDecember\n1690\ncontain a reference to Raphson's\nAnalysis aequationum universalis\nⓉ\n(\nUniversal analysis of equations\n)\n:-\nMr Raphson's Book was this day produced by\nE Halley\n, wherein he gives a Notable Improvement of the method of Resolution of all sorts of Equations Showing how to Extract their Roots by a General Rule, which doubles the known figures of the Root known by each Operation, So that by repeating\n3\nor\n4\ntimes he finds them true to Numbers of\n8\nor\n10\nplaces. The Society being highly pleased with this his performance Ordered him their thanks with their Desires, that he would please to Continue to prosecute those Studies, wherein he hath been so Successful.\nA copy of Raphson's book was presented as \"a gift from the author\" to the Society on Saturday\n17\nJanuary\n1691\n.\nYou can see some information about the Newton-Raphson method at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nRaphson's relation to\nNewton\nis important but not particularly well understood. In\n[\n2\n]\nCopenhaver writes:-\nRaphson was one of the few people whom\nNewton\nallowed to see his mathematical papers. As early as\n1691\n, he and\nEdmond Halley\nwere involved in plans to publish\nNewton\n's work of the early\n1670\n's on\nquadrature\nof curves, a project fulfilled only in\n1704\n, and then in a much different form. In\n1711\n,\nRoger Cotes\nand\nWilliam Jones\narranged for Raphson to see some of\nNewton\n's papers \"... pertinent to his design of writing an History of the Method of Fluxions.\"\nWe note that the authors of\n[\n3\n]\nsay they have seen no evidence to justify the statements by Copenhaver in the first two sentences of the above quote. Raphson did indeed write his History of Fluxions which did not appear until\n1715\n, after Raphson had died, under the title\nHistoria fluxionum\n. It is unclear how pleased\nNewton\nwas with this work despite its clear position in favour of\nNewton\n's claims over those of\nLeibniz\n. Certain letters which had passed between\nNewton\nand\nLeibniz\nappeared as an appendix to a reprint of Raphson's book in\n1716\n-\n1718\n.\n(\nThis is discussed further at the end of this biography.\n)\nImmediately a row broke out and\nJohann Bernoulli\nshowed his anger. An attempt was made by\nNewton\nto calm things down when he wrote to\nJohann Bernoulli\nsaying:-\nI stopt\n[\nRaphson's 'History of Fluxions'\n]\ncoming abroad for three or four years.\nHowever,\nNewton\nadmitted in a letter to\nPierre Varignon\nthat he was responsible for the letter being added to Raphson's book:-\nWhen I heard that Mr\nLeibniz\nwas dead I caused what had passed between him and me to be printed at the end of Raphson's book because copies thereof had been dispersed by Mr\nLeibniz\n.\nThis was not Raphson's only publication relating to\nNewton\n's work. He translated\nNewton\n's algebraic work from Latin to English.\nNewton\n's\nArithmetica universalis\nⓉ\n(\nUniversal arithmetic\n)\nwas translated by Raphson and was published as\nUniversal arithmetick\nin\n1720\nafter Raphson's death.\nEarly in his career Raphson published a mathematical dictionary. In\n1691\n, the year Raphson was elected to the\nRoyal Society\n,\nJacques Ozanam\npublished\nDictionnaire mathématique\n. Raphson produced his shorter version\nA mathematical dictionary\nin\n1702\nwhich is:-\nA mathematical dictionary or a compendious explication of all mathematical terms, abridg'd from Monsieur\nOzanam\nand others ... written by J Raphson FRS.\nRaphson published a second edition of his analysis book and, at the same time, appended his article\nDe spatio reali\nⓉ\n(\nReal space\n)\nwhich is an application of mathematical reasoning to theological issues. Raphson wrote a second theological work\nDemonstratio de deo\nⓉ\n(\nDemonstration of God\n)\nin\n1710\n. You can read detailed reviews of both of these works at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nDe spatio reali\nⓉ\n(\nReal space\n)\ndiscusses space and in it Raphson talks of 'real space' which he thinks of as being independent of the mind that perceives it. He discusses the infinite, distinguishing between the potentially infinite and the actual infinite. In discussing motion he argues that space is infinite but the collection of moving objects in it is finite.\nRaphson's ideas of space and philosophy were based on Cabalist ideas. The Cabala was a Jewish mysticism which was influential from the\n12\nth century on. It was an oral tradition and initiation into its doctrines and practices was passed on. Cabala developed several basic doctrines which were strong influences on Raphson's philosophical thinking. The doctrines included the withdrawal of the divine light, thereby creating primordial space, the sinking of luminous particles into matter and a \"cosmic restoration\" that is achieved by Jews through living a mystical life.\nIn these two works by Raphson\nDe spatio reali\nⓉ\n(\nReal space\n)\nand\nDemonstratio de deo\nⓉ\n(\nDemonstration of God\n)\n,\ncosmology\n, natural philosophy, mathematics and his Cabalist beliefs combine. Of course his religious beliefs greatly influenced all his thinking.\nNewton\n's views of space were strongly influenced by Christian beliefs, and possible just slightly by his interaction with Raphson.\nLet us now say a little about the date of\n1712\nthat we have given for Raphson's death.\nCotes\ncorresponded with Raphson in\n1709\nand, writing to\nWilliam Jones\nin February\n1711\n, he mentions Raphson whom he certainly believes to be alive at that time. When Raphson's\nHistoria fluxionum\nⓉ\n(\nHistory of fluxions\n)\nwas published in\n1715\nthe title page states:-\nThe history of fluxions, showing in a compendious manner the first rise of, and various improvements made in that incomparable method. By\n(\nthe late\n)\nMr Joseph Raphson,\nThis shows clearly that by\n1715\nRaphson had died. There is further evidence for the\n1712\ndate but it is a little confusing. We mentioned above that after\nLeibniz\ndied in November\n1716\n,\nNewton\nproduced an appendix to Raphson's\nHistoria fluxionum\nⓉ\n(\nHistory of fluxions\n)\nbut, relevant to the date of Raphson's death, retained the same\n1715\npublication date on the work.\nNewton\n's appendix states clearly that Raphson had died three years earlier. If we assume that\nNewton\ndeliberately kept the\n1715\ndate on the book despite the appendix being added one or even two years later, then one assumes that he would write that Raphson died three years earlier if he died in\n1712\n. A date of late\n1712\nwould also be consistent with the fact that Raphson's name appears in the\n1712\nlist of fellows of the\nRoyal Society\nbut not in the\n1713\nlist.\nThe difficulty of finding details of Raphson's life are puzzling as the authors of\n[\n3\n]\nwrite:-\nIt is quite curious that other biographical details about Raphson are so hard to find. He was very well educated, and yet we have been unable to trace his school, but we do know that it was not Westminster ... His middle books are rather heavy-going theologically oriented affairs which display an extraordinary degree of scholarship\n(\nincluding a knowledge of the cabala\n)\nnormally to be found only in a man with a university education, yet there remains no evidence that he actually studied at either Oxford or Cambridge, and no reason to think that he went elsewhere either. His apparent wealth would also suggest that we should be able to find poll records or a will, but so far these have not been traced. ... the possibility that he ... was of Irish extraction seems quite real, and could go a long way in explaining why he left so few traces in England.",
