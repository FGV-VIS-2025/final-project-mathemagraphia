  "biografia": "Bernt Holmboe\nwas the son of the priest Jens Ottesen Holmboe\n(25\nMarch\n1746\n-\n24\nApril\n1823)\nand his wife Cathrine Holst\n(4\nMay\n1763\n-\n25\nApril\n1823)\n. Jens, whose father Otto Holmboe\n(1710\n-\n1773)\nhad also been a priest, had been the incumbent at Vang for three years before Bernt was born. Bernt's mother Cathrine was gentle and loving but suffered from poor health and later in life was often confined to bed. Jens and Cathrine had seventeen children and Bernt was one of nine who reached adulthood. The boys were, starting from the eldest, Otto\n(1786\n-\n1858)\n, Hans\n(1787\n-\n1844)\n, Bernt Michael, Christopher Andreas\n(1796\n-\n1882)\n, Henrik Ancher\n(1798\n-\n1856)\nand Hans Peder\n(1804\n-\n1841)\n. Otto became a merchant, Hans became a priest, and Christopher Andreas studied mathematics but became a professor in oriental languages at the University of Oslo. Two of Bernt's elder sisters, Maren Ancher\n(\nborn\n1790)\nand Elen Gunhilde\n(\nborn\n1794)\nmarried sons of Jacob Wilse who had been the parish priest at Eidsberg; Jens Holmboe left Vang to succeed Jacob Wilse at Eidsberg in\n1801\n. Bernt was six years old when the family moved to Eidsberg, a town about\n50\nkm southeast of Christiania\n(\nrenamed Oslo in\n1925)\n. He did not attend school in Eidsberg, however, but was tutored at home until he reached the age of fifteen when he was sent to the Cathedral School of Christiania. This famous school, founded in\n1153\n, had originally educated boys who were to become priests in the Roman Catholic Church. All teaching had been in Latin but a few years before Holmboe studied there major changes had taken place: teaching was in Norwegian and specialist subject teachers were employed. He spent four years at the Cathedral School during which time he studied mathematics at a higher level than the normal course required. He graduated from the Cathedral School in\n1814\nand matriculated as a student in the Royal Frederick University of Christiania.\nThe Royal Frederick University\n(\nDet Kongelige Frederiks Universitet\n)\nhad only opened in Christiania in\n1813\nafter the Danish King Frederick VI granted Norway the right to its own university in\n1811\n. The first idea was to put the university in Kongsberg but in\n1812\nthe plans were changed and buildings were rented in Christiania. Only after Holmboe's death did the university move into its own buildings\n(\nin\n1852)\n. When Holmboe began his studies there he was one of only seventeen students, taught by six lecturers. His university career did not begin in a very calm way due to the political situation at the time. Norway and Denmark had been united from the end of the fourteenth century but the Napoleonic wars between England and France saw Norway blockaded from\n1807\n, causing much hardship. Many Norwegians felt that the country needed its own voice but, after the defeat of Denmark by Sweden in\n1813\n, Denmark handed Norway over to Sweden. At this point the Norwegians declared independence but this provoked Sweden to attack them in July\n1814\n. Holmboe was the leader of the students who were strongly opposed to Swedish troops in the country in the short fourteen-day military campaign.\nIn\n1815\nHolmboe was appointed as assistant to the astronomer Christopher Hansteen at Christiania. In this year Hansteen, in addition to his university duties, became director of the Christiania Observatory and the editor of the Norwegian almanac. He needed a good mathematician to assist him with his mathematical calculations and Holmboe certainly filled this role. In\n1818\nHolmboe became a teacher at the Cathedral School of Christiania. Hans Peter Bader, the teacher of mathematics at the Cathedral School had been dismissed in December\n1817\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nThe School's reputation had fallen into disrepute. ... in the midst of the critical situation in which the School found itself right before Christmas,\n1817\n, Rector Rosted was forced to hire two more of his former bright students: Bernt Michael Holmboe and Johan Aubert. It was the twenty-three year old Holmboe who now succeeded Bader in the teaching of mathematics. ...\n[\nHe\n]\nquickly became an inspirational feature of the School.\nIn fact Jacob Rosted first offered the mathematics teaching position to Christopher Andreas Holmboe who was trained in the subject but by this time he had decided to make a career in oriental languages so turned down the offer. Bernt Michael was then offered the post and he gladly accepted; in fact he was well suited to a teaching position\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nHolmboe ... had received a little teaching experience at the newly-opened Institute of Commerce, and above all, he had a well-thought-out view of what mathematics really was and how best it could be learned.\nIn his first year teaching at the School he became the mathematics teacher of\nNiels Henrik Abel\nwho had been a pupil there since\n1815\n. All agree that Holmboe's teaching was the first step in making\nAbel\na world-class mathematician, so it is reasonable to look briefly at the way in which he taught\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nIt was the unique symbols that divided mathematics from all the other sciences. Therefore it was essential that these symbols be learned through drills, and that the teacher, through constant repetition, train the disciples to see the significance of notation. ... Before Holmboe undertook anything, he therefore got the students to repeat in words what the mathematical statement expressed; and vice versa: when the pupil heard a proposition expressed in words, he had to learn to write it down in mathematical notation. Holmboe stressed that the teacher had to prepare the foundations by which the beginner could easily learn without too great an effort, by not moving forward too quickly, not working at too abstract a level and going lightly over the most difficult propositions until everything contained therein had been learned.\nWhen Holmboe wrote a report on his pupil\nAbel\nin June\n1820\nhe was fully aware of his potential, writing\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nWith the most incredible genius he unites ardour for and interest in mathematics such that he quite probably, if he lives, shall become one of the great mathematicians.\nIt is interesting that Holmboe first wrote \"the world's greatest mathematician\", then replaced it with the more modest \"one of the great mathematicians\". It is also interesting to note that Holmboe was fully aware of\nAbel\n's health problems at this time. The relation between Holmboe and\nAbel\nwent well beyond one of teacher-pupil. The two became close friends but\nAbel\nalso got to know Holmboe's family, particularly three of his brothers: Christopher Andreas taught Hebrew at the University, Henrik Ancher worked in the chemistry laboratory at the University and Hans Peder took some of the same classes as\nAbel\n. He was invited to the Holmboe home in Eidsberg on a number of occasions, in particular spending a very happy time there at Christmas\n1821\n.\nHolmboe published the first volume of\nLaerebog i Mathematiken\nâ“‰\n(\nTextbook of mathematics\n)\nin\n1825\n. Two years later he published the second volume. These textbooks were based on Holmboe's highly successful teaching methods described above and were very successful being reprinted in different forms. Not everyone, of course, agreed with his ideas on teaching mathematics and between\n1835\nand\n1838\nChristopher Hansteen published textbooks for schools on geometry and mechanics. When the first of these texts appeared, Holmboe wrote a review for the newspaper\nMorgenbladet\nin which he advised schools not to use Hansteen's books; strong words to put in a review of work by a colleague. There followed a debate on mathematics teaching in schools which almost certainly was helpful in improving the way the subject was taught. It is worth recording that Holmboe's books have proved much more successful than those of Hansteen.\nIn\n1826\nHolmboe accepted a position as lecturer at the University of Christiania, a move which some have criticised since this might have been a possible post for\nAbel\n. The committee making the appointment to the lectureship did, however, consider both men for the position\n[\n2\n]\n:-\n... they considered that there were two men well-qualified for the position, Head Teacher B M Holmboe, and Student\nN H Abel\n. On Holmboe, the report stated that for many years now he had \"exhibited remarkable competence\" and showed an \"extensive and well-founded knowledge of mathematics.\" On\nAbel\n, it acknowledged his \"rare talent for mathematics and his great future in this science,\" but not was also taken of the fact that at this moment he had begun a lengthy journey abroad, that he could not easily be called back without harm, and that ... \"he would not with ease be able to adapt himself to the younger students' ability to conceptualise, and thus, not bear fruit in terms of lecturing in the elementary levels of mathematics ...\"\nAbel\ndid not seem to resent Holmboe's appointment in any way as he remained firm friends with him. From\n1826\nto\n1850\nHolmboe also lectured at the military academy in Christiania. In\n1834\nhe was appointed to the chair of pure mathematics at the University. During the years\n1828\n-\n30\nHolmboe lectured on astronomy since Hansteen was absent on a geomagnetic expedition to Siberia.\nOver six months after Abel's death in April\n1829\n, Holmboe's obituary of\nAbel\nwas published\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nHolmboe apologised for the obituary not appearing sooner, explaining that he had been abroad, the printing had been delayed, and that he had waited before writing to be sure that he could avail himself of the opinions of foreign mathematicians about\nAbel\n's importance and his achievements. Holmboe wanted his obituary to show\nAbel\n's incomparable gifts and contributions to mathematics and the admiration that this inspired in the great wide world.\nHowever, there is a puzzling aspect to this obituary which Stubhaug points out\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nHolmboe had been both teacher, friend and confidant to\nAbel\n. During\nAbel\n's grand tour it was Holmboe who most frequently received letters. One would have thought that Holmboe was the person most capable of explaining who Niels Henrik really was. But he did not want, did not manage, or perhaps thought it was unseemly, to say anything about how he saw and experienced\nNiels Henrik Abel\nin his full human dimensions. One possible explanation is that at that time one found a set of norms and traits of character that any respectable and educated man practised as a matter of course, and where nothing of an emotional nature was expressed; indeed, the fulfilment of these norms was taken for granted. In light of this attitude, Holmboe's rather bloodless obituary would not be surprising had it not been for the reactions of other\nAbel\nfriends.\nHolmboe, at the request of the Norwegian government, also edited\nAbel\n's complete works which appeared as\nOeuvres complÃ¨tes de N H Abel, mathÃ©maticien, avec des notes et dÃ©veloppements\nâ“‰\n(\nComplete Works of N H Abel, mathematician, with notes and developments\n)\n(\nChristiania,\n1839)\n. Many consider this his greatest mathematical contribution.\nOn\n14\nJune\n1834\n, Holmboe married Nikoline Antonie Finkenhagen on her thirtieth birthday. They had three daughters: Fredrikke Cathrine\n(\nborn\n1835)\n, Hanne Elisabeth\n(\nborn\n1836)\nand Nikoline Antonie\n(\nborn\n1839)\n, and a son who was stillborn. Hanne died at the age of two but the other two daughters lived full lives. Sadly Holmboe's wife died in\n1839\n, about two weeks after the birth of Nikoline Antonie. Holmboe married Ingeborg Cathrine Hannestad on\n15\nDecember\n1842\n; like his first wife she was thirty years old although the marriage was not on her birthday. Holmboe and Ingeborg had four children: Christopher Gotthard\n(\nborn\n1843)\n, twins Cathrine and Jens\n(\nborn\n1846)\n, and Olava Sophie\n(\nborn\n1849)\n. Only the twins reached adulthood, Christopher dying at age eleven and Olava dying at age five.\nHolmboe published\nStereometrie\nâ“‰\n(\nStereometry\n)\nin\n1833\n,\nPlan og sfaerisk Trigonometrie\nâ“‰\n(\nPlane and spherical trigonometry\n)\nin\n1834\n, and an advanced calculus book\nLaerebog i den hÃ¶iere mathematik\nâ“‰\n(\nTextbook of higher mathematics\n)\nin\n1849\n.\nÃ˜ystein Ore\nwrites that this\n[\n1\n]\n:-\n... advanced calculus text was evidently influenced by\nAbel\n's research.\nIn the later part of his career, Holmboe used his mathematical talents in the insurance industry. He had two separate involvements; from\n1832\nto\n1848\nhe was a member of the national body set up to supervise insurance companies, and from\n1847\nuntil his death he was a director of the insurance company Gjensidige.",
