  "biografia": "Umberto Puppini\nwas the son of Raffaele Puppini and Adele Rocchi. Raffaele Puppini was an assistant in electrical communications at the University of Bologna but tragically he died before his son Umberto was born. With no father to provide an income, the family would not have been able to afford to send the young Umberto to secondary school without financial support but, fortunately, he did receive support from the Saint Bartholomew orphanage.\nAfter graduating from high school, Puppini spent two years,\n1903\n-\n05\n, attending preparatory courses in the Faculty of Mathematical Sciences of the University of Bologna then, in\n1905\n, he entered the Royal Application School for Engineers in Bologna. Among his professors at this School was Luigi Donati\n(1846\n-\n1932)\n. Donati, born\n4\nApril\n1846\nin Fossombrone, had studied at the Scuola Normale Superiore and the University of Pisa before becoming a professor of physics at the Milan Polytechnic in\n1876\n. In the following year he moved to the University of Bologna where he taught mathematical physics. He was also a professor of technical and electrotechnical physics at the Royal Application School for Engineers in Bologna, where he became the director. Puppini graduated from the Royal Application School for Engineers in July\n1908\nwith distinction.\nLuigi Donati had been very impressed with his student so, after Puppini graduated, Donati appointed him as an assistant of technical physics and electrical engineering at the Institute of the University of Bologna. After four years at the Institute, Puppini was appointed in\n1912\nas an assistant in hydraulics working for Giovanni Cicali\n(1875\n-\n1952)\n. Cicali, born on\n25\nJuly\n1875\nin Montecatini Terme, studied engineering at the University of Pisa and then in Turin where he graduated in industrial engineering in\n1899\n. In\n1912\nhe became professor of thermal and hydraulic machines in the engineering faculty of the University of Bologna. Puppini became a\ndocent\nin hydraulics in\n1912\nand, starting in the following year, he was in charge of hydraulics teaching.\nIn\n1913\nPuppini published\nSui fondamenti scientici dell'Idraulica\nⓉ\n(\nOn the scientific foundations of hydraulics\n)\nwhere a reciprocity theorem for water flow in permeable rock is formulated, formally analogous to results in other areas of physics. This work led to him being awarded the Boileau prize from the\nParis Académie des Sciences\nin\n1915\n. The report to the\nAcademy\nputting forward the case for Puppini being awarded the prize was written by\nJoseph Valentin Boussinesq\n.\nOn\n22\nSeptember\n1913\nPuppini married Luisa Giordani; they had four children, Federica, Vittoria, Adele and Raffaele.\nWorld War I began in August\n1914\n. Italy had an alliance with Austria-Hungary and Germany but did not enter the war to support them. The Allies tried to convince Italy to join them with promises of giving Italy the Austrian South Tyrol. On\n23\nMay\n1915\nItaly declared war on Austria-Hungary. Puppini served as an artillery lieutenant. Warfare in the mountains of the Dolomites required engineering skills from both sides. Puppini served for ten months in\n1916\n-\n17\ninvolved in the construction of fighting tunnels which, as well as providing cover, led to better logistics support.\nAfter the war ended, Puppini returned to the University of Bologna where, in\n1920\n, he became an extraordinary professor of hydraulic engineering, being made a full professor in\n1924\n. He published\nAnalogie formali fra moti di acque filtranti e flussi di correnti elettriche\nⓉ\n(\nFormal analogies between motions of flowing waters and flows of electric currents\n)\nin\n1922\n. He then embarked on a political career, in parallel with his academic career.\nIn January\n1923\nhis name was on a list of candidates for the municipal council of Bologna. The list was supported by a committee from several parties, including the National Fascist Party. The list candidates received over\n40\n,\n000\nvotes in the elections and, in March\n1923\n, Puppini was elected mayor of Bologna\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nInitially reluctant to accept due to the fear of having to neglect academic commitments, he declared that he assumed the office in order to return to the city the good he had received, with specific reference to the institution through which he had been able to study.\nHe became a member of the National Fascist Party on\n2\nNovember\n1923\n.\nAs mayor, Puppini was able to allocate funds for projects which were close to his heart. For example, he launched a plan to urgently upgrade Bologna's sewers, roads and school buildings. Even more closely concerned with his academic interests, he wanted the municipal administration to fund the construction of new building for the Royal Application School for Engineers in Bologna. In May\n1924\nhe was able to inform the Council of Engineering Professors that the municipal administration would increase its funding for the University of Bologna\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nHis idea was to allocate funds especially to building works and the strengthening of scientific laboratories, while the director of the Application School for Engineers and municipal councillor Attilio Muggia would have preferred to assign the funding to the task of teaching.\nWe note that Attilio Muggia\n(1861\n-\n1936)\nattended the Application School for Engineers of Bologna where he graduated in\n1885\nas best pupil of his course. After graduating, he continued working at the School for Engineers, producing very high quality research and, between\n1923\nand\n1927\n, he was Director of the Application School for Engineers. We will return to Puppini's work supporting the University of Bologna as mayor but first let us note that Puppini was still actively working on fluid dynamics.\nThe International Congress of Mathematicians was held in Toronto, Canada, in August\n1924\n. Puppini attended the Congress, giving his affiliation as R Scuola di Ingegneria di Bologna, and representing the Associazione Elettrotecnica Italiana. He was one of the Chairmen of Section IV, Engineering, and gave two invited talks to this Section:\nLe Principe de Réciprocité dans les diverses branches de la physique\nⓉ\n(\nThe principle of reciprocity in the various branches of physics\n)\n; and\nAzioni sismiche sussultorie su montanti verticali incastrati alla base e con carichi e vincoli elastici all' estremo superiore\nⓉ\n(\nSeismic seizure actions on vertical uprights embedded at the base and with loads and elastic constraints at the upper end\n)\n.\nReturning to Puppini's time as mayor of Bologna, he wanted to support the University by awarding them a special\n25\nyear grant. He presented an outline of a plan for the renovation of the University, agreed by all relevant institutions, to the Ministry of Public Education in\n1926\n. The Italian Society for the Progress of Science held their\n15\nth conference in Bologna from\n30\nOctober to\n5\nNovember\n1926\nand the plan was presented to Benito Mussolini at the Conference where he delivered a speech.\nThe\n31\nst October was a festival of triumph for the Italian fascists when they celebrated the fourth anniversary of Mussolini's coup when he marched on Rome in\n1922\n. Mussolini was in Bologna and, of course, was being looked after by Mayor Puppini. Mussolini inaugurated the new sports stadium in the city, gave a speech to the Italian Society for the Progress of Science, and then after addressing a medical conference was driving down via Rizzoli in an Alfa Romeo with Puppini when a gunshot rang out. The bullet missed Mussolini and passed through Puppini's top hat which he was holding on his knees. The gun had been fired by\n15\nyear old Anteo Zamboni who was immediately set on and beaten to death by the crowd.\n[\nAlthough irrelevant to Puppini's biography, we note that some believe that Anteo Zamboni was not the person who fired the shot.\n]\nThe long dormant office of podestà for the head for the municipalities of Italy was revived by Mussolini in February\n1926\n. The office of mayor was abolished and, on\n26\nDecember\n1926\n, Puppini ceased to be mayor of Bologna; Leandro Arpinati assumed the office of podestà at this time. Puppini returned to teaching hydraulics at the Application School for Engineers and, in November\n1927\n, he was appointed as director of the School for Engineers when Attilio Muggia ended his time in that role. Puppini continued as director until\n1932\nand during that time he played an important role in getting the agreement for the renovation of the University of Bologna, which he had worked on as Mayor, put into law which happened on\n11\nApril\n1930\n.\nThe International Congress of Mathematicians took place in Bologna, Italy, in from\n3\nto\n10\nSeptember\n1928\n. Puppini, who gave his affiliation as Director of the Royal School of Engineering of Bologna, was an organiser and a plenary speaker at the Congress giving the lecture\nLe bonifiche in Italia\nⓉ\n(\nRenovation in Italy\n)\n. Puppini was a member of the Ordinary Committee and a member of the Executive Commission. He also represented the National Union of Fascist Engineers. To see a version of Puppini's plenary lecture, see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nAt the Congress, Puppini led the trip to Ferrara on Friday\n7\nSeptember. The report of this trip in the Proceedings of the Congress is as follows:-\nSeventy-eight members of the Congress participated in the trip to Ferrara, accompanied by Professor U Puppini, professor of hydraulics and director of the engineering school of Bologna, who guided them in the visit to the important work in progress in the basin of the Boicelli canal, which will have to connect the Po with the Ferrara dock, and of the grandiose aqueduct intended to supply water to the whole municipality of Ferrara, deriving it from the Po, by means of a very modern filtration and purification system. After the visit, the building company and the River Navigation Company offered lavish refreshments to the members of the Congress, who then, by means of numerous cars made available to them by the municipality of Ferrara, went to the city and were welcomed in the Castello Estense by the Vice-prefect and the President of the provincial deputation. They then visited the city monuments. At\n11\n.\n30\n, in the diamond palace, the Podestà of Ferrara, Mr Ravenna, addressed the members of the Congress welcoming them to Ferrara, recalling the glories of his university, which had the pride of hosting the immortal Copernicus. Professor U Puppini replied on behalf of the members of the Congress.\nPuppini was back in politics even while he served as director of the Royal School of Engineering. He had been elected to the Academy of Sciences of Bologna in\n1917\n, becoming a full member in\n1924\n. In February\n1929\nthe Academy of Sciences of Bologna nominated him to be put on the list for election to the Chamber of the Kingdom of Italy. In April\n1929\nhe was elected to the Chamber, serving as president of the parliamentary council for the budget from December\n1930\nto July\n1932\n.\nHe did find time to attend the International Congress of Mathematicians in Zurich in September\n1932\nbut at this Congress he did not present any lectures. Politics, however, was playing a large part in his life at this time\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nIn\n1931\n-\n32\nhe was a member of the Superior Council of Public Works. In July\n1932\nhe was appointed Undersecretary for Finance\n(\na position he held until April\n1934)\n: Minister Guido Jung entrusted him with some technical tasks such as supervision of the Land Registry, State Monopolies and State-owned assets\n(\nCanale Cavour, Salsomaggiore , Montecatini, Postumia, Taranto\n)\n. In his capacity as undersecretary, he also dealt with: relations with the Federal Institute of the Venetian regions and with some industrial companies; of technical and fiscal aspects of the road transport industry; with the Catasto\n(\nphotogrammetric surveys, technical revenue services, realisation of the Technical Review of the Cadastre\n)\n; with the consolidated text on surface and underground waters; with the electricity tax, and with expropriations for public utility. Finally he presided over the Commission for the regulation of local finance. In\n1934\n, on the occasion of the elections for the\n29\nth legislature, Puppini was again nominated by the Academy and elected to the Chamber of Deputies. At the end of April\n1934\nhe assumed the post of Minister of Communications: his mandate lasted nine months.\nOn\n25\nJanuary\n1935\nhe received a letter from Mussolini saying that he wished to end Puppini's role as Minister of Communications and asked him to take on the role as President of the General Italian Oil Company\n(\nAgip\n)\n. Puppini said later that his time as President of Agip had been one with many difficulties which had repercussions on his health. It appears that the many difficulties resulted from much corruption with people trying to take advantage, often in dishonest ways.\nOne of the tasks that Puppini had to deal with as president of Agip was taking a majority interest in the Mosul Oil Fields company which undertook research for oil fields in Iraq. In the summer of\n1935\nhe visited Iraq to personally coordinate the research programmes and, after returning to Italy in August, he sent a long report to Mussolini on the technical and financial questions connected with the development of a crude oil transport system from the promising fields of Qayara. There was a major shift when Mussolini sent his troops into East Africa invading Abyssinia and occupying Addis Ababa by May\n1936\n. The financial cost on Italy of the operation meant that Agip was forced to give up its shares in the Mosul Oil Fields.\nIn\n1937\nPuppini returned to his academic career by becoming dean of the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Bologna. This Faculty of Engineering was the Application School for Engineers under a new name. He once again concentrated on research, publishing papers such as:\nAlcune precisazioni sulla equazione del moto vario nelle correnti di acqua\nⓉ\n(\nSome clarifications on the equation of the various motions in water currents\n)\n(1938)\n;\nSull'uso della legge di similitudine nello studio della resistenza al moto delle navi\nⓉ\n(\nOn the use of the law of similitude in the study of the resistance to motion of ships\n)\n(1939)\n;\nCanale in parallelo lungo un tratto di corso d'acqua. Studio delle portate e dei profili di pelo libero\nⓉ\n(\nStudy of the capacities and the profiles of a canal in parallel with a stretch of a watercourse.\n)\n(1940)\n; and\nLa forma originaria del teorema di Daniel Bernoulli nell'idrodinamica\nⓉ\n(\nThe original form of Daniel Bernoulli's theorem in hydrodynamics\n)\n(1943)\n.\nIn\n[\n1\n]\n, it states that one of Puppini's great strengths in building up hydraulics in Bologna was his belief in the importance of mathematics. He had:-\n... an excellent knowledge of mathematics and the belief that the latter is indispensable for framing physical phenomena, to provide general and not just contingent solutions; and the fact of having a scientific culture not limited to its specific discipline, but with a very broad spectrum, so as to be able to grasp the many interesting analogies and possible synergies between different fields of knowledge ...\nGiambattista Scarpi notes that he\n[\n3\n]\n:-\n... was among the founders of the\nItalian Mathematical Union\n, President of the Institute for Applications of Calculus and of the National Research Council ...\nOne of his last tasks for the government was in\n1938\nwhen he was asked to advise on a project which was being pushed by Mussolini to build a seaplane base near Rome\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nIn\n1938\nhe was called to be part of a commission set up by the Ministry of Public Works with the task of making proposals for the regulation of the floods of the Tiber, in order to prevent damages such as those caused by the flood of December\n1937\n. The topic of water regulation was connected with the project - wanted by Mussolini himself and already partly funded by the ministry - of a large seaplane base and an airport to be built near the mouth of the river. Appointed as a hydraulics expert, Puppini judged the seaplane project \"absurd from a technical point of view and full of unknowns.\" ... Invited to express himself in the plenary assembly of the Superior Council of Public Works, he presented his criticisms, without however being able to prevent the approval of the project.\nDuring World War II, Puppini continued to undertake his research on fluid mechanics and kept out of politics. His Fascist connections and his working for Mussolini meant, however, that when the war ended he was suspended and his role was considered by a Commission set up to purge Fascists. Puppini presented a long and extremely detailed report to the Commission giving precise details of his role which he emphasised was 'technical' and not 'political'. He was reinstated as a full professor and restarted his teaching. This was cut short, however, on\n21\nMay\n1946\nwhen he suffered a heart attack in the middle of delivering a lecture to students. He died a few hours later at the St Orsola hospital in Bologna.\nGiambattista Scarpi writes\n[\n3\n]\n:-\nHe was a person of great moral rigour and honesty, a quality recognised even by those who did not share his political views. In this regard, I remember what Giulio Supino wrote about him in the obituary for the Bulletin of the\nItalian Mathematical Union\n: \"He also had numerous public offices and they were all held with that unquestionable rectitude and that scrupulous sense of duty that guided him throughout his life and which made him admired by his disciples and friends and respected by his opponents. The renunciation of sinecures that were usually sought by those who held those positions, the courageous demeanour at the Superior Council of Public Works against the construction of the Rome seaplane base, the opposition to the chimeric sufficiency of liquid fuels, within the National Council of Autarchia\n(\nAutarky\n)\n, are facts known and remembered by all.\nThe understand the full significance of the quote from Giulio Supino's obituary of Puppini, we note that Supino, one of Puppini's students and then a colleague, was a Jew who had lost his academic position under the Fascist racial laws.",
