  "biografia": "Li Shanlan\n's name is often written as\nLi Shan-lan.\nHe was the greatest Chinese mathematician of the\n19\nth\ncentury. He was born into a fairly important, highly educated, family from the Zhejiang province who employed a leading philologist, Chen Huan, to educate their children in the classics. Li had a brother, Li Xinmei who also became a fine mathematician.\nThere are two slightly different versions of how Li first came upon mathematics. One suggests that when he was eight years old he found a copy of the\nNine Chapters on the Mathematical Art\nin the library of a private school. He studied it on his own and mastered it without difficulty. The second version suggests that when Li was ten years old he studied the\nNine Chapters on the Mathematical Art\nunder his family tutor. It does seem certain then that he in love with mathematics through a study of the\nNine Chapters\n.\nIn\n1825\n, when he was fourteen years old, Li studied the first six books of Euclid's\nElements\nwhich had been translated into Chinese in\n1607\nby\nXu Guangqi\nand\nMatteo Ricci\n. He continued his studies of the classics and of mathematics and several years later travelled to Hangzhou to sit examinations. Although he failed the examinations the trip to Hangzhou was extremely valuable, for there he purchased two further mathematics texts. One was the\nCe yuan hai jing\nⓉ\n(\nSea mirror of circle measurements\n)\n, originally written by\nLi Zhi\nin\n1248\n, which was of fundamental importance in the development of Chinese algebra. The other was\nGougu geyuan ji\nⓉ\n(\nRecord of measuring segments of a circle\n)\nwhich was a trigonometry text written by Dai Zhen, who is famous as an editor of the\nNine Chapters\non the Mathematical Art\n, and had been appointed as an editor for compiling an encyclopaedia of knowledge by the Emperor Qianlong in\n1773\n.\nThe \"tian yuan\" or \"coefficient array method\" or \"method of the celestial unknown\" of setting up equations, which Li learnt from\nLi Zhi\n's famous text, had a huge influence on him and he began to push these algebraic techniques forward solving a whole variety of new problems. Although he had been largely self educated in mathematics, Li now made contact with others having the same interests. He wanted to make a career for himself in mathematics but at this time in China the subject was not considered of sufficient importance that one could make a living as a professional mathematician. The best way for a scholar to earn his living, yet have sufficient time to push forward his research, was to be employed as a private tutor. This is the route Li was forced to take and he was fortunate to be employed in\n1845\nby a family who had a deep love of education. He now moved in circles which included others with similar interests in mathematics to his own and exchanging ideas proved fruitful as he pushed forward his research.\nWe have not yet referred in this article to the political situation in China during Li's life. This is because up until about\n1850\nit had relatively little impact on him. It had been a time of wars in China, however, for in\n1841\nBritish warships had arrived in Hong Kong and a war broke out. The reasons were complex and relate to the huge profits that the British were getting through the opium trade, while the Chinese government was trying to stop Chinese use of the drug. The British claimed that they were supporting the Chinese people against their leaders\n(\nalways a good policy!\n)\n. Certainly the Chinese government had not been popular and after this its prestige declined further. The Taiping Rebellion began in\n1850\nwhen a religious group based on Christianity began to gain huge support. Well organised militarily, they made gains defeating the Imperial army in April\n1852\n. Li looked to avoid getting caught up in the Taiping Rebellion and, in\n1852\n, he went to Shanghai which looked safe.\nFrom a scientific prospective the move to Shanghai was very significant for Li since there he met with Protestant missionaries from the London Missionary Society, and in particular he met Alexander Wylie. He would remain there for eight years working with these missionaries translating Western science works into classical Chinese. With Alexander Wylie, Li translated\nElements of Analytical Geometry and of the Differential and Integral Calculus\nwhich had been written by Elias Loomis and published in New York in\n1851\n. Their Chinese translation was published in\n1859\nand became the first book to introduce\nNewton\n's calculus into China. The following quotation is from the Preface to the treatise:-\nAlthough this is the first time that the principles of\nalgebraic geometry\nhave been placed before the Chinese, in their own idiom, yet there is little doubt that this branch of the science will commend itself to native mathematicians, in consideration of its obvious utility ... A spirit of enquiry is abroad among the Chinese, and there is a class of students, by no means small in number, who receive with avidity instruction on scientific matters from the West.\nLi also worked with the protestant missionary Joseph Edkins on a translation of\nW Whewell\n's\nAn elementary treatise on mechanics\n. It was not published until several years after the translation was made, finally being published under the title\nZhongxue\nⓉ\n(\nMiddle school\n)\nin\n1867\n. It was the first introduction of Newtonian mechanics into China. Another major translation which Li undertook with Alexander Wylie was the translation of the final nine books of\nEuclid\n's\nElements\n. These were translated from\nIsaac Barrow\n's edition.\nOther mathematics books translated by Li include\nDe Morgan\n's\nElements of algebra\nbut Li did not just translate mathematics book, however, for with Alexander Williamson and Joseph Edkins he translated John Lindley's\nBotany\n. The translation appeared in\n1858\n. He also translated\nJohn Herschel\n's\nOutlines of astronomy\n.\nFor eight years Li worked with the missionaries of the London Missionary Society in Shanghai. During this period the Taiping Rebellion had at first had great success with the capture of Nanking in\n1853\n. However, internal conflicts between those who led the rebellion weaken it but in\n1860\nthey tried to re-establish their progress and take Shanghai but the attempt failed. Li left Shanghai, probably before the attack on the city, and moved to join the staff of Xu Youren who was Governor of Jiangsu province. Xu may have been a governor but he was also an excellent mathematician with an interest in infinite series. Li worked for him for three years and then he was approached by Zeng Guofan and his younger brother Zeng Guoquan who asked him to work for them. The Zeng brothers were both scholars and army generals, and in the latter capacity they had gained a strong reputation for the suppressing the Taiping Rebellion. They financially supported the publication of Li's complete mathematical works which were published in Nanking in\n1867\n.\nLi was recommended to the newly established T'ung-wen-kuan\n(\nCollege of combined learning\n)\nin\n1864\n. The T'ung-wen-kuan had opened in Peking in the previous year as an initiative of the Chinese government who aimed to train Chinese students in foreign languages so they might gain Western knowledge more easily. However Li did not take up the appointment until\n1866\nfor he did not wish to be part of a translating school. However the government realised the importance of mathematics in the development of the country and in\n1868\nthe T'ung wen-kuan was upgraded to a college and a department of mathematics and astronomy was added. After this, in July\n1869\n, Li was happy to accept the position of Professor of Mathematics. There, Li worked with William A P Martin\n(1827\n-\n1916)\n, who served as president of the college from the time of its upgrading in\n1869\nuntil\n1882\n, teaching mathematics and preparing translations of scientific works. The College offered students the choice between two courses. There was an eight year degree course which contained the study of foreign languages and Western sciences. There was also a shorter five year degree course which combined traditional Chinese mathematics with a study of European sciences. For example the first of the five years was spent on a study of the\nNine Chapters\non the\nMathematical Art\n. By their fourth year students were studying the differential and integral calculus.\nAlthough Li Shanlan is important as a translator of Western science texts, it is not in this capacity that he is most famous. Rather his fame rests on his mathematical contributions. These were remarkable in that although he became familiar with Western mathematics he actually based his research on ancient Chinese mathematics. He produced his own versions of logarithms, infinite series, and combinatorics but he did not follow the style of western mathematics but made his research naturally develop out of the foundations of Chinese mathematics. One has to praise him very highly for this approach for his neither threw away the heritage of Chinese mathematics nor did he live in the past by ignoring the progress which had been made in the West.\nLet us give an example to illustrate the points we have just made. Li wrote\nDuoji bilei\nⓉ\n(\nSumming finite series\n)\n(\npublished in\n1867\nas part of his collected works\n)\nwhere, in Chapter\n4\n, he gave fascinating formulae relating binomial coefficients,\nStirling\nnumbers, Eulerian numbers and many others. He writes in the Preface to Chapter\n4\n:-\nThe summation of series constitutes a branch of Chinese mathematics called Short Width\n[\nChapter\n4\nof the\nNine Chapters on the Mathematical Art\n. The works of the great astronomer\nGuo Shoujing\nconcerning the inequalities of the solar and lunar motion, Wang Lai's iterated sums, Dong Fangli's cyclotomical computations, and lastly the summation of series which appear in the algebra and the differential calculus of the Westerners constitute the major part of this chapter. The usefulness of the mathematical techniques contained is indeed multifarious. None the less, mathematical books seldom deal directly with these.\nZhu Shijie\nfrom the Yuan dynasty is the only one who has made use of the prescriptions relating to summation of series. ... But his intention was only to expound the algebra and for that reason he presents the summation of series neither precisely nor methodically.\nBoth\n[\n5\n]\n,\n[\n2\n]\nand\n[\n3\n]\ndiscuss some of the wonderful summation formulae that Li discovered. For example in\n[\n3\n]\nLi's method of writing the sum of the\np\np\np\nth powers of the first\nn\nn\nn\nnatural numbers as sums of binomial coefficients is given. His use of a generalised version of\nPascal's triangle\nis also explained.\nLi worked out his own form of integration to compute volumes. The following quotation from\nFang yuan chanyou\nⓉ\n(\nDiscussion of the theory of squares and circles\n)\n(\npublished in\n1867\nas part of his collected works\n)\nshows how he thought:-\nA book one chi thick is made up of sheets of paper, whereas taffeta one zhang long is made up of threads of silk.\nLi also wrote on prime numbers.",
