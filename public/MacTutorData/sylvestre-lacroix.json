  "biografia": "Sylvestre Lacroix\n's parents were poor but he still managed to obtain a good education. He was brought up in Paris which gave him access to good schools. He studied at the Collège des Quatre Nations in Paris where he was taught mathematics by the Abbé Joseph François Marie. When he was only\n14\nyears old he spent many happy hours engrossed in making lengthy calculations of the motion of the planets. In the following year he had the opportunity to further his studies in mathematics by attending a free course given by\nMonge\n.\nAt this time\nMonge\nwas officially employed at the École at Mézières but he had been elected to the\nAcadémie des Sciences\nin Paris in\n1780\nand began to spend most of his time there teaching courses such as the one that Lacroix attended. Lacroix was fortunate to be a student of\nMonge\nwho soon realised that his young pupil had an outstanding talent for mathematics and he used his influence to help him develop his career.\nMonge\nhad replaced\nBézout\nas examiner of naval cadets and this post put him in a position where he could recommend that Lacroix be appointed as Professor of Mathematics at the École Gardes de Marine at Rochefort in\n1782\n. Not only did\nMonge\nuse his influence to obtain this position for Lacroix, but he also acted as his mathematical advisor, recommending that he undertake research on partial differential equations and the calculus of variations. Lacroix followed his advice and in\n1785\n, when still only twenty years old, he sent a memoir to\nMonge\nwho presented it to the\nAcadémie des Sciences\n. Lacroix had maintained his early interest in calculating astronomical data, and in the same year he sent his new solar tables to the Academy.\nFrom Rochefort, Lacroix returned to Paris.\nCondorcet\nwas at this time serving as Permanent Secretary to the\nAcadémie des Sciences\n, Inspector General of the Mint, and undertaking a great deal of work on political economy where he applied probability and the philosophy of mathematics. As was common practice at that time he kept his position teaching mathematics at the Lycée but appointed a substitute to do the teaching for him. It was this position which allowed Lacroix to return to teach in Paris but the pure mathematics course at this newly opened school, which attracted most of its students from the nobility, was poorly attended and soon discontinued. Lacroix continued to teach astronomy and the\ntheory of probability\nat the Lycée. Around this time he married.\nThe\nAcademy of Sciences\nproposed the topic of its Grand Prix for\n1787\nto be on the theory of marine insurance, and Lacroix submitted an entry. He was judged as joint winner of the prize, but never received it. He took on a further position in February\n1787\n, again as a substitute, this time at the École Militaire in Paris where he took over the duties of the professor of mathematics Le Paute d'Agelot who had left with the navigator La Pérouse on his ill-fated explorations in the Pacific Ocean. Soon he was appointed to the chair at the École Militaire, rather than as a substitute for the professor, but these were uncertain times and his position at the Lycée was abolished in August\n1787\nwhile in March\n1788\nthe École was closed. Lacroix moved again to the provinces.\nThis time Lacroix went to Besançon where he was appointed as Professor of Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry at the École d'Artillerie. However the\nAcademy of Sciences\nchose him as\nCondorcet\n's correspondent on\n29\nAugust\n1789\n, but the situation in France had already started to become chaotic. The French Revolution began with the storming of the Bastille on\n14\nJuly\n1789\nand after the Reign of Terror commenced in\n1793\nthe\nAcademy of Sciences\n, along with the other learned societies, was abolished on\n8\nAugust.\nLaplace\nhad been an examiner at the Royal Artillery Corps since\n1784\n, but before the Reign of Terror he left Paris with his family. Lacroix was appointed to succeed him as examiner at the Artillery Corps on\n1\nOctober\n1793\n.\nMonge\nhad been appointed by the National Convention on\n11\nMarch\n1794\nto the body that was put in place to establish the École Centrale des Travaux Publics\n(\nsoon to be called the École Polytechnique\n)\n, and he was appointed to teach a course in descriptive geometry on\n9\nNovember\n1794\n. Lacroix and\nHachette\nassisted\nMonge\nin the work for his descriptive geometry course. Lacroix was particularly well suited to assist with this course since he had been assembling material on descriptive geometry for several years, and he went on to publish\nEléments de géométrie déscriptive\n. He was appointed to a chair at the École Centrale des Quatres Nations, then was appointed professor of mathematics at the École Polytechnique from\n1799\nwhere he held the chair of analysis.\nThe National Convention ratified the creation of the Institut National des Sciences et des Arts on\n22\nAugust\n1795\n. The First Class of the Institute was Science with\n60\nmembers divided into ten sections with six members each\n(\neffectively the old\nAcademy of Sciences\n)\n. On\n20\nMay\n1799\nLacroix was elected a member of the Institut, becoming one of the six in the mathematics section on the death of\nBorda\n. He also became a professor at the École Polytechnique in\n1809\n, filling\nLagrange\n's chair, and a professor of differential calculus at the Faculté des Sciences in\n1810\n. In\n1815\nhe left the École Polytechnique to take up a chair at the Sorbonne and he was appointed to the chair of mathematics at the Collège de France where he had taught since\n1812\n.\nLacroix was the writer of important textbooks in mathematics and through these he made a major contribution to the teaching of mathematics throughout France and also in other countries. He published a two volume text\nTraité de calcul differéntiel et du calcul intégral\nⓉ\n(\nTreatise on differential and integral calculus\n)\n(1797\n-\n1798)\nwhich is perhaps his most famous work. In the first of these volumes Lacroix introduces for the first time the expression \"analyic geometry\" writing:-\nThere exists a manner of viewing geometry that could be called géométrie analytique, and which would consist in deducing the properties of extension from the least possible number of principles, and by truly analytic methods.\nHe expanded his masterpiece to three volumes for the second edition published between\n1810\nand\n1819\n. Itard writes in\n[\n1\n]\nthat this:-\n... monumental work consisted a clear picture of mathematical analysis, documented and completely up to date.\nLacroix wrote many excellent textbooks to support his lectures, for example\nTraité élémentaire de calcul differéntiel et du calcul intégral\nⓉ\n(\nElementary treatise on differential calculus and integral calculus\n)\nwhich was published in\n1802\n. Other texts included\nTraité élémentaire d'arithmétique\nⓉ\n(\nElementary treatise on arithmetic\n)\n(1797)\n,\nTraité élémentaire de trigonométrie\nⓉ\n(\nElementary treatise on trigonometry\n)\n(1798)\n,\nElémens de géométrie\nⓉ\n(\nElements of geometry\n)\n(1799)\n, and\nComplément des élémens d'algèbre\nⓉ\n(\nSupplement to 'Elements of geometry'\n)\n(1800)\n. Of the geometry texts of Lacroix and\nLagrange\n, Lamandé writes in\n[\n5\n]\n:-\nSupported by the new educational institutions, these works left a mark on their epoch. The authors, breaking with the intuitionism that had dominated eighteenth-century French treatises, updated the logic of geometry manuals. Although they did not take up the Eudoxian theory of the \"Elements\", they brought a new rigor to the theory of proportions. The efforts of Lacroix and\nLegendre\nto expose or recast the theory of parallels were notable, as were their additions to the theory. These works illustrate the different paths that had opened for the teaching of geometry: the return to the Ancients or the rewriting and expansion of that material from an analytic or synthetic perspective.\nAs we mentioned above Lacroix's texts had an influence beyond France, see for example\n[\n3\n]\n, and it was through English translations of\nTraité élémentaire de calcul differéntiel et du calcul intégral\nⓉ\n(\nElementary treatise on differential calculus and integral calculus\n)\nby\nBabbage\n,\nPeacock\nand\nHerschel\nthat the 'new continental mathematics' entered universities in Britain.\nIt is interesting that Lacroix held the view that algebra and geometry:-\n... should be treated separately, as far apart as they can be, and that the results in each should serve for mutual clarification, corresponding, so to speak, to the text of a book and its translation.\nHis texts appeared in many editions for over\n50\nyears and in\n[\n6\n]\nSchubring describes how the changes in the successive editions during these\n50\nyears, and their influence on the educational system, relate to the history of mathematical education.",
