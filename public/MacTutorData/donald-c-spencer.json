  "biografia": "Donald C Spencer\n's parents were Frank Robert Spencer and Edith Clayton. He was an undergraduate at the University of Colorado, receiving a B.A. in\n1934\n, before moving to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology where he studied aeronautical engineering and was awarded a B.S. in\n1936\n. Spencer married Mary J Halley on\n25\nJuly\n1936\n; they had two children Maredith and Marianne. After his marriage he went to England to undertake studies for his doctorate at the University of Cambridge. His thesis advisor was\nJ E Littlewood\n, but he was also greatly influenced at this time by\nG H Hardy\n. Spencer worked on\nanalytic number theory\nand submitted his doctoral dissertation\nOn a Hardy-Littlewood Problem of Diophantine Approximation\nin\n1939\n.\nAfter returning to the United States, Spencer was appointed as an Instructor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in\n1939\n. He remained there until\n1942\nworking mainly on functions of one complex variable. However he retained his interest in analytic number theory which he had worked on at Cambridge, and he published two important papers in\n1942\n, both joint with\nR Salem\nwho had been appointed to MIT in\n1941\n. These papers were\nThe influence of gaps on density of integers\nand\nOn sets of integers which contain no three terms in arithmetical progression\n. In the first of these they proved that a progression-free sequence of positive integers never has positive density. Although Spencer's interests moved to other areas of mathematics the problems studied in these papers were of fundamental importance in progress by other mathematicians extending over many years.\nIn\n1942\nSpencer moved to Stanford University where he was appointed as an associate professor. Of course by this time the United States had entered World War II and Spencer went to New York University to work with the Applied Mathematics Group during\n1944\n-\n45\nas part of the war effort. There he was influenced by\nCourant\nand Spencer's work took a new direction, applying variational methods to the coefficient problem for univalent functions. In\n1946\nSpencer was promoted to a full professorship at Stanford and he remained there until\n1950\nwhen he accepted the position of associate professor at Princeton University. After his first marriage ended in divorce, Spencer married Natalie Robertson Sanborn on\n7\nJuly\n1951\n; they had one son Donald Clayton. Spencer was promoted to full professor at Princeton in\n1953\n, holding this position for ten years. During this period he spent the year\n1954\n-\n1955\nat the Collège de France supported by a Fulbright grant for study and lecturing. In\n1963\nhe left Princeton and returned to Stanford University but, after five years, returned again to Princeton. He was named Eugene Higgins Professor of Mathematics at Princeton in\n1971\n, and then\nHenry Burchard Fine\nProfessor of Mathematics. He held this latter chair until he retired in\n1978\nwhen Princeton made him\nHenry Burchard Fine\nProfessor of Mathematics, emeritus.\nSpencer's work in the late\n1940\ns and early\n1950\nwas on the theory of the conformal mapping of plane regions in which domain functions, variational methods, and the problem of coefficient domains are central considerations. He worked with\nM Schiffer\nand A C Schaeffer on these topics and the\nAmerican Mathematical Society\nawarded its\nBôcher\nMemorial Prize for\n1948\nto Schaeffer and Spencer:-\n... for their memoir \"Coefficients of schlicht functions. I, II, III, IV\".\nThis led to Spencer's most famous collaboration, namely that with\nKunihiko Kodaira\non the deformations of complex manifolds. J J Kohn writes\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nSpencer's work with\nKodaira\nwas one of the most remarkable mathematical collaborations of the twentieth century: its only parallel is the famous\nHardy\n-\nLittlewood\nwork.\nIt may be worth contemplating how much Spencer's doctoral work with\nLittlewood\nand\nHardy\nwas significant here.\nLet us quote from\nKodaira\n, writing in the Preface of\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nIn order to clarify this mystery, Spencer and I developed the theory of deformations of compact complex manifolds. the process of the development was the most interesting experience in my whole mathematical life. It was similar to an experimental science developed by the interaction experiments\n(\nexamination of examples\n)\nand theory. In this book I have tried to reproduce this interesting experience; however I could not fully convey it. Such an experience may be a passing phenomenon which cannot be reproduced.\nIn\n1959\nSpencer, along with H K Nickerson and\nN E Steenrod\n, pubished the textbook\nAdvanced calculus\n. A J Lohwater begins a review:-\nThe contents of this remarkable book have served as notes for a special course in advanced calculus at Princeton University. The book stems from a widespread dissatisfaction with the method of presentation of the subject matter of the traditional course in advanced calculus and succeeds in showing that the traditional subject matter can form an integral part of modern mathematics.\nIn\n1989\nSpencer received the President's National Medal of Science. The medal was presented to Spencer by President Bush at a White House Ceremony on\n18\nOctober\n1989\n:-\nFor his original and insightful research that has had a profound impact on twentieth-century mathematics, and for his role as an inspiring teacher to generations of American mathematicians.\nKodaira\nhad written to the President's Committee two years earlier in support of the award of the medal to Spencer:-\nSpencer's contributions to mathematics go far beyond his published papers. He exerted tremendous influence on his collaborators and students. His enthusiasm knew no limit and was contagious. In Princeton he was always surrounded by a group of mathematicians who shared his enthusiasm and collaborated in the research of complex analysis\n(\nI was one of them\n)\n. In the\n1950\ns the theory of complex manifolds was developed extensively in Princeton. The driving force behind this development was in fact Spencer's enthusiasm.\nIn addition to the honours mentioned above we note that Spencer was elected to the\nNational Academy of Sciences\nin\n1961\nand to the\nAmerican Academy of Arts and Sciences\nin\n1967\n. He was Colloquium Lecturer of the\nAmerican Mathematical Society\nat its Summer meeting of\n1968\n. In addition he received the George Norlin Award from the University of Colorado in\n1990\n.\nSpencer served on the editorial boards of several journals. He was a member of Editorial Board of the\nTransactions of the American Mathematical Society\n(1950\n-\n1955)\n, the\nAnnals of Mathematics\n(1958\n-\n1962)\n, the\nProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences\n(1965\n-\n1967)\n, the\nAmerican Journal of Mathematics\n(1967\n-\n1975)\n, and the\nJournal of Differential Geometry\n(1967\n-\n1981)\n.\nJ J Kohn writes\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nIn\n1978\nSpencer retired from Princeton and moved to Durango, Colorado. There he became very active in the conservation and ecology movements and also an avid hiker. he soon made many friends and became well known in the area. The city of Durango designated April\n25\nas \"Don Spencer Day\".\nAfter his death, a mountain peak outside of Silverton, Colorado was named in his honour.",
