  "summary": "Pietro Cataldi was an Italian mathematician who wrote around 30 books on mathematics, and some on other topics.",
  "biografia": "Pietro Cataldi\n's father was Paolo Cataldi who, like his son, was born in Bologna. Pietro was educated in Bologna although he does not seem to have attended the university there; rather he began teaching mathematics at the age of seventeen. Note that of particular significance is the fact that he chose to teach in the local dialect of Italian rather than in Latin as was the custom in those days. This enabled many people to benefit from his teaching. He taught in Florence in the Academy of Design from\n1569\nuntil\n1570\nthen he went to Perugia, in Umbria in central Italy. He taught mathematics both at the University of Perugia, giving his first lecture on\n12\nMay\n1572\n, and also at the Academy of Design in Perugia. He remained there until\n1584\nand then returned to Bologna where he was awarded a doctorate in philosophy and in medicine. He taught mathematics and astronomy at the Studio di Bologna for almost forty years until his death.\nCataldi wrote around thirty books on mathematics, and some on other topics. He wrote on arithmetic publishing\nPractica aritmetica\nⓉ\n(\nPractical arithmetic\n)\nin four parts between\n1602\nand\n1617\n. This work was dedicated to the Senate of Bologna, but it is believed that he published it at his own expense. Carruccio writes\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nCataldi showed his benevolence by giving the superiors of various Franciscan monasteries the task of distributiong free copies of his 'Practica aritmetica' to monasteries, seminaries, and poor children.\nHe is, however, best known for his work on\nperfect numbers\nand on\ncontinued fractions\n. His contributions to perfect numbers were made in\n1603\n.\nEuclid\nknew that if\n2\nn\n−\n1\n2^{n} - 1\n2\nn\n−\n1\nis prime, then\n2\nn\n−\n1\n(\n2\nn\n−\n1\n)\n2^{n-1}( 2^{n} - 1)\n2\nn\n−\n1\n(\n2\nn\n−\n1\n)\nis a perfect number. This gives the perfect numbers\n6\n,\n28\n,\n496\nand\n8128\nby taking\nn\nn\nn\n=\n2\n,\n3\n,\n5\n,\n7\nrespectively. These were known to the ancient Greeks, and the next perfect number had been found in\n1536\nby Hudalrichus Regius who showed that\n2\n13\n−\n1\n2^{13} - 1\n2\n1\n3\n−\n1\nis prime giving\n33350336\nas the next perfect number\n(\nthis had been discovered earlier by a number of mathematicians but their discoveries only became common knowledge comparatively recently\n)\n. Cataldi, in\n1603\n, showed that if\nn\nn\nn\nis composite then\n2\nn\n−\n1\n2^{n} - 1\n2\nn\n−\n1\nis composite, and he also showed that\n2\nn\n−\n1\n2^{n} - 1\n2\nn\n−\n1\nis prime for\nn\n=\n17\nn = 17\nn\n=\n1\n7\nand\nn\n=\n19\nn = 19\nn\n=\n1\n9\n. He used no clever tricks, merely checked that these numbers were prime by dividing each by all primes up to their square roots. Of course, to do this he required a list of primes up to\n724\n(\nthe approximate root of\n2\n19\n−\n1\n2^{19} - 1\n2\n1\n9\n−\n1\n)\n. In fact Cataldi calculated a list of all primes up to\n750\nand a list of the factorisation of all numbers up to\n800\n. He published these lists separately. By showing that\n2\n17\n−\n1\n=\n131071\n2^{17} - 1 = 131071\n2\n1\n7\n−\n1\n=\n1\n3\n1\n0\n7\n1\nand\n2\n19\n−\n1\n=\n524287\n2^{19} - 1 = 524287\n2\n1\n9\n−\n1\n=\n5\n2\n4\n2\n8\n7\nwere prime, Cataldi had, in fact, found the sixth and seventh perfect numbers\n8589869056\nand\n137438691328\n. He also conjectured that\n2\nn\n−\n1\n2^{n} - 1\n2\nn\n−\n1\nwas prime for\nn\nn\nn\n=\n23\n,\n29\n,\n31\nand\n37\nbut all of these turned out to be false except for\nn\nn\nn\n=\n31\n.\nFermat\nshowed that\n2\n23\n−\n1\n=\n8388607\n=\n47\n×\n178481\n2^{23} - 1 = 8388607 = 47 \\times  178481\n2\n2\n3\n−\n1\n=\n8\n3\n8\n8\n6\n0\n7\n=\n4\n7\n×\n1\n7\n8\n4\n8\n1\nand\n2\n37\n−\n1\n=\n137438953471\n=\n223\n×\n616318177\n)\n2^{37} - 1 = 137438953471 = 223 \\times  616318177)\n2\n3\n7\n−\n1\n=\n1\n3\n7\n4\n3\n8\n9\n5\n3\n4\n7\n1\n=\n2\n2\n3\n×\n6\n1\n6\n3\n1\n8\n1\n7\n7\n)\nwere composite in\n1640\n.\nEuler\nshowed that\n2\n31\n−\n1\n2^{31} - 1\n2\n3\n1\n−\n1\nwas prime in\n1732\n; it gave rise to the first discovery of a perfect number since those of Cataldi about\n130\nyears earlier.\nEuler\nalso disproved the last part of Cataldi's conjecture in\n1738\nwhen he showed that\n2\n29\n−\n1\n=\n536870911\n=\n233\n×\n1103\n×\n2089\n2^{29} - 1 = 536870911 = 233 \\times  1103 \\times  2089\n2\n2\n9\n−\n1\n=\n5\n3\n6\n8\n7\n0\n9\n1\n1\n=\n2\n3\n3\n×\n1\n1\n0\n3\n×\n2\n0\n8\n9\nis composite.\nCataldi found square roots of numbers by use of an infinite series leading to an early investigation into continued fractions. This work on continued fractions appears in\nTrattato del modo brevissimo di trovar la radice quadra delli numeri\nⓉ\n(\nTreatise on a very short way of finding the square root of numbers\n)\n(1613)\nalthough he announced them in\nOperetta delle linee rette equidistanti et non equidistanti\nⓉ\n(\nA work on  equidistant and non-equidistant straight lines\n)\n(1603)\n. His methods make precise some ideas which went back to\nHeron\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nIn this work the square root of a number is found through the use of infinite series and unlimited continued fractions. It represents a notable contribution to the development of infinite algorithms.\nCataldi calculates the square root of a number\nN\nN\nN\nby first taking the integer a such that\na\n2\n<\nN\n<\n(\na\n+\n1\n)\n2\na^{2} < N < (a+1)^{2}\na\n2\n<\nN\n<\n(\na\n+\n1\n)\n2\n.

We note that he does not use what are called today 'simple continued fractions' and his method will always give a continued fraction for a square root which has period\n1\n. He writes:-\nLet us now proceed to the consideration of another method of finding roots continuing by adding row on row to the denominator of the fraction of the preceding rule. But for greater convenience, I shall assume a number whose root may be easily taken and I shall assume that the first part of the root is an integer. Then let\n18\nbe the proposed number, and if I assume that the first root is\n4\n2\n8\n4 \\large\\frac{2}{8}\\normalsize\n4\n8\n2\n​\n, that is\n4\n1\n4\n4\\large\\frac{1}{4}\\normalsize\n4\n4\n1\n​\n, this will be in excess by\n1\n16\n\\large\\frac{1}{16}\\normalsize\n1\n6\n1\n​\nwhich is the square of the fraction\n1\n4\n\\large\\frac{1}{4}\\normalsize\n4\n1\n​\n.\nHere the\n4\n2\n8\n4\\large\\frac{2}{8}\\normalsize\n4\n8\n2\n​\nis\na\n1\na_{1}\na\n1\n​\nand the excess of\n1\n16\n\\large\\frac{1}{16}\\normalsize\n1\n6\n1\n​\nis\nr\n1\nr_{1}\nr\n1\n​\n. The first convergent is therefore\n17\n4\n\\large\\frac{17}{4}\\normalsize\n4\n1\n7\n​\n. He finds\nx\nx\nx\nsuch that\n4\n2\n(\n8\n+\nx\n)\n4\\large\\frac{2}{(8+x)}\\normalsize\n4\n(\n8\n+\nx\n)\n2\n​\nhas a rounded minimum value of √\n18\nwhich he observes is when\n(\nand only when\n)\na\n+\nx\na + x\na\n+\nx\nhas a rounded minimum value of √\n18\n, so\nx\n=\n2\n8\nx = \\large\\frac{2}{8}\\normalsize\nx\n=\n8\n2\n​\n. Cataldi continues:-\nThe second root will be found by the above mentioned method to be\n4\n. &\n2\n8\n\\large\\frac{2}{8}\\normalsize\n8\n2\n​\n. &\n1\n4\n\\large\\frac{1}{4}\\normalsize\n4\n1\n​\nwhich is\n4.\n4.\n4\n.\n&\n8\n33\n\\large\\frac{8}{33}\\normalsize\n3\n3\n8\n​\n, which is\n2\n1089\n\\large\\frac{2}{1089}\\normalsize\n1\n0\n8\n9\n2\n​\ntoo small.

Cataldi continues to calculate the third convergent to be\n577\n136\n\\large\\frac{577}{136}\\normalsize\n1\n3\n6\n5\n7\n7\n​\n. He then computes\n(\n577\n136\n)\n2\n−\n18\n=\n1\n18496\n(\\large\\frac{577}{136}\\normalsize )^{2}-18 = \\large\\frac{1}{18496}\\normalsize\n(\n1\n3\n6\n5\n7\n7\n​\n)\n2\n−\n1\n8\n=\n1\n8\n4\n9\n6\n1\n​\nand states that the third convergent is too large by\n11\n18496\n\\large\\frac{11}{18496}\\normalsize\n1\n8\n4\n9\n6\n1\n1\n​\n. He continues the calculation until he reaches the fifteenth convergent. Note that the third convergent gives √\n18\ncorrect to\n5\ndecimal places, and the fifteenth convergent\n886731088897\n209004522016\n\\large\\frac{886731088897}{209004522016}\\normalsize\n2\n0\n9\n0\n0\n4\n5\n2\n2\n0\n1\n6\n8\n8\n6\n7\n3\n1\n0\n8\n8\n8\n9\n7\n​\ngives √\n18\ncorrect to\n23\ndecimal places.

In\n1618\nhe published\nOperetta di ordinanze quadre\nⓉ\n(\nWork on square ordinances\n)\nwhich studied military applications of algebra. In\n1612\nhe published a book on squaring the circle\nTrattato della quadratura del cerchio dove si esamina un nuovo modo di quadrarlo per numeri. Et insieme si mostra come, Dato un rettilineo, si formi un curvilineo equale ad esso Dato. Et di più alcune transformationi di curvilinei misti fra loro\nⓉ\n(\nTreatise on the squaring of the circle where a new way of squaring it by numbers is examined. And at the same time it is shown how, given a straight line, a curve equal to it is formed. And also some transformations of curvilinear lines mixed together\n)\n. Cataldi begins this work with a commentary on a recently published work on the same topic, namely Pellegrino Borello's\nRegola e modo facilissimo di quadrare il cerchio\nⓉ\n(\nA rule and a very easy way to square the circle\n)\n(1609)\n.\nAugustus De Morgan\nwrites in\nA Budget of paradoxes\n:-\n[\nTrattato della quadratura del cerchio by Pietro Antonio Cataldi. Bologna,\n1612]\nclaims a place as beginning with the quadrature of Pellegrino Borello of Reggio, who will have the circle to be exactly\n3\ndiameters and\n69\n484\n\\large\\frac{69}{484}\\normalsize\n4\n8\n4\n6\n9\n​\nof a diameter. Cataldi, taking Van Ceulen's approximation, works hard at the finding of integers which nearly represent the ratio. He had not then the 'continued fraction', a mode of representation which he gave the next year in his work on the square root. He has but twenty of Van Ceulen's thirty places, which he takes from Clavius ...\nCataldi then looks at the more general question of constructing squares and rectangles with an area equal to that of a number of given shapes with curved edges. He illustrated these shapes with diagrams collected at the end of the book.\nCataldi also published an edition of\nEuclid\n's\nElements\n. He worked on\nEuclid\n's fifth postulate, attempting to prove the postulate was a consequence of the others in\nOperetta delle linee rette equidistanti et non equidistanti\nⓉ\n(\nWork on equidistant and non-equidistant straight lines\n)\n(1603)\n. His approach was the following. He defined equidistant straight lines as follows:\nA given straight line is said to be equidistant from another straight line in the same plane when the two shortest lines that are drawn from any two different points on the first line to the second line are equal.\nHe then proceeded to correctly deduce the Fifth Postulate. But wait a minute, we know that the Fifth Postulate cannot be deduced from the first four, for that is how non-Euclidean geometries come about. There must be an error somewhere, so where is it? In fact it is in the definition which Cataldi gave of equidistant for this definition, which we quoted above, assumes that the given line is the locus of points at a constant distance from the second line and it also assumes that it is a straight line. The compatibility of these two assumptions is\n(\nof course\n)\nequivalent to the Fifth Postulate. If you are still finding this a little difficult to understand, just consider a great circle on a sphere\n(\nthis is the shortest distance between two points and so the straight line in this geometry\n)\n. Now consider a line equidistant from the given great circle. This will not be a great circle, so is not the shortest distance between two points and so is not the analogue of a straight line in this geometry.\nCataldi tried, without success, to set up an academy of mathematics in Bologna. Despite the failure he left money in his will to set up a school in his own house but this also seems not to have happened.",
