  "biografia": "Sewall Green Wright\n's parents were Philip Green Wright and Elizabeth Quincy Sewall who were cousins. We should record right at the beginning of this article at Wright later dropped his middle name so was known simply as\nSewall Wright.\nPhilip Wright was an economist and in\n1892\nhe moved with his family to Galesburg, Illinois, to join the faculty at Lombard College where he taught mathematics, astronomy, surveying, and English composition in addition to economics.\nSewall had two brothers Quincy Wright and Theodore Paul Wright; they were all gifted children. He was educated at home until he was eight years old and by the time he entered school in\n1897\nhe had read his father's mathematics books, learning how to extract cube roots.\n(\nHow many mathematicians today know how to extract cube roots?\n)\nHe was fascinated by mathematical models and calculating, learning arithmetical methods from his mother. He had also read much natural history, influenced by his mother, and at the age of seven had written a pamphlet on natural history, with chapters on marmosets, ants, dinosaurs, chicken gizzards, and astronomy. Completing eight years of schooling in five, he entered Galesburg High School in\n1902\n, graduating in\n1906\n. In his final year in High School he read Darwin's\nOrigin of the Species\n. He then entered Lombard College where the intention of studying chemistry.\nThe next five years spent at Lombard College saw him move away from chemistry and instead he studied mathematics, reaching differential and integral calculus, and surveying in classes taught by his father. He worked during one summer vacation in South Dakota on the Chicago, Milwaukee and St Paul Railroad where he used the mathematical skills he was learning at College. In his final year he was influence by some fine teaching to become interested in biology and after graduating from Lombard College in\n1911\nwith a B.S. he moved to the University of Illinois for graduate work in biology. Wright had already some experience in such research having studied at the Carnegie Institution of Washington Station for Experimental Evolution at Cold Spring Harbor during the summers of\n1911\nand\n1912\n. He graduated with a master's degree from the University of Illinois in\n1912\n. Ernest William Castle visited the University of Illinois in Wright's final year and after, interviewing Wright, offered him an assistantship at Harvard's Bussey Institution. There he studied for his doctorate which was awarded in\n1915\nfor his dissertation on the inheritance of coat colours of guinea pigs. He developed new mathematical methods in this study.\nFor ten years, from\n1915\nto\n1925\n, Wright worked for the United States Department of Agriculture. An important method which he had worked out by\n1918\nwas a new statistical approach called path analysis. He applied this in many different situations in the following years. He married Louise Lane Williams, a genetics teacher at Smith College, in\n1921\n; they had three children, Richard Wright, Robert Wright, and Elizabeth Quincy Wright. Wright took up a post at the University of Chicago in\n1926\nwhich he held until he retired in\n1955\n. During this time he held two visiting professorships; he was Hitchcock Professor at the University of California Berkeley during\n1943\nand Fulbright Professor at the University of Edinburgh during session\n1949\n-\n1950\n.\nWright is famed for his work on evolution, in particular in the use of statistical techniques in the subject. In\n1942\nhe published the\nGibbs\nlecture that he had delivered in the\nBulletin of the American Mathematical Society\n. Opatowski writes in a review:-\nThis sixteenth\nGibbs\nlecture is a review of the prominent work done by the author in the last twelve years towards the establishment of a mathematical theory of evolution.\nHardy\n's formula, a mathematical consequence of Mendel's inheritance mechanism, requires the persistency of the relative frequency of genes in each set of alleles of an indefinitely large random breeding population free from evolutionary agents. Therefore the change of this frequency\n(\ncalled briefly the gene frequency q\n)\nis a measure of the evolution of the population. As a consequence of biologically plausible hypotheses compatible with the requirements of mathematical simplicity the change of q per generation is\n[\nfound\n]\n. ... Introducing\n[\nan\n]\napproximation, the author succeeds in deriving an explicit expression of the distribution function of the gene frequencies satisfying the conditions of a statistical equilibrium\n(\nconstant mean and constant variance\n)\n. The distribution curve ... clearly the slight effect of selection in small populations.\nAnother paper by Wright which shows his mathematical approach to the subject is\nThe differential equation of the distribution of gene frequencies\nwhich he published in\n1945\n. He derives differential equations which are satisfied by the probability density function of the distribution of gene frequencies under certain conditions. For example he considers: stationary distribution of gene frequencies; steady flow due to mutation pressure from gene frequency\n0\nto gene frequency\n1\nor vice versa; and nonstationary states.\nIn\n1950\nWright gave the\nGalton\nlecture at University College, London. In this lecture, which was later published as\nThe genetical structure of populations\n, he systematically applied his method of path coefficients to problems of population structure in a variety of situations such as: random mating and inbreeding; statistical properties of populations; the inbreeding coefficient\nF\nF\nF\n; hierarchic structure; natural populations; the island model of structure; isolation by distance; population structure in evolution; ecologic opportunity; and evolution in general. He also presented a number of mathematical appendices in the paper: the method of path coefficients; general coefficients of inbreeding; properties of populations as related to\nF\nF\nF\n; the inbreeding coefficient of breeds; regular systems of mating; and isolation by distance.\nFisher\nand Wright had differing views on the mechanism and importance of natural selection. Their disagreement began in the late\n1920\ns and became increasingly bitter leading to a split among evolutionists. Turner looks at this dispute in\n[\n10\n]\nand explains what divided these two leaders in mathematical population genetics:-\nFisher\nachieved a synthesis in which mutation was awarded a minimal role by being required to deliver variation to the selective machinery in the most finely divided state that was imaginable. His opposition to Sewall Wright's proposals that random drift was a creative force when allied to selection was a natural outgrowth of this philosophy.\nFisher\nmaintained that as a general proposition he believed in the essentially stochastic nature of causation, and the indeterminacy of the future. His opposition to the creative role of stochastic process in evolution arose therefore not from a belief in determinism, but from a belief in the sole power of natural selection to create order and adaptation.\nAfter retiring from Chicago, Wright joined the faculty of the University of Wisconsin as Leon J Cole Professor of Genetics. He worked for five years until his second retirement in\n1960\nbut he continued to undertake research up to his death at the age of\n98\n. His four volume masterpiece\nEvolution and the Genetics of Populations\nappeared between\n1968\nand\n1978\n(\nthat is when he was between the ages of\n80\nand\n90)\n.\nCrow writes in\n[\n7\n]\nabout Wright's teaching:-\nHe was a conscientious teacher, and spent many hours in the classroom and in the laboratory, which he ran himself.  ... His lectures invariably ran far over the allotted time.\nAs to his character, Crow writes\n[\n7\n]\n:-\nSocially, Wright was shy and retiring. He had no small talk and was hard to engage in conversation. But, paradoxically, when he did start to talk about something of interest - his childhood, his experience on the railroad surveying team, his ancestors, guinea pigs, evolution, genetics, politics - he could, and would, talk at length. ... He was always gentle, yet he defended his views forcefully and he stated them fully. ... In regard to his time, he was generous to a fault.\nWright received many honours such as the\nWeldon\nMedal from the\nRoyal Society\n(\nLondon\n)\nin\n1947\nand their Darwin Medal in\n1966\n. From the\nNational Academy of Sciences\n(\nUnited States\n)\nhe received the Elliott Award in\n1947\nand the Kimber Award in\n1956\n. In\n1966\nhe was awarded the National Medal of Science. In all he received nine major medals or prizes and was awarded ten honorary doctorates.",
