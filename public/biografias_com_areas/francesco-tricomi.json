  "biografia": "Francesco Tricomi\n's parents were Arturo Tricomi\n(1863\n-\n1928)\nand Corinna Di Lustro. Arturo Tricomi, born in Palermo on\n15\nSeptember\n1863\n, was an engineer and architect who became an extraordinary professor of Ornamental Design and Architecture at the University of Cagliari and in\n1906\nmoved to the University of Naples where he taught ornamental design in the Faculty of Mathematical Sciences. As an architect, among his works were the Palazzo Santa Lucia and the Villino Berlingieri, both in Naples.\nFrancesco studied first at the local Technical Institute where he was taught mathematics by Alfredo Perna, an excellent teacher who had published papers such as\nL'immaginario i ed i numeri alternati i, j, k nello studio delle deformazioni infinitesime delle curve piane e delle curve storte\nâ\n(\nThe imaginary\ni\nand the alternating numbers\ni, j, k\nin the study of the infinitesimal deformations of plane and skew curves\n)\n(1898)\nand\nLe equazioni delle curve in coordinate complesse coniugate\nâ\n(\nThe equations of curves in conjugate complex coordinates\n)\n(1903)\nin the\nRendiconti del Circolo Matematico di Palermo\n. In fact Perna became the ministerial supervisor and prepared the report on Teacher Training in Italy for the International Congress of Mathematicians in Zurich in\n1932\n. At first Tricomi had not found mathematics interesting for, as a student, he was interested in practical science problems. When Perna showed him how trigonometry could be used to predict eclipses, he began to find mathematics more exciting but when he graduated from the Technical Institute at the age of sixteen, he decided that he wanted to study chemistry at university.\nTricomi studied first at the University of Bologna, where he enrolled in chemistry classes in\n1913\n. He attended a few lectures by\nFederigo Enriques\nand quickly realised that he found mathematical physics much more to his liking than chemistry. After one year of chemistry at the University of Bologna, he decided that physics would suit him better so he spent\n1914\n-\n15\ntaking physics courses. This move to physics, of course, meant that he needed to take further mathematics courses and, quite soon, he realised that it was mathematics where his true passion lay. He moved to the University of Naples in\n1915\n, enrolling in the third year of the mathematics course there; his teachers included\nRoberto Marcolongo\nand Gabriele Torelli\n(1849\n-\n1931)\n.\nWorld War I had begun when Tricomi was still a student at Bologna. Italy had a defensive alliance with both Germany and Austro-Hungary but did not join them when the war began on\n28\nJuly\n1914\n. Italy negotiated with both the Central Powers and with the Allies, signing a pact with the Allies in April\n1915\nand declaring war on Austro-Hungary in the following month. Fighting in the Alps was fierce but neither side gained the upper hand. In August\n1916\nItaly declared war on Germany and, around the same time, Tricomi, then at the University of Naples, was called up for military service. He was sent first to a training course at for students at the Military Academy of Turin where he trained and was appointed as an officer on\n1\nApril\n1917\n. He was then sent to the front at the Karst where the Italians were about to made a massive attack against the Austrians. This was nearly successful but, with victory in sight, they had to withdraw as their supply lines became too extended. Germany then sent troops to support the Austrians and the Italians, after being routed by the combined force, managed to halt the combined German-Austrian advance at Monte Grappa. Tricomi was involved in the fighting at Monte Grappa in December\n1917\n. The Italian troops, however, fell back to defend Venice at the Piave river where they again successfully stopped the Austrian advance. Tricomi, always at the centre of hostilities, was involved in the fighting at Piave in June\n1918\n.\nRather remarkably, despite all this involvement in fighting with the Italian army, Tricomi had been able to continue with his studies and he had been awarded a degree in mathematics from the University of Naples on\n16\nApril\n1918\n. World War I ended on\n11\nNovember\n1918\n, but he remained in military service until\n1920\nwhen he was discharged, was decorated with two military crosses, and was able to return to the University of Naples. He undertook research under Gabriele Torelli but found the environment at Naples difficult. Always someone of independent thought, the environment at Naples at that time was too authoritarian for him and, with a strong recommendation from\nUgo Amaldi\n, he was appointed as an assistant to\nFrancesco Severi\nin the chair of analytical geometry at the University of Padua in\n1921\n.\nAfter a brief period in Padua he moved again, this time to the University of Rome in the spring of\n1922\n. The reason for the move was simply that\nSeveri\nhad been appointed to the chair of algebraic and infinitesimal analysis at the University of Rome and he invited Tricomi to follow him. This move meant he arrived into a remarkably strong mathematical environment which included\nVito Volterra\n,\nGuido Castelnuovo\n,\nFederigo Enriques\n,\nTullio Levi-Civita\nand\nGiuseppe Bagnera\n. We have already mentioned Tricomi's very independent nature so, despite this collection of world-leading mathematicians, he was always going to work alone without having anyone tell him what to do. This did not mean, however, that he did not understand that an Institute required top class people and he firmly held this belief throughout his life. Soon after arriving in Rome, Tricomi had submitted his first paper for publication, namely\nSu di un'equazione integrale di prima specie\nâ\n(\nOn an integral equation of the first kind\n)\nwhich appeared in the\nRendiconti del Circolo Matematico di Palermo\nin\n1922\n. The paper begins:-\nIn a recent note, Prof\nLevi-Civita\nshowed how the problem of determining the harmonic function close to an assigned function U - that is, of the harmonic function that in a given range\n(\nin three dimensions\n)\nis closest, on average, to U - can be reduced, on the one hand, to the inversion of a certain integral equation of the first kind with constant limits, and, on the other, to a biharmonic problem, that is to say to the determination of a biharmonic function whose surface values are known together with those of its normal derivative. For this second way the author then arrives at the resolution of the question considered by him.\nIn\n1924\nthe University of Florence advertised a competition for the chair of Algebraic and Infinitesimal Analysis. Tricomi competed and was offered the chair which he accepted and took up the appointment in February\n1925\n.\nEnrico D'Ovidio\nhad retired from the University of Turin in\n1922\nand in November\n1925\nTricomi was called to the University of Turin as an extraordinary professor of algebraic analysis and in charge of complementary mathematics. Erika Luciano writes\n[\n19\n]\n:-\nUpon his arrival in the Turin faculty he immediately perceived some tensions in the teaching staff, determined by the presence of two groups: the 'Jewish' one, to which\nGino Fano\nand\nGuido Fubini\nadhered, and the 'vectorist' one of\nGiuseppe Peano\n,\nTommaso Boggio\nand\nCesare Burali-Forti\n. The sympathies of Tricomi went without hesitation to the first group, also because of the solid friendship that bound him to\nFubini\nand\nAlessandro Terracini\n. However, Tricomi was also strongly appreciated by\nPeano\nwho, as early as\n1925\n, proposed to him to exchange his teaching of complementary mathematics with that of infinitesimal calculus. He would formally become the owner of the latter, however, only from\n1932\n.\nIn fact before he moved to Turin he had already published a paper in\n1923\nwhich was to become very famous. In this paper,\nSulle equazioni lineari alle derivate parziali di\n2\nÂ° ordine di tipo misto\nâ\n(\nOn the linear partial differential equations of\n2\nnd order of mixed type\n)\n, he studied the theory of partial differential equations of mixed type, in particular the equation\ny\nu\nx\nx\n+\nu\ny\ny\n=\n0\nyu_{xx} + u_{yy} = 0\ny\nu\nx\nx\nâ\n+\nu\ny\ny\nâ\n=\n0\n,\nnow known as the 'Tricomi equation'. The equation became important in describing an object moving at supersonic speed. Of course there were no supersonic aircraft in\n1923\nbut the equation was to play a major role in later studies of supersonic flight as shown by\nTheodore von Karman\nand the Austrian physicist Felix Frankl\n(1905\n-\n1961)\n.\nIn\n1931\n, Tricomi married Susanna Fomm\n(1904\n-\n1959)\nin Germany. They had no children and Susanna, who was \"gifted with a meek and sweet-tempered temperament\" suffered very poor health which was a constant worry to her husband.\nBenito Mussolini had become Italian Prime Minister in\n1922\nand over the following years brought in laws which made Italy a fascist one-party dictatorship. Tricomi was a vigorous anti-Fascist so the political situation became more and more troublesome to him. One consequence was that it led to Tricomi giving all the support he could to people and organisations which fascism opposed. Two in particular we must mention. It made him a strong supporter of Jewish people and of the Waldensians\n.\nThe first of these will need no explanation to our readers but the second of these might. The Waldensians were founded by Peter Waldo in the\n1170\ns as a religious movement within the Catholic Church but declared heretical by the Catholic Church\n40\nyears later. It is considered by many as a forerunner of the Reformation. By\n1938\nItaly began to promulgate racial laws requiring discrimination against Jews.\nGino Fano\nwas one of Tricomi's colleagues at Turin and, because of the racial laws, he was deprived of his chair in\n1938\n. Tricomi did his utmost to assist\nFano\n, getting books and journals for him so that he could continue his mathematics. Tricomi also helped his colleague\nAlessandro Terracini\npublish the high school algebra textbook\nAlgebra elementare ad uso dei licei\nâ\n(\nElementary algebra for high school use\n)\n(1940)\nunder Tricomi's name. We note that in this book\nTerracini\nfully developed the theory of real numbers according to\nDedekind\n's construction.\nTerracini\nalso lost his chair in Turin in\n1938\nand, in the following year emigrated to Argentina.\nOf course, Tricomi's actions in helping Jewish colleagues put him in considerable danger and the entry of Italy into World War II made his position even more difficult. The centre of the Waldensian church was in Torre Pellice, in the valleys about\n45\nkm southwest of Turin and, in the autumn of\n1942\n, he was forced to leave Turin and take refuge in Torre Pellice with his mother Corinna, his wife Susanna, and Susanna's sister. In September\n1943\nGerman troops entered the north of Italy and created the Republic of SalÃ², a puppet state they set up for MussoliniÂ after Italy surrendered to the Allies on\n8\nSeptember\n1943\n. This put Tricomi and his family in extreme danger in Torre Pellice and they went into hiding, eventually being able to make their way to Rome. Once there, he lived clandestinely as a guest of the Waldensian, Paolo Bosio\n(1891\n-\n1959)\n, Pastor of the Piazza Cavour Church in Rome. When there, Tricomi continued to help Jewish colleagues and friends, such as\nGuido Castelnuovo\nand\nFederigo Enriques\nboth of whom had been forced into hiding but were running an illegal school instructing Jewish students who were suffering discrimination.\nAfter Rome was freed by the Allies,\nCastelnuovo\nasked Tricomi to remain in Rome and help him with the reconstruction of mathematics in the university there. The Allies, however, quickly put a stop to this, appointing\n(\nno doubt for political reasons\n)\na far less able person to be in charge of the reconstruction. Tricomi returned to Turin in\n1944\nwhere he resumed his university teaching.\nIn the late\n1930\ns, Tricomi had begun to publish books, many of them based on lecture courses he was giving at Turin. After the war he published further editions of the books he had already published, and continued with further volumes. His books were widely praised and translated from Italian into English, French, German and Russian.\nYou can see the titles and lots more information about these books at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nHere are a couple of typical comments by reviewers.\nArthur ErdÃ©lyi\n, reviewing\nLezioni sulle funzioni ipergeometriche confluenti\nâ\n(\nLectures on confluent hypergeometric functions\n)\n(1952)\nwrites\n[\n7\n]\n:-\nTricomi's book is based on a course of lectures given at the University of Torino, and it is written with that gift for exposition for which its author is so justly famous.\nRichard Bellman\n, reviewing\nLezioni sulle equazioni a derivate parziali\nâ\n(\nLessons on partial differential equations\n)\n(1954)\n, writes\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nThis book furnishes an excellent introduction to the rapidly expanding theory of partial differential equations, written in the author's usual lucid and interesting style.\nThe praise given in these and many other reviews certainly rated the books vastly superior to that suggested by the modest comment Tricomi wrote in the preface of one of them:-\nMaybe I have not succeeded to make difficult things easy, but at least I have never made an easy subject difficult.\nA few years after the end of the war, he was involved in the\nBateman\nproject. In\n1946\nHarry Bateman\ndied and\nArthur ErdÃ©lyi\nheaded a team, which included\nWilhelm Magnus\nand Tricomi, working at the California Institute of Technology to publish the vast range of material left by\nBateman\n. The team produced three volumes of\nHigher Transcendental Functions\nand two volumes of\nTables of Integral Transforms\n.\nYou can read part of\nErdÃ©lyi\n's introduction, and some reviews of these books at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nTricomi participated in the International Congress of Mathematicians at Cambridge, Massachusetts in September\n1950\nwhile in the United States. He gave the lecture On the\nIncomplete Gamma Function\n. He began as follows:-\nIn the preparation of a monograph on the confluent hypergeometric functions for the \"\nBateman\nManuscript Project\" I have had occasion to point out many probably new properties of the incomplete gamma function.\nThis was not the first International Congress of Mathematicians that Tricomi had attended, for he had been at Bologna in\n1928\nand Zurich in\n1932\nwhen he gave the lecture\nPeriodische LÃ¶sungen einer Differentialgleichung erster Ordnung\nâ\n(\nPeriodic solutions of a first order differential equation\n)\n. He also attended later International Congresses of Mathematicians, at Amsterdam in\n1954\nwhen he gave the address\nAsymptotische Eigenschaften der konfluenten hypergeometrischen Funktionen\nâ\n(\nAsymptotic properties of confluent hypergeometric functions\n)\nand at Edinburgh, Scotland in\n1958\n, when he gave the lecture\nQuo vadimus?\nâ\n(\nWhere are we going?\n)\n. He began this lecture as follows:-\nExactly thirty years ago\nGino Loria\nmade a communication with the same title as the present at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Bologna. As in the case of\nLoria\n, this title wants to have the meaning of a cry of alarm in the face of the enormous, uncontrolled development of today's mathematical publications.\nYou can read a version of this lecture at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nIn late\n1950\nTricomi left the United States and returned to Turin to continue his remarkable research output. Tricomi's autobiography\n[\n32\n]\nlists\n300\npapers, while a further\n46\nare listed in\n[\n14\n]\n. These papers cover a vast range of subjects including singular integrals, differential and integral equations, pseudodifferential operators, functional transforms, special functions, probability theory and its applications to number theory. Erika Luciano writes\n[\n19\n]\n:-\nTrichomi left a profound mark in the field of special functions and functional transformations in the classical sense. Starting from the study of the differential equation of confluent hypergeometric functions, he introduced an appropriate integral of this\n(\ncalled the Trichomi function\n)\nwhich together with the\nKummer\nfunction allows one to obtain as particular cases many special functions, including those of\nBessel\n, the polynomials of\nLaguerre\n,\nHermite\netc.\nEqually numerous and important were his results on multidimensional singular integral equations containing the main value of an improper integral, and his works on asymptotic evaluations, on series developments, on the theory of transformations\n(\nby\nBessel\n,\nGauss\n,\nHankel\n)\nwith related applications. In the field of applied mathematics, the contributions of numerical computation and of probability and statistics stand out, including the first quantitative theory of the phenomenon of bacterial resistance.\nTricomi was an editor of\nAequationes Mathematicae\nfrom the time the journal was founded in\n1968\nuntil his death. The editors described him as:-\nA forthright man, outspoken opponent of dictatorships of all colours, of sloppiness, of abstraction for abstraction's sake, and of the 'publish or perish' syndrome, his interests went far beyond mathematical research. Here we mention only his interest in the teaching of mathematics and in expository work, which led him to write several excellent textbooks, eventually translated from their original Italian to English, French, German and Russian.\nTricomi had a deep interest in problems concerning the history of mathematics and he published many important articles on this topic. In fact, references to articles on\nGiovanni Plana\n,\nGuido Ascoli\n,\nBernhard Riemann\n,\nSalvatore Pincherle\n,\nJacques Hadamard\n,\nTommaso Boggio\n,\nGiuseppe Veronese\n,\nFrancesco Gerbaldi\n,\nDuilio Gigli\n,\nCesare ArzelÃ\n,\nGiuseppe Basso\n,\nGiuseppe Vitali\n,\nFederigo Enriques\n,\nRoberto Marcolongo\n,\nGuido Fubini\n,\nGiovanni Ricci\n,\nErnesto Pascal\nand\nMauro Picone\nwritten by him appear in this Archive.\nHis influence on mathematics goes well beyond the impressive results of his research. His writings have made an important contribution towards the present development of science. As the editors of\nAequationes Mathematicae\nwrite:-\n... the problems ... which he has solved and the theories which he has initiated and others have continued to work on, will keep his name alive. His passing away is a great loss to the international mathematical community.\nGaetano Fichera\nwrites\n[\n13\n]\n:-\nTricomi enjoyed the esteem and the deep respect for the entire Italian mathematical community. And truly sincere was the condolences for his death. Abroad, especially in the United States and the Soviet Union, he was considered a legendary figure, one of the greatest mathematicians of this century.\nHis wife died in her middle\n50\ns in\n1959\nand, having no children, Tricomi spent his final years as a rather lonely figure after he retired in\n1972\n. His final months are described in\n[\n13\n]\n:-\nIn the first days of July last year\n[\n1978]\n, Francesco Tricomi left Turin at the wheel of his little Volkswagen. Driving in his unmistakable style, he crossed the Alps to reach Switzerland and spend his summer holidays there, as usual.\nHe had turned\n81\non the previous\n5\nMay, but his health was excellent, his mind was very clear, his physical appearance was excellent with his tall, elegant figure always erect and imposing. All of us had seen this during the last academic sessions, in June of last year.\nAfter a peaceful vacation in Switzerland, he returned to Italy in September and resumed the life he had led in Turin since he retired. A solitary life, very methodical, according to his custom, but illuminated by long hours of reading and studying at his work table and interspersed with visits to the\nTurin Academy of Sciences\n, whose activity he scrupulously followed, and, by participation in some conferences of interest to him, at the Turin Mathematical Seminar. A few days ago he had attended a conference on relativity at the\nTurin Academy of Sciences\nand participated in a numerical analysis conference at the Mathematical Institute, when an illness, as sudden as a thunderbolt, struck him on the evening of\n19\nOctober, while he was in his studio looking for a publication in his highly ordered miscellany which he wished to consult. Transported to the hospital, the doctors immediately recognised the extreme severity of the disease. However, his very strong constitution lasted for over a month. He died in the early afternoon of\n21\nNovember, after long suffering endured with virile courage.\nAccording to his wishes, after his death in a hospital in Turin from a circulatory disease, he was buried in the small cemetery of Torre Pellice.",
