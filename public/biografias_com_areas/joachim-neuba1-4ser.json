  "biografia": "Joachim NeubÃ¼ser\nwas born in Belgard, Pomerania, a town of about\n15\n,\n000\ninhabitants about\n25\nkm from the Baltic Sea coast. Today it is BiaÅogard, in Poland, but when Joachim was born there it was part of Germany. Joachim was a friend and colleague of mine\n[\nEFR\n]\nwhom I worked with for many years, so some details in the biography below come from things he told me about his life while some are from personal experiences working with him.\nJoachim NeubÃ¼ser was only six months old when, in January\n1933\n, Adolf Hitler, the leader of the Nazi Party, became chancellor and head of the German government. Pomerania, part of Germany at this time, came under Nazi rule. Arguments between Germany and Poland over the region were used by Hitler as a reason to invade Poland in\n1939\nwhich marked the start of World War II. At this time Joachim was seven years old and had just begun has schooling. The war years were not easy and from\n1943\nonwards Pomerania became the target of Allied bombing. Many parts of Germany were finding conditions far worse, however, and families fled, particularly from Berlin, to Pomerania which was safer. At the beginning of\n1945\nRussian troops began attacking Pomerania which became a major battlefield. Families now sought safer places and the NeubÃ¼ser family, like many others, moved west, settling in Oldenburg.\nBy May\n1945\nBritish and Canadian forces had advanced east as far as Oldenburg. German propaganda had painted the Allied troops as evil men who would murder and destroy, so Joachim and his family were terrified when they knew British and Canadian forces were approaching. A group of residents, including the NeubÃ¼ser family, stood waiting in dread. As the soldiers reached them, the group pushed the twelve year old Joachim out, shaking with fear, to talk to the soldiers since he was the only one who knew a little English. He was overwhelmed by the kindness of the soldiers and there was still emotion in his voice when he told me\n[\nEFR\n]\nthis story\n45\nyears later.\nJoachim NeubÃ¼ser completed his schooling in Oldenburg in\n1951\nand later in that year he entered the University of Kiel to study mathematics. He worked for both a school teacher's certificate and for his doctorate in mathematics advised by\nWolfgang GaschÃ¼tz\n.\nAfter\nGaschÃ¼tz\ndied, Joachim wrote to me\n[\nEFR\n]\non\n11\nNovember\n2016\n:-\n[\nWolfgang GaschÃ¼tz\n]\nhas never worked on Computational Group Theory though he certainly caused my curiosity for the 'inside' of groups that lead me to my first attempts to look for a way of computing subgroup lattices.\nIn\n1957\nJoachim NeubÃ¼ser graduated from the University of Kiel with the Staatsexamen\n(\nthe school teacher qualification\n)\n, and his doctorate\n(\nDr. rer. nat.\n)\nwith his thesis\nÃber homogene Gruppen\nâ\n(\nOn homogeneous groups\n)\n. He attended the International Congress of Mathematicians held at the University of Cambridge, England, in August\n1958\nand gave a short lecture on the results of his thesis.\nThe award of a British Council scholarship funded a postdoctoral year\n1957\n-\n58\nfor Joachim at the University of Manchester. At this time Manchester was an exciting place for a young group theorist.\nMax Newman\nheld the chair of Mathematics and worked on combinatorial topology but he had undertaken work on computers during World War II and had appointed\nAlan Turing\nto Manchester. He had also appointed to Manchester, among others,\nB H Neumann\nwho was one of the leading group theorists. When Joachim NeubÃ¼ser arrived in Manchester he was immediately introduced to four Ph.D. students of\nB H Neumann\n, namely\nJim Wiegold\n,\nGilbert Baumslag\n, Ian David Macdonald and Michael Frederick Newman. All four would become important figures the group theory with three of the four making important contributions to computational group theory.\nJim Wiegold\nsubmitted his doctoral dissertation entitled\nNilpotent products of groups with amalgamations\ninÂ\n1958\nÂ and was awarded his Ph.D.\nGilbert Baumslag\nwas also awarded his Ph.D. in\n1958\n; his thesis, was entitled\nSome aspects of groups with unique roots\n. Both Ian D Macdonald and Mike Newman were near the beginning of their studies and both graduated with a Ph.D. in\n1960\n, Ian Macdonald with the thesis\nOn Groups with Conditions like Finiteness of Conjugacy Classes\nand Mike Newman with the thesis\nOn Groups All of Whose Proper Homomorphic Images are Nilpotent\n.\nThe authors of\n[\n8\n]\nwrite:-\nJoachim NeubÃ¼ser arrived in Manchester with a list of hand-calculated\nHasse\ndiagrams of the subgroup lattices of all groups of order at most\n31\n. It seems likely that he had already considered the idea to use computers for automating such calculations before arriving in England. Working in the mathematics department in Manchester clearly made this idea seem more feasible. He was encouraged in this view by\nBernhard Neumann\n, who told him that although using computers in group theory might be unusual, it would be worth pursuing.\nAfter his postdoctoral year at Manchester, Joachim returned to Kiel in\n1958\nwhere he was appointed as an assistant to\nWolfgang GaschÃ¼tz\n. Kiel had just purchased a Zuse Z\n22\ncomputer and Joachim set about writing programs to compute subgroup lattices\n[\n8\n]\n:-\n... Joachim NeubÃ¼ser often spent nights and weekends at the Z\n22\n, programming the machine and watching it work. Programs were handed to the Z\n22\nin the form of punched tape, and Joachim NeubÃ¼ser was able to read the programs on these tapes fluently.\nThis work led to his first two papers\nUntersuchungen des Untergruppenverbandes endlicher Gruppen auf einer programmgesteuerten electronischen Dualmaschine\nâ\n(\nInvestigations of the subgroup lattice of finite groups on a program-controlled electronic dual machine\n)\n(1960)\nand\nBestimmung der UntergruppenverbÃ¤nde endlicher p-Gruppen auf einer programmgesteuerten elektronischen Dualmaschine\nâ\n(\nDetermination of the subgroup lattices of finite p-groups on a program-controlled electronic dual machine\n)\n(1961)\n. In the first of these he writes\n[\n13\n]\n:-\nWhen examining group-theoretic problems, it is often useful to test the question using a larger sample of material. However, a more detailed discussion of special groups, if they are not of a well-known type such as abelian groups, can require a considerable amount of computation. It is therefore natural to try to use electronic calculators to study and discuss specific groups.\nIn group theory, there are hardly any systematic methods for investigating the structure of a given group; only a few calculation methods are used more frequently, such as that of residue class enumeration, for a group given by generators and defining relations, with the aim of obtaining a permutation representation for it. When discussing a group, one tends to make use of group-theoretic theorems that are applicable to the specific group, in order to avoid lengthy calculations as far as possible. The use of an electronic calculating machine, on the other hand, only makes sense if a systematic procedure is established which can be applied to any group or at least to a large classes of groups. To a limited extent\n(\ndue to the memory capacity of the machine\n)\n, changes in the calculation method based on already known partial results using group-theoretic theorems can be taken into account by branches of the program.\nReviewing this paper,\nD H Lehmar\nwrites:-\nA description is given of a program designed to analyse the structure of finite groups with the aid of a binary digital computer instead of theorems. The group elements are represented by permutations onÂ nÂ marks. One or more words are used to store one permutation, usingÂ nÂ subwords, each sufficiently large to store a number fromÂ\n1\nÂ toÂ n. Thus, forÂ n =\n19\n,\n5\nbits are required for each mark and so\n7\nmarks are packed into each of\n2\nwords and the remaining\n5\nmarks are packed into a third word.\n(\nA\n38\nbit word is used.\n)\nThe program generates the group from the given generators and proceeds to analyse the group by means of cyclic subgroups. It reports out\n(\na\n)\nthe order of the group,\n(\nb\n)\nthe number of cyclic subgroups of prime power order,\n(\nc\n)\nthe total number of subgroups, and\n(\nd\n)\nthe number of classes of conjugate subgroups. Space and time restrictions of the machine, a Zuse\n22\n, limit the program to groups of order about\n300\n, without outside human assistance.\nThe\n1961\npaper was reviewed by\nBrian Haselgrove\nwho writes\n[\n9\n]\n:-\nThis paper describes a method for enumerating the subgroups of a group of order\np\nn\np^{n}\np\nn\nwhich has been programmed for the computer Zuse\n22\n. It is found that a group of order\n2\n7\n2^{7}\n2\n7\nwith\n514\nsubgroups and\n334\nclasses of conjugate subgroups required\n8\nhours of computation, whereas another group of the same order with\n386\nsubgroups and\n224\nclasses requiredÂ\n5\n1\n2\n5\\large\\frac{1}{2}\\normalsize\n5\n2\n1\nâ\nhours.\nIn\n1967\nthe first major conference on computation in abstract algebra was held in Oxford, England from\n29\nAugust to\n2\nSeptember. By this time Joachim was head of perhaps the most active research group on computational group theory and he gave the major survey\nInvestigations of groups on computers\n, see\n[\n15\n]\n. His research group had six members, all of whom present at the meeting contributing several papers.\nNow\n1967\nwas an eventful year for Joachim NeubÃ¼ser for in that year he completed work on his habilitation thesis\nDie UntergruppenverbÃ¤nde der Gruppen der Ordnung â¤\n100\nmit Ausnahme der Ordnungen\n64\nund\n96\nâ\n(\nThe subgroup lattices of the groups of order d â¤\n100\nexcept for orders\n64\nand\n96\n)\n. This led to his promotion at Kiel. Also in\n1967\nhe married Freya Schwarck. Freya had studied for a doctorate at Kiel advised by\nWolfgang GaschÃ¼tz\nand\nFriedrich Bachmann\nand had been awarded a Dr. rer. nat. in\n1963\nfor her thesis\nDie Frattini-Algebra einer Lie-Algebra\nâ\n(\nThe Frattini algebra of a Lie algebra.\n)\n. Freya was so kind to me when I visited them and she cooked a wonderful meal. She asked me what my favourite meal was and she cooked that for me on my next visit.\nIn\n1969\nJoachim was named chair of the Lehrstuhl D fÃ¼r Mathematik at the Rheinisch-WestfÃ¤lische Technische Hochschule\n(\nRWTH Aachen University\n)\n. The Lehrstuhl D fÃ¼r Mathematik was a new department, specially created to bring Joachim NeubÃ¼ser to Aachen. He brought two colleagues from Kiel to help in founding the Department, namely Volkmar Felsch and Rolf BÃ¼low. With their help Joachim began to quickly establish a major computational group theory team. He was now one of three major figures in computational group theory, the other two being\nCharles Sims\nand John Cannon. In the Preface of his\n1994\nbook\nComputation with finitely presented groups\nSims\nwrote\n[\n19\n]\n:-\nInÂ\n1970\n, John Cannon, Joachim NeubÃ¼ser, and I considered the possibility of jointly producing a single book which would cover all of computational group theory. A draft table of contents was even produced, but the project was not completed. It is a measure of how far the subject has progressed in the pastÂ\n20\nÂ years that it would now take at least four substantial books to cover the field, not including the necessary background material on group theory and the design and analysis of algorithms.\nAround\n1971\nJoachim NeubÃ¼ser and John Cannon began a collaboration on a general purpose computational group theory system called the Aachen-Sydney Group System. This system has developed into MAGMA, a system widely used today for computations in algebra, number theory, algebraic geometry, and algebraic combinatorics. Joachim, however, left the project in the early\n1980\ns mainly due to having a different vision about computer systems. You can see what these differences were by looking at the section \"Some concerns\" of Joachim's lecture\nA history of computational group theory\n; see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nLet me\n[\nEFR\n]\nnow say a little about how I collaborated with Joachim NeubÃ¼ser. I was an undergraduate at the University of St Andrews, wrote a Ph.D. thesis on infinite dimensional matrix groups at the University of Warwick and was appointed to St Andrews in\n1968\n. There I had two colleagues, Mike Beetham who had written a\nTodd\n-\nCoxeter\ncoset enumeration program, and Colin Campbell who, advised by\nWillie Moser\n, had written an M.Sc. thesis on\nNathan Mendelsohn\n's modification of\nTodd\n-\nCoxeter\n. I became interested in computational group theory and when I heard that Ian D Macdonald, who had produced one of the cleverest ideas in computational group theory, the\np\np\np\n-Nilpotent-Quotient method, had moved from Australia to Stirling in Scotland, I invited him to lecture at St Andrews. We became good friends and, around the beginning of\n1979\nIan told me that Joachim NeubÃ¼ser had produced a counter-example to the class breadth conjecture. Ian said he wished he could find out the details, so I suggested that I invite Joachim to come to St Andrews. He came in the summer of\n1979\nand lectured to a small group including David Johnson who came from Nottingham with his Ph.D. student.\nJoachim gave a series of excellent lectures on\nCounterexamples to the class-breadth conjecture\nand while he was in St Andrews I asked him if he would be a main speaker if Colin Campbell and myself organised a bigger conference in\n1981\n. Joachim agreed, provided we chose dates to fit in with the German school holidays. In addition, we invited Sean Tobin and\nJim Wiegold\nto be main speakers and they agreed. With large numbers registering for the conference Groups St Andrews\n1981\n, Joachim said we needed more than three main speakers so we invited Derek Robinson. These four gave five-lecture surveys which were published in the conference\nProceedings\n. Joachim's lecture series\nAn elementary introduction to coset table methods in computational group theory\nwas expanded into a\n45\n-page article in the\nProceedings\n. Let me explain here that Colin Campbell and myself were editors of the\nProceedings\nand made the\n(\nperhaps silly\n)\ndecision to unify the style of the references in all the papers. When Joachim saw it he was furious we had changed his reference style and told me so in no uncertain terms. Then he said he'd got it off his chest, it was now all forgotten, no hard feelings. Unfortunately, we had to change Joachim's reference style in his article \"History of computational group theory up to\n1993\n\" at\nTHIS LINK\nso it would work in MacTutor. Joachim would have been furious.\nThe demand for the\nProceedings\nover the years was largely because of this article and it was so great that Cambridge University Press asked us to produce a second edition\n25\nyears later. In this second edition we wrote in\n[\n3\n]\n:-\nEven after\n25\nyears the article by Joachim NeubÃ¼ser remains the first source to which all three of us refer those who want to find out about the use of coset tables for studying groups. Our view is confirmed by the\n14\nReference Citations from\n1998\nto\n2005\nwhich MathSciNet reveals for this article. ... One of NeubÃ¼ser's aims in writing his survey was to provide a unified view on coset table methods in computational group theory. He addressed the way coset table concepts were developed, implemented and used.\nWe note that from\n1998\nto\n2022\nthere are now\n25\nReference Citations to this article in MathSciNet.\nA number of computer algebra systems were developed in Aachen by Joachim in collaboration with other colleagues. In\n1981\nCAS was announced which consisted of an interactive collection of programs designed to compute and work with character tables of finite groups. In\n1982\nthe system Sogos became available based on Joachim NeubÃ¼ser's algorithm to compute subgroup lattices. In\n1989\nSPAS was produced in Aachen containing versions of the modified\nTodd\n-\nCoxeter\nand\nTietze\nTransformation programs which had been developed at St Andrews.\nThe system for which Joachim NeubÃ¼ser is best known is GAP which began life around\n1985\n. I was awarded an EPSRC grant 'A computer program to learn group theory techniques',\n1984\n-\n87\n, to work with my Ph.D. student Kevin Rutherford on developing a computational group theory system. Some time in\n1985\nI suggested to Joachim that we apply to the European Communities\n(\nEC\n)\n(\nwhich became the EU in\n1995)\n, for funds to develop a computer algebra system. I told Joachim about the system I was developing with Kevin Rutherford and Joachim replied that he just begun developing a similar system called GAP.\n(\nOriginally GAP stood for Groups And Programming, but was soon changed into Groups Algorithms Programming.\n)\nWe decided to go ahead with an application to the EC for developing GAP. Our first application to the EC for a \"twinning grant\" was rejected on the grounds we were not asking for enough money. We then added Galway, Ireland\n(\nthe EC seemed happy with\n3\ntwins!\n)\nand asked for the grant 'Intelligent computer algebra systems' to support travel, research assistants, and equipment. This was awarded with myself as scientific coordinator which meant I did most of the administrative work but Joachim led the development of GAP. This was the first of four major EC grants, the other three being: 'Using computer algebra',\n1993\n-\n94\n, involving co-operation between St Andrews, Aachen, Trento, and five Hungarian Universities; 'Computational Group Theory',\n1993\n-\n96\n, involving co-operation between St Andrews, Aachen and nine other EC centres of computational algebra expertise; and 'Using computer algebra',\n1994\n-\n96\n, involving co-operation between St Andrews, RWTH Aachen, Germany, Universita degli studi di Trento, Trento, Italy, Lorand Eotvos Budapest Hungary, Technical University of Budapest, Budapest, Hungary, Lajos Kossuth University, Debrecen, Hungary, and the University of Miskolc, Miscolc, Hungary.\nI was the scientific co-ordinator for all four of these grants but I was greatly helped by Joachim in writing the reports which we would discuss in detail before I wrote them. To get an impression of the GAP development that came about from these grants, you can read a draft of the final report I wrote for the 'Computational Group Theory' one. I sent this draft to Joachim in March\n1997\nfor his comments, see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nWe organised Groups\n1993\nGalway / St Andrews. We wrote in the Preface:-\nAn invitation to Professor J NeubÃ¼ser\n(\nAachen\n)\nto arrange a workshop on Computational Group Theory and the use of GAP was taken up so enthusiastically by him that the workshop became effectively a fully-fledged parallel meeting throughout the second week, with over thirty hours of lectures by experts and with practical sessions organised by M SchÃ¶nert\n(\nAachen\n)\n. These Proceedings contain an article by Professor NeubÃ¼ser based on a lecture he gave in the first week of the conference.\nJoachim was keen to begin the GAP workshop at\n8\na.m. each day but after a little gentle persuasion he agreed, somewhat reluctantly, to begin at\n9\na.m.\nOn\n31\nJuly\n1997\nJoachim NeubÃ¼ser retired and GAP headquarters formally moved from Aachen to St Andrews. He wrote on\n30\nJune\n1995\n:-\nAfter careful consideration and discussion with various colleagues, I have come to the conclusion not to take the risk if my successor as chairman of Lehrstuhl D, who after all might get determined only shortly before my retirement, will be interested to further the development of GAP in a similar way as I have done. It seemed to be better and safer for GAP and the community of its users to hand the responsibility for GAP in time before my retirement to a group of colleagues who are both competent and willing to take over the work of the further development and maintenance of GAP.\n...\nLet me finally state a point that is very important to me. The colleagues in St Andrew completely agree with me that also in their hands GAP will remain a system that can be obtained free of charge and with completely open source of kernel, library and data. Also the present support of the community of GAP users by GAP-forum and GAP-trouble will be maintained.\nAfter he retired, Joachim, of course, continued to take a passionate interest in GAP development and was in frequent contact with me. GAP continued to be developed and it was awarded the ACM/SIGSAM Richard Dimick Jenks Memorial Prize for Excellence in Software Engineering applied to Computer Algebra in July\n2008\n.\nTo read Joachim NeubÃ¼ser's \"History of computational group theory up to\n1993\n\" see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nIn his\n1993\nlecture, Joachim NeubÃ¼ser spoke about \"Some concerns\" looking at the positive and negative aspects of using a computer to solve algebra problems. For example, he wrote\n[\n16\n]\n:-\nYou can read\nSylow\n's Theorem and its proof in Huppert's book in the library without even buying the book and then you can use\nSylow\n's Theorem for the rest of your life free of charge, but ... for many computer algebra systems license fees have to be paid regularly for the total time of their use. In order to protect what you pay for, you do not get the source, but only an executable, i.e. a black box. You can press buttons and you get answers in the same way as you get the bright pictures from your television set but you cannot control how they were made in either case.\nWith this situation two of the most basic rules of conduct in mathematics are violated: In mathematics information is passed on free of charge and everything is laid open for checking. Not applying these rules to computer algebra systems that are made for mathematical research ... means moving in a most undesirable direction. Most important: Can we expect somebody to believe a result of a program that he is not allowed to see? Moreover: Do we really want to charge colleagues in Moldova several years of their salary for a computer algebra system?\nFor more of Joachim NeubÃ¼ser's \"Some concerns\", see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nIn September\n2021\n, Bettina Eick and Alexander Hulpke announced Joachim NeubÃ¼ser's death to the GAP Forum\n[\n7\n]\n:-\nIt is with immense sadness we would like to inform you that Joachim NeubÃ¼ser passed away on Saturday, September\n25\n, after a long illness. He was the founder of the GAP System and also one of the main initiators of Computational Group Theory in its early days.\n...\nMany modern group theoretic algorithms have been influenced by his work and the GAP System, of which he was the leader until his retirement\n1997\n, is still one of the world leading computer algebra systems today.\nAs two of his doctoral students, both of us owe much of our education in group theory, and in algorithms, to him.\nIn Gratitude,\nBettina Eick and Alexander Hulpke.\nPeter Cameron paid this tribute after the death of Joachim NeubÃ¼ser\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nNeubÃ¼ser was much more than just the originator ofÂ GAP: a skilled computational group theorist himself, and an inspiring teacher. Indeed, when I wrote my book on permutation groups in the late\n1990\ns, he wrote me a long account of the trials and mis-steps in the classification of transitive subgroups of low-degree symmetric groups, and permitted me to quote it in the book\n(\nwhich I did\n)\n. ButÂ GAP, together with his students, make up his main legacy.",
