  "biografia": "Carl Siegel\n's father worked for the post office. Siegel entered the University of Berlin in\n1915\n, in the midst of World War I, and attended lectures by\nFrobenius\nand\nPlanck\n. Siegel wrote\n[\n15\n]\n:-\nBy conducting\n[\nbeginners' classes\n]\npersonally the professors could see, after only a few lectures, which of the students were the more gifted by the work they handed in, and the professors could direct their work accordingly. This was the way I myself first came into contact with my teachers\nFrobenius\nand\nPlanck\n...\nInitially his intention had been to study astronomy, but\nFrobenius\n's influence took him towards\nnumber theory\nwhich would became the main research topic of his career. In\n1917\n, however, he had to interrupt his studies when he was called for military service. Most certainly military life did not suit Siegel and he was eventually discharged from the army as one of their failures, for despite their best efforts they had failed to have him adapt to army life. One would have to believe that Siegel would have classed this as a success rather than a failure.\nAfter the war had ended, Siegel continued his studies at GÃ¶ttingen, beginning in\n1919\n. His doctoral dissertation at GÃ¶ttingen was supervised by\nEdmund Landau\nand Siegel then continued to study for his\nhabilitation\n. His dissertation, written in\n1920\n,\n[\n1\n]\n:-\n... was a landmark in the history of Diophantine approximations.\nIt extended an idea first noted by\nLiouville\n, then pushed forward by\nThue\nwho proved that, given a rational number\nr\nr\nr\nand any\ne\n>\n0\ne > 0\ne\n>\n0\nthere are only finitely many rational numbers\np\nq\n\\large\\frac{p}{q}\\normalsize\nq\np\nâ\n(\nin their lowest terms\n)\nsuch that\nâ£\nr\nâ\np\nq\nâ£\n|r - \\large\\frac{p}{q}\\normalsize |\nâ£\nr\nâ\nq\np\nâ\nâ£\nâ¤\n1\nq\n2\n+\n1\n+\ne\n\\large\\frac {1}{q^2+1+e}\nq\n2\n+\n1\n+\ne\n1\nâ\n.\nSiegel improved this by showing that there are only finitely many rational numbers\np\nq\n\\large\\frac{p}{q}\\normalsize\nq\np\nâ\nsuch that if\nr\nr\nr\nis an\nalgebraic number\nof degree\nn\nn\nn\nâ£\nr\nâ\np\nq\nâ£\nâ¤\n1\nq\nm\n|r - \\large\\frac{p}{q}\\normalsize | â¤ \\large\\frac{1}{q^{m}\\normalsize}\nâ£\nr\nâ\nq\np\nâ\nâ£\nâ¤\nq\nm\n1\nâ\n, where\nm\n=\n2\nâ\nn\nm = 2ân\nm\n=\n2\nâ\nn\n.\nSchÃ¶nflies\nhad been appointed as professor at the Johann-Wolfgang-Goethe-University of Frankfurt in\n1914\n, the year in which the new university opened. He was aged\n61\nwhen he was appointed and when he retired in\n1922\nSiegel was appointed as professor to succeed him at Frankfurt. Although\nSchÃ¶nflies\nspent the six years of his retirement in Frankfurt, his days as an active mathematician were over by the time Siegel took up the professorship. There were, however, several young mathematicians on the staff at Frankfurt who would with Siegel create an excellent centre for mathematics.\nHellinger\n, like\nSchÃ¶nflies\n, had been appointed as a professor to the new university of Frankfurt when it opened in\n1914\n, and\nSzÃ¡sz\nhad been appointed as a\nPrivatdozent\nin the same year.\nSzÃ¡sz\nwas promoted to professor in\n1921\n,\nEpstein\nwas appointed in\n1919\n, and\nDehn\nin\n1921\n. It was a strong and exciting department which Siegel joined in\n1922\n.\nThere were a number of activities on which the four mathematicians Siegel,\nHellinger\n,\nEpstein\n, and\nDehn\ncollaborated. One was the history of mathematics seminar instigated by\nDehn\nin\n1922\n. Siegel wrote in\n[\n15\n]\n:-\nAs I look back now, those communal hours in the seminar are some of the happiest memories of my life. Even then I enjoyed the activity which brought us together each Thursday afternoon from four to six. And later, when we had been scattered over the globe, I learned through disillusioning experiences elsewhere what rare good fortune it is to have academic colleagues working unselfishly together without thought to personal ambition, instead of just issuing directives from their lofty positions.\nThe history of mathematics seminar was to last for thirteen years. They made a rule that they would study all the mathematical works in their original languages and although this reduced the number of students who participated in the seminar, there was never less than six. They studied the works of mathematicians including\nEuclid\n,\nArchimedes\n,\nFibonacci\n,\nCardan\n,\nStevin\n,\nViÃ¨te\n,\nKepler\n,\nDesargues\n,\nDescartes\n,\nFermat\n,\nHuygens\n,\nBarrow\n, and\nGregory\n. The aim of the seminar was\n[\n5\n]\n:-\n... to increase the understanding of the participating students for the results presented in lectures and to provide the teachers with aesthetic satisfaction of examining the outstanding works of past times in close detail.\nThe history of mathematics seminar was not the only one which Siegel participated in at Frankfurt, for the professors organised also a proseminar and a seminar. Student numbers rapidly built up after Siegel was appointed. At first he taught only a few students and\n[\n15\n]\n:-\n... I remember having only two in one of the advanced courses. One day they were both late for class, having been delayed at the university bursar. When they arrived, they were shocked to find I had begun without them and had already filled a whole section of the blackboard.\nBy\n1928\nSiegel was teaching\n143\nstudents in the differential and integral calculus course, and had to put in many hours work correcting students exercises. It was at this time that the student numbers reached a maximum, then they began to drop again.\nOn\n30\nJanuary\n1933\nHitler came to power and on\n7\nApril\n1933\nthe Civil Service Law provided the means of removing Jewish teachers from the universities. This did not affect Siegel who was an Aryan\n(\nto use the terminology of the time which Siegel hated\n)\nand, at this stage it did not affect\nEpstein\n,\nHellinger\nor\nDehn\nwho, although Jewish, fell under a clause which exempted non-Aryans who had fought for Germany in World War I.\nSzÃ¡sz\n, however, was dismissed from his post. Although Siegel was not affected by the Civil Service Law, he hated the Nazi regime and this was the beginning of a very unhappy time for him.\nIn\n1935\nSiegel spent a year at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton in the United States. He returned to Frankfurt to find that the problems of his Jewish colleagues had become much worse. After decisions at the Nuremberg party congress in the autumn of\n1935\n,\nEpstein\n,\nHellinger\nand\nDehn\nwere forced from their posts. They remained in Frankfurt, unable to teach. In late\n1937\nSiegel accepted a professorship at GÃ¶ttingen and he moved there in early\n1938\n. At GÃ¶ttingen he\n[\n15\n]\n:-\n... led a somewhat retiring life.\nLife in GÃ¶ttingen was still influenced by the Nazi policies and mathematicians reacted in different ways to the political pressures. For example\nHasse\nin GÃ¶ttingen wanted to accept the habilitation thesis of his assistant, but Siegel and Herglotz felt that this was a political rather than mathematical decision by\nHasse\nand stopped the habilitation being accepted.\nThe Nazi regime had taken Germany to war in\n1939\nand Siegel felt that he could no longer remain in his native land. In early\n1940\nhe left Germany, lecturing first in Denmark and then in Norway. In March\n1940\nhe met up with\nDehn\nin Norway.\nDehn\nhad fled from Germany in fear of his life and was teaching in Trondheim when Siegel visited him. Siegel saw German merchant ships in the harbour and only later, having left Norway for the United States, did he discover that the ships he had seen were the advanced party of the German invasion force.\nSiegel described his time in the United States as\n[\n15\n]\n:-\n... self imposed exile in America.\nHe worked at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton from\n1940\nuntil\n1951\n, being appointed to a permanent professorship there in\n1946\n. However, in\n1951\nhe returned to Germany and again worked at GÃ¶ttingen for the rest of his career.\nThe paper\n[\n8\n]\nlists Siegel's impressive contributions to mathematics under seven headings. These are:\nApproximation of algebraic numbers by rationals and applications thereof to\nDiophantine equations\n.\nTranscendence questions, in particular values of certain functions at algebraic points.\nZeta functions\nincluding applications to class numbers.\nGeometry of numbers and its applications to\nalgebraic number theory\n.\nHardy\n-\nLittlewood\nmethod, including Waring-type problems for algebraic numbers.\nQuadratic forms\n: analytic theory and modular forms.\nCelestial mechanics.\nSiegel is especially famed for his work on the theory of numbers where he held an eminent role.\nSchneider\n, who was a student of Siegel's, gave three lectures on Siegel's contributions to number theory to the German Mathematical Union in\n1982\n. These are reproduced in\n[\n13\n]\nand describe Siegel's most important results in number theory. These include his improvement of\nThue\n's theorem, described above, given in his\n1920\ndissertation, and its application to certain polynomial Diophantine equations in two unknowns, proving an affine curve of genus at least\n1\nover a number field has only a finite number of integral points in\n1929\n. Perhaps his two part paper which appeared in\n1929\nis\n[\n1\n]\n:-\n.. his deepest and most original.\nIn the\n1929\npaper Siegel made a substantial contribution to transcendence theory, especially a new method for the algebraic independence of values of certain\nE\nE\nE\n-functions. He proved that if\nJ\n0\nJ^{0}\nJ\n0\nis the Bessel function of index\n0\n, then for any non-zero algebraic integer\nr\nr\nr\nhe showed that\nJ\n0\n(\nr\n)\nJ^{0}(r)\nJ\n0\n(\nr\n)\nis transcendental.\nHe had earlier than this in\n1922\n, written papers on the functional equation of\nDedekind\n's zeta functions of\nalgebraic number fields\nand in\n1921\n/\n23\nmade contributions to additive questions such as\nWaring\ntype problems for algebraic number fields. He made further contributions to this latter topic in\n1944\n. Siegel's research on the analytic theory of quadratic forms in\n1935\n/\n37\nwas of fundamental importance and he broke new ground in considering quadratic forms in which the coefficients were from an algebraic number field.\nKlingen, in\n[\n9\n]\n, discusses Siegel's contributions to complex analysis. In particular he studied automorphic functions in several complex variables, Siegel's modular functions, which have led to a much deeper understanding. In this general area Siegel considered the theory of discontinuous\ngroups\nand their fundamental domains, algebraic relations between modular functions and between modular forms, and\nFourier series\nof modular forms.\nSiegel's work in celestial mechanics, which came next to number theory in his list of favourite topics, is discussed by RÃ¼ssmann in\n[\n12\n]\n. The paper lists eight major contributions which Siegel made to the subject. He studied:\nthe\nn\nn\nn\n-body problem and the theorem of\nBruns\non algebraic integrals.\nthe restricted problem of three bodies and their integrals, which used the results Siegel had proved in\n(\ni\n)\n.\nthe orbit of the moon, again essentially a three-body problem. Siegel gave a much improved version of lunar theory as developed by\nHill\n.\nthe Lagrangian solutions for the three-body problem. Siegel developed general methods to determine periodic orbits near the equilibrium points.\nthe problem of small divisors, where Siegel first obtained convergence results.\nBirkhoff\nnormal forms. He examined\nBirkhoff\n's work on perturbation theory solutions for analytical Hamiltonian\ndifferential equations\nnear an equilibrium point using formal power series. Siegel gave examples of systems which did not possess convergent transformations into a normal form.\ncontributions to stability theory.\nAn interesting episode, which tells us a lot about Siegel's approach to mathematics, occurred in the\n1960\ns. Serge Lang published\nDiophantine geometry\nin\n1962\nand\nMordell\nwrote a critical review of it two years later. Siegel then wrote to\nMordell\n[\n11\n]\n:-\nWhen I first saw\n[\nLang's Diophantine geometry\n]\n, about a year ago, I was disgusted with the way in which my own contributions to the subject had been disfigured and made unintelligible. My feeling is very well expressed when you mention Rip van Winkle!\nThe whole style of the author contradicts the sense for simplicity and honesty which we admire in the works of the masters in number theory -\nLagrange\n,\nGauss\n, or on a smaller scale,\nHardy\n,\nLandau\n. Just now Lang has published another book on algebraic numbers which, in my opinion, is still worse than the former one. I see a pig broken into a beautiful garden and rooting up all flowers and trees.\nUnfortunately there are many \"fellow-travellers\" who have already disgraced a large part of algebra and function theory; however, until now, number theory had not been touched. These people remind me of the impudent behaviour of the national socialists who sang: \"Wir werden weiter marschieren, bis alles in Scherben zerfÃ¤llt!''\nâ\n(\nWe will march until everything falls to pieces!\n)\nI am afraid that mathematics will perish before the end of this century if the present trend for senseless abstraction - as I call it: theory of the empty set - cannot be blocked up. ...\nDieudonnÃ©\n, writes in\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nSiegel, who never married, devoted his life to research.\nBut\nDieudonnÃ©\nexplains why he believes that Siegel had few doctoral students:-\n... the perfection and thoroughness of his papers did not leave much room for improvement with the same technique,\n[\nand this\n]\ndiscouraged many research students because to do better than he required new methods. Siegel enjoyed teaching, however, even elementary courses, and he published textbooks on the theory of numbers, celestial mechanics, and the theory of functions of several complex variables.\nHe was awarded many honours, perhaps the most prestigious of which was the Wolf Prize in\n1978\n.",
