  "biografia": "Jerome Keisler\nwas the son of Harry Keisler\n(1909\n-\n1950)\nand Marion Siegel\n(1911\n-\n1996)\n, known as Minnie. Harry, born on\n21\nJuly\n1909\nin Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, was not given a middle name, so he changed his name to Harry Benton Keisler. He worked in the scrap steel industry, being a salesman at the time his son was born and becoming Vice President for the Dulien Steel Company. Minnie was born in the Bronx, New York. Harry and Minnie were married in Seattle, Washington on\n6\nMarch\n1934\n. Jerome had a younger sister, Arleen Jean Keisler, born in Seattle, Washington in\n1939\n. Harry Keisler began teaching his son mathematics when he was four years old. Sadly Harry Keisler died on\n14\nApril\n1950\nwhen Jerome was thirteen years old. When he was at high school, Jerome loved mathematics but did not think that he could ever pursue a career in that subject\n[\n6\n]\n:-\nOnce he attended college, however, he was fascinated by how much he could accomplish from reasoning with mathematics.\nJerome Keisler studied at the California Institute of Technology, graduating with the degree of Bachelor of Science in mathematics in\n1959\n. We note that even while an undergraduate, he was undertaking research and publishing Abstracts of his results in the\nNotices\nof the\nAmerican Mathematical Society\n. For example he published Abstracts of\nThe theory of models with generalized atomic formulas, I and II\nsubmitted\n6\nOctober\n1958\nand\nOn unions of relational systems\nsubmitted\n1\nMarch\n1959\n. These papers were introduced by\nOlga Taussky-Todd\nwho taught Keisler at the California Institute of Technology. Later in\n1959\nhe published in the\nNotices\nAbstracts of\nLimit reduced products\n,\nA mathematical characterization of elementary equivalence\n, and\nA characterization of Horn\nclasses all three introduced by\nRoger Lyndon\n.\nOn\n1\nMay\n1959\n, Keisler married Lois J Hoffman in San Diego, California; she was three years younger than her husband. They moved to the University of California, Berkeley, where he undertook research advised by\nAlfred Tarski\n.\nTarski\nhad been fortunate to be in the United States when World War II broke out in\n1939\nsince he was able to remain there and had been appointed to the University of California, Berkeley, in\n1942\n, becoming Professor of Mathematics in\n1949\n. His obituary in\nThe Times\ntells us about\nTarski\n's students at Berkeley:-\nHis seminars at Berkeley fast became a power-house of logic. His students, many of them now distinguished mathematicians, recall the awesome energy with which he would coax and cajole their best work out of them, always demanding the highest standards of clarity and precision.\nKeisler's progress was rapid and his first paper appeared in print in\n1960\n. This was a\n26\n-page paper entitled\nTheory of models with generalized atomic formulas\nwhich was published by the\nJournal of Symbolic Logic\n. In this paper he gave a necessary and sufficient condition for an elementary class to be characterized by a set of sentences having a prescribed number of alternations of quantifiers. The paper was submitted on\n28\nApril\n1959\nwhile he was still a student at the California Institute of Technology and this is the address on the paper. He gives the following acknowledgement:-\nThe author received many helpful suggestions and a great deal of encouragement in connection with this paper from C C Chang, Richard A Dean, and\nRoger C Lyndon\n.\nWe note that Chen Chung Chang\n(1927\n-\n2014)\ncollaborated with Keisler throughout his career and they wrote joint papers and books. Richard A Dean taught Keisler at the California Institute of Technology. Keisler was awarded a Ph.D. in\n1961\n, after only two years of research at Berkeley, after submitting his\n45\n-page thesis\nUltraproducts and elementary classes\n. He begins the Introduction to the thesis as follows:-\nIn the theory of models of the first order predicate logic with identity we study the relationship between notions from logic and purely mathematical objects, called relational systems, or\n(\nfirst order\n)\nstructures, A, consisting of a set A and a sequence of relations on A corresponding to the predicate symbols of the logic. In such studies some of the most useful methods are those which permit us to form structures which have certain semantical properties. For example, the completeness theorem permits us to form a structure which satisfies a given consistent set of sentences.\nHe gives the following Acknowledgement:-\nA number of interesting discussions with C C Chang, Dana Scott, Robert Vaught, and my thesis advisor\nAlfred Tarski\nwere of great value in the preparation of this manuscript.\nAfter the award of his Ph.D. in\n1961\n, Keisler was appointed as a mathematician at the Institute for Defense Analysis in Princeton, New Jersey. He worked there until he was appointed as an assistant professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in\n1962\n. He was promoted to associate professor in\n1964\nand in\n1967\nbecame a full professor serving in this position for\n15\nyears. In\n1982\n, Keisler was named William F Vilas professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He continued to work at the University of Wisconsin-Madison for the rest of his career, retiring in\n2002\nhaving reached the age of\n65\n.\nKeisler attended the International Congress of Mathematicians held in Stockholm in August\n1962\n. He travelled with his wife Lois J Keisler and they arrived back in New York on a flight from Oslo on\n23\nAugust\n1962\n. They gave their address at that time as Sunset Hill, Princeton, New Jersey. In\n1970\nhe was an invited plenary speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians held in Nice, France, giving the talk\nModel Theory\n. He began his talk as follows:-\nTwenty years ago,\nA Robinson\nand\nA Tarski\nlectured on the subject of model theory to the International Congress at Cambridge, Massachusetts. At that time the subject was just beginning, and only two real theorems were known. Since then progress has been so spectacular that today it takes years of graduate study to reach the frontier. In this lecture I will try to give an idea of what the subject is like and where it is going. Model theory is a combination of universal algebra and logic.\nKeisler has written a number of books, some of which have run to several editions. We give some details, including extracts of reviews and prefaces, at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nIn\n2018\nKeisler was presented with the Albert Nelson Marquis Lifetime Achievement Award by Marquis Who's Who. The citation reads:-\nMarquis Who's Who, the world's premier publisher of biographical profiles, is proud to present Howard Jerome Keisler, PhD, with the Albert Nelson Marquis Lifetime Achievement Award. An accomplished listee, Dr Keisler celebrates many years' experience in his professional network, and has been noted for achievements, leadership qualities, and the credentials and successes he has accrued in his field. As in all Marquis Who's Who biographical volumes, individuals profiled are selected on the basis of current reference value. Factors such as position, noteworthy accomplishments, visibility, and prominence in a field are all taken into account during the selection process. ...\nDr Keisler has made seminal contributions in mathematical logic, particularly in the areas of model theory and nonstandard analysis. He has authored or co-authored seven books in his field and more than\n130\narticles for scholarly journals. His published works include \"Model Theory for Infinitary Logic\" in\n1971\n, \"Model Theory\" with C C Chang in\n1973\n, in\n1990\n, and in\n2012\n, \"An Infinitesimal Approach to Stochastic Analysis\" in\n1984\n, \"Model Theory of Stochastic Processes\" with Sergio Fajardo in\n2002\n, and \"Elementary Calculus: An Infinitesimal Approach\" in\n1976\n, in\n1986\nand in\n2012\n. Dr Keisler is also a member and a former vice president of the Association of Symbolic Logic and a member of the\nAmerican Mathematical Society\n.\nAn elected fellow of the\nAmerican Mathematical Society\n, Dr Keisler accepted an Alfred P Sloan fellowship from\n1966\nto\n1968\n. From\n1976\nto\n1977\n, he completed a fellowship with the John Simon Guggenheim Foundation. Moreover, Dr Keisler has been selected for inclusion in many editions of Who's Who in America.\nIn recognition of outstanding contributions to his profession and the Marquis Who's Who community, Howard Jerome Keisler, PhD, has been featured on the Albert Nelson Marquis Lifetime Achievement website.\nAlthough Keisler retired in\n2002\n, he certainly did not ease up on his outstanding publishing record with, up to February\n2020\n, over\n40\npapers appearing in print from\n2003\nonwards.\nFinally let us note that Jerome and Lois Keisler's son Jeffrey M Keisler\n(\nborn\n1964)\nis a distinguished university professor. After the award of a BS with Honours and Distinction in Mathematics and Computer Science from the University of Wisconsin-Madison\n(1985)\n, he received a MBA with High Honours in Business Economics from the University of Chicago\n(1996)\nand a PhD in Decision Sciences from Harvard University\n(1992)\n. He is now\n(2020)\nProfessor of Management Information Systems at the University of Massachusetts Boston. Jeffrey Keisler has published papers jointly with his father Jerome Keisler; for example\nCraig interpolation for networks of sentences\n(2012)\nand\nObserving, reporting, and deciding in networks of sentences\n(2014)\n. Here is the Abstract of the\n2014\npaper:-\nIn prior work we considered networks of agents who prove facts from their knowledge bases and report them to their neighbours in their common languages in order to help a decider verify a single sentence. In report complete networks, the signatures of the agents and the links between agents are rich enough to verify any decider's sentence that can be proved from the combined knowledge base. This paper introduces a more general setting where new observations may be added to knowledge bases and the decider must choose a sentence from a set of alternatives. We consider the question of when it is possible to prepare in advance a finite plan to generate reports within the network. We obtain conditions under which such a plan exists and is guaranteed to produce the right choice under any new observations.",
