  "biografia": "Norman Levinson\n's family were very poor Russian Jewish immigrants to the United States. Norman, born in Lynn, Massachusetts just before World War I, was the son of a shoe factory worker there, who earned three dollars a week and whose education consisted of attending a yeshiva for a few years. Norman's mother was illiterate but, despite the poverty, she managed to feed Norman and his sister Pauline. Zipporah\n(\nFagi\n)\nLevinson, Norman's wife, wrote in\n[\n5\n]\n:-\nRelatives and friends would give\n[\nNorman's mother\n]\nworn hand-me-down clothes. She would take them apart, and using the undersides which didn't show any wear, would make clothes for her children and husband.\nDespite a childhood of desperate poverty, and an education that consisted of attending rundown vocation schools, Norman said of his childhood:-\nWe were very poor, but we didn't think of ourselves as poor.\nNorman's father changed jobs, working for Forbes Lithograph, and the family bought a little house in Revere. It had no bathroom, and was heated by a single oil stove in the kitchen. Norman's mother did a remarkable job of providing for the family, planting fruit trees and vegetables behind the house. With little else for food, she would walk over a kilometre each day to buy stale bread for the family which was sold at half price.\nNorman attended Revere High School but the family doctor said that as he suffered from rheumatic fever he should not take any physical exercise. These school years were not easy for Norman but he helped his fellow pupils with their homework which put him on good terms with them. These years had a lasting effect on Norman, however. They may have been the cause for him being very shy, and they certainly were the reason that he became a hypochondriac. To try to help the family finances, Norman worked in the evenings in a grocery store while studying at Revere High School.\nLevinson entered the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in\n1929\nbut he did not register for a mathematics degree, rather he studied for a degree in Electrical Engineering. In June\n1934\nhe was awarded a Bachelor of Science degree and a Master of Science degree, both in electrical engineering. However he had by this time taken twenty graduate courses in mathematics at MIT, almost all the graduate courses the mathematics department offered. In fact by this time, while still an electrical engineering student, he had written a thesis with\nNorbert Wiener\nand, according to the Head of Mathematics, had:-\n... results sufficient for a doctoral thesis of unusual excellence.\nThe turning point in Levinson's studies had come when he signed up for\nWiener\n's graduate course on\nFourier series and integrals\nin\n1933\n-\n34\n. Levinson described what happened\n(\nsee for example\n[\n6\n]\n)\n:-\nI became acquainted with\nWiener\nin September\n1933\n, while still a student of electrical engineering, when I enrolled in his graduate course. It was at that time really a seminar course. At that level he was a most stimulating teacher. He would actually carry on his research at the blackboard. As soon as I displayed a slight comprehension of what he was doing, he handed me the manuscript of\nPaley\n-\nWiener\nfor revision. I found a gap in a proof and proved a lemma to set it right.\nWiener\nthereupon sat down at his typewriter, typed my lemma, affixed my name and sent it off to a journal. A prominent professor does not often act as secretary for a young student. He convinced me to change my course from electrical engineering to mathematics.\nAfter the award of his Master's degree in electrical engineering, Levinson applied to MIT to begin studying for his doctorate in mathematics. However the Mathematics Department were convinced that he had already done sufficient for the Ph.D. before starting the course! Instead\nWiener\ntogether with Phillips, the Head of Mathematics, arranged for Levinson to receive an MIT Redfield Proctor Traveling Fellowship so that he could spend the year at Cambridge in England. He was assured that he would receive his doctorate on his return to MIT irrespective of any work he did in Cambridge. The attraction of Cambridge for Levinson was the fact the\nG H Hardy\n, one of the world's most respected mathematicians, taught there.\nArriving in Cambridge at the end of August he wrote back to MIT in January:-\nI have been researching along here at quite a rate in sheets of paper consumed per day. However, usually the end product of my effort warms my soul only by blazing up in the fireplace. So far my stay here has produced two completed papers and several semi-completed ones.\nThis is rather a remarkable statement, if we look beyond the modesty and the joke; for a young student four months into his doctoral studies to have written two papers and have several more underway is truly remarkable.\nRota\n, in\n[\n9\n]\n, makes a rather surprising statement about Levinson's year at Cambridge which we reproduce without comment:-\nNorman told me that the first thing he did when he arrived in England was to buy a new wardrobe for himself. His year in Cambridge was uneventful: he never even met Hardy, as a matter of fact he never had a high opinion of\nHardy\n, he thought\nLittlewood\nto be a stronger mathematician.\nWhen Levinson returned to MIT in\n1935\nhe was awarded a Doctor of Science degree for a thesis entitled\nNon-vanishing of a function\n. He then was awarded a National Research Council Fellowship which enabled him to spend two years at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton. At the Institute for Advanced Study, Levinson was attached to\nvon Neumann\nwho was to act as a supervisor, but Levinson was a fully independent research worker by this time and certainly did not need a supervisor.\nThe Great Depression began in\n1929\n, the year Levinson entered MIT, and by\n1932\none quarter of the workers in the United States were unemployed. As Levinson undertook his research at Princeton he felt that he had little prospects of gaining a university job, partly because of the high unemployment, but also because anti-Semitism in the United States at this time meant that Jewish mathematicians found it much harder than others to get posts. There was no shortage of high quality Jewish mathematicians, too, since by\n1937\nmany such people were fleeing from Germany and surrounding countries and emigrating to the United States. Levinson formed a plan to train as an actuary and try for a job with an insurance company after his Fellowship at Princeton ended.\nIf Levinson really had not met\nHardy\nduring his year at Cambridge, it was certainly\nHardy\nwho fought for Levinson to get a permanent job when he visited the United States. In the autumn of\n1936\nJesse Douglas\n, who was awarded one of the first\nFields Medals\nthat year, became ill and could not teach his courses at MIT. Levinson was an obvious person for them to hire and was recommended to them by\nWiener\nbut anti-Semitism at MIT tried to prevent such a move. The university's provost, Vannevar Bush, turned down\nWiener\n's recommendation that Levinson be offered a position as Instructor but\nHardy\n, on a visit to MIT, went with\nWiener\nto the provost's office to protest against the decision.\nHardy\nis reported to have said:-\nTell me, Mr Bush, do you think you're running an engineering school or a theological seminary? Is this the Massachusetts Institute of Theology? If it isn't, why not hire Levinson.\nLevinson was appointed as an Instructor at MIT in February\n1937\nhaving been released from his Fellowship by Princeton before its term was complete. He married Zipporah Wallman\n(\nknown to all as Fagi\n)\non\n11\nFebruary\n1938\nand their two daughters, Sylvia and Joan\n(\nZorza\n)\nwere born in\n1939\nand\n1941\n. Levinson was promoted to Assistant Professor in the year that his first daughter was born.\nIn\n1940\nLevinson published\nGap and density theorems\nin the\nAmerican Mathematical Society\nColloquium Publication Series. It was a great tribute to the young mathematician that he had been invited to write a book in a series which was reserved for distinguished senior mathematicians. The book contains his early researches on\nFourier\ntransforms in the complex domain which had developed from his study of the\nPaley\n-\nWiener\nbook which began his research career.\nGap and density theorems\n[\n2\n]\n:-\n... subsumes much of Levinson's brilliant early research in harmonic and complex analysis.\nMartin explains in\n[\n6\n]\nhow Levinson changed the direction of his research after the publication of this treatise in\n1940\n:-\nNorman decided to shift his field from gap and density theorems to non-linear\ndifferential equations\n, both ordinary and partial. I recall our talking about this decision in\n1940\n, and how difficult is was to move into this new field, and how hard Norman worked over a period of two or three years before he felt that he had enough mastery to obtain substantial results in this field; but this mastery he did achieve, and his outstanding contributions to non-linear differential equations were recognised officially in\n1954\nwhen the American Mathematical Society awarded Norman the\nBÃ´cher\nPrize.\nBy\n1954\nLevinson had been a professor for five years. He had been promoted to Associate Professor in\n1944\n, and to full Professor at MIT in\n1949\n. However his career nearly came to a premature end in the McCarthy era.\nLevinson believed in employment for all, fighting anti-Semitism, and fighting discrimination against blacks. He found that these were exactly the views of the American Communist Party which he therefore joined. When he learnt of the direction that Stalin had taken Communism in Russia, Levinson left the American Communist Party. However in\n1953\nhe, and two other colleagues at MIT, were forced to testify to the House Un-American Activities Committee. The Committee demanded that Levinson name other members of the American Communist Party but, although he agreed to talk freely about what he did as a member of the Party, he refused to name others since he knew the consequences that would have. He had already worked out in his own mind what he would do if fired by MIT, but a skilful lawyer saved him from this fate. It did mean some difficult years for Levinson and his family, but they came through them.\nLet us return to discuss further Levinson's mathematical contributions. In\n1955\nhe published another text which quickly became a classic. This was\nTheory of ordinary differential equations\n(\nwritten jointly with Earl Coddington\n)\nwhich\n[\n2\n]\n:-\n... has literally become the bible for students that helped train several generations of mathematicians, scientists and engineers since it was published in\n1955\n.\nLevinson wrote only two papers on time series, but these had a large impact. They had implications for geophysical signal processing\n(\nand signal processing in general\n)\nand they contributed to improved methods of oil exploration, particularly in off-shore oil fields.\nTo gain a full appreciation of Levinson's mathematical contribution we quote at length from the Preface to\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nThe deep and original ideas of Norman Levinson have had a lasting impact on fields as diverse as differential and\nintegral equations\n, harmonic, complex and stochastic analysis, and\nanalytic number theory\nduring more than half a century. Yet, the extent of his contributions has not always been fully recognized in the mathematics community. For example, the horseshoe mapping constructed by Stephen\nSmale\nin\n1960\nplayed a central role in the development of the modern theory of dynamical systems and chaos. The horseshoe map was directly stimulated by Levinson's research on forced periodic oscillations of the Van der Pol oscillator, and specifically by his seminal work initiated by\nCartwright\nand\nLittlewood\n. In other topics, Levinson provided the foundation for a rigorous theory of singularly perturbed differential equations. He also made fundamental contributions to inverse scattering theory by showing the connection between scattering data and spectral data, thus relating the famous\nGelfand\n-Levitan method to the inverse scattering problem for the\nSchrÃ¶dinger\nequation. He was the first to analyze and make explicit use of wave functions, now widely known as the Jost functions. Near the end of his life, Levinson returned to research in analytic number theory and made profound progress on the resolution of the\nRiemann hypothesis\n.\nFor a paper on number theory Levinson received the\n1971\nChauvenet\nPrize of the\nMathematical Association of America\n. Shortly before his death he wrote a series of important papers on the\nRiemann\nhypothesis arising from this fundamental number theory paper.\nE A Robinson, see\n[\n1\n]\n, writes:-\nLevinson ... was on the threshold of perhaps his greatest achievements in mathematics at the time of his death.\nAlthough Levinson had feared all his life that he would die of a heart attack, and was extremely careful with his diet in an attempt to avoid this fate, it was a brain tumour which lead to his death.\nRota\nwrites:-\nOne day shortly after his paper on the Riemann\nzeta function\nappeared, he knocked at the door, came in, and sat down. He looked pale and ill. He complained of a strong headache. ... Shortly afterwards, he entered Massachusetts General Hospital. ... in the August of that summer\n[\nI\n]\nvisited him ... His head was shaven, and red and black lines were drawn on it. ... I never saw him again.\nAfter his death the MIT Faculty prepared a tribute to Levinson. It read:-\nNorman Levinson was the heart of mathematics at MIT, a man who combined creative intellect of the highest order with human compassion and unremitting dedication to science and to excellence in its pursuit. Throughout the mathematical world the name of MIT and the name of Norman Levinson have been synonymous for many years. To those of us who were fortunate to have him as a friend and colleague, this is entirely fitting, because we are aware that, with extraordinary effectiveness and caring, he devoted forty six years of his life to mathematics and to this Institute.",
