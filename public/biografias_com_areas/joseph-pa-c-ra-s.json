  "biografia": "Joseph PÃ©rÃ¨s\nwas the son of the famous philosopher Jean PÃ©rÃ¨s who had studied at the Ãcole Normale SupÃ©rieure and was a professor of philosophy at the LycÃ©e in Grenoble. Jean PÃ©rÃ¨s was the author of the book\nL'Art et le RÃ©el, Essai de mÃ©ta-physique fondÃ©e sur l'esthÃ©tique\nâ\n(\nArt and the Real, Essay on meta-physics  based on aesthetics\n)\n(1898)\nand of several papers on philosophy. In\n1906\nJoseph entered the special class in mathematics at the LycÃ©e in Caen, the school where his father was at that time professor of philosophy. After one year of preparation at this LycÃ©e, Joseph sat the entrance examinations for the Ãcole Normale SupÃ©rieure and the Ãcole Polytechnique. He was offered a place at both prestigious institutions so then had to make a decision which to accept.\nJoseph, like his father, chose to study at the Ãcole Normale SupÃ©rieure in Paris, entering in\n1908\nand graduating three years later. At the Ãcole Normale SupÃ©rieure, the professors who had the most influence on PÃ©rÃ¨s were\nErnest Vessiot\n,\nÃmile Borel\nand\nJacques Hadamard\n. In his thesis he thanks these professors:-\n... to whom I owe so much, and who have constantly shown me the most affectionate kindness.\nHenri Villat writes\n[\n13\n]\n:-\nStrangely enough, he obtained, at his entrance, and then at his exit from the Ãcole Normale, the same rank which had been mine a few years before, a coincidence which obviously the calculus of probabilities rates as highly unlikely.\nPÃ©rÃ¨s graduated with his agrÃ©gÃ© in mathematics in\n1911\nand was awarded a scholarship to support him while he undertook research for his doctorate.\nÃmile Borel\nintroduced him to\nVito Volterra\nwhen\nVolterra\nmade one of his many journeys to France to promote scientific collaboration. PÃ©rÃ¨s went to Italy to work for his doctorate under\nVolterra\nand he expresses his thanks to Volterra in a dedication in his thesis:-\nThis thesis is a contribution to the study of the permutable functions which M\nVolterra\nhas introduced into Science. It was he who guided me at the beginning of my researches, and he who then encouraged me to pursue them; with him I found the most cordial reception at the University of Rome. May I be permitted, by dedicating this Memoir to him, to express my respectful gratitude for the extreme goodness with which he has given me so many proofs.\nIt was during this period, when he was completing work on his thesis, that PÃ©rÃ¨s married the daughter of LÃ©on Robin\n(1866\n-\n1947)\n, who was an historian of ancient philosophy and a leading expert on Plato. LÃ©on Robin was a professor of philosophy at the Sorbonne. After PÃ©rÃ¨s returned to France from Italy, he taught at the LycÃ©e at Montpellier and he was there when he submitted his thesis\nSur les fonctions permutable do Volterra\nâ\n(\nOn the permutable functions of Volterra\n)\non\n30\nJanuary\n1915\nto the Faculty of Sciences in Paris for the degree of Doctor of Mathematical Sciences. The thesis was seen and approved by\nPaul Appell\n, the Dean of the Faculty of Sciences, and sent for printing. PÃ©rÃ¨s was examined in May\n1915\nby three examiners,\nÃmile Borel\n(\nPresident\n)\n,\nErnest Vessiot\nand\nJacques Hadamard\n. Let us quote from PÃ©rÃ¨s's Conclusions at the end of his thesis:-\nAll the equations studied above belong to the general class of equations which can be formed from unknown functions and known functions by additions and compositions. We have developed two principal methods for solving them: the first consists in reducing them to a solvable equation by successive approximations, the reduction being entirely realized\n(\nChapter I, equations of paragraphs I and II\n)\n, or obtaining by derivation\n[\nVolterra\nequation of the first kind, equation\n(\ne\n)\nof Chapter III\n]\nand by change of unknown\n(\nChapter II\n)\n. The second method is to find the solution in the form\nâ\n(\ny\nâ\nx\n)\np\nÎ\np\n(\nx\n)\n\\sum  (y - x) ^{p} \\Pi _{p} (x)\nâ\n(\ny\nâ\nx\n)\np\nÎ\np\nâ\n(\nx\n)\nThe methods of this Chapter\n(\nChapter IV\n)\nbelong to this second type.\nPÃ©rÃ¨s and his wife had a son LÃ©on Joseph Jean Marie PÃ©rÃ¨s\n(1915\n-\n1998)\nwho was born in Montpellier while PÃ©rÃ¨s was teaching at the LycÃ©e there. PÃ©rÃ¨s taught at Montpellier until\n1919\n, then at Toulouse from\n1919\nto\n1920\n. He became an assistant lecturer at Strasbourg\n(1920\n-\n21)\nbefore being appointed Professor of Rational and Applied Mechanics at Marseilles in\n1921\n. It was during his time in Strasbourg that the direction of his research began to change and he began to be interested in applied mathematics problems in addition to the topics that he had studied for his doctorate but he never completely abandoned his original topic. For example he published\nLe parallÃ©lisme de M Levi-Civita et la courbure riemannienne\nâ\n(\nThe parallelism of  Levi-Civita and the Riemann curve\n)\nin\n1919\nand\nÃ propos de la notion de parallÃ©lisme dans une variÃ©tÃ© quelconque\nâ\n(\nConcerning the notion of parallelism in any variety\n)\nin\n1920\n. After his appointment to Marseilles he published papers on impact such as\nChoc entenant compte du frottement\nâ\n(\nImpact taking friction into account\n)\n(1923)\nand\nChoc de deux solides avec frottement\nâ\n(\nImpact of two solids with friction\n)\n(1923)\n. Another of his papers on impact was\nNote sur le choc en tenant compte du frottement de glissement\nâ\n(\nNote on impact taking into account the sliding friction\n)\n(1924)\nwritten jointly with Ãtienne Marie ElÃ©onor Delassus. Delassus, born on\n25\nMarch\n1868\nin Amiens, Somme, had studied at the Ãcole Normale SupÃ©rieure\n(\nclass of\n1888)\n, was awarded a doctorate in Mathematical Sciences from Paris in\n1895\n, and had been appointed professor at the Faculty of Sciences at Bordeaux in\n1913\n.\nCostabel writes that with his work on impact with friction\n[\n1\n]\n:-\n...\n[\nPÃ©rÃ¨s\n]\nachieved one of the last great successes of rational mechanics. The gift for theoretical speculation manifested in these investigations remained the mainspring of his work and of his influence, and the fruitfulness of both is explained by his openness to new ideas.\nFor a list of publications by PÃ©rÃ¨s, see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nIt was at Marseilles that PÃ©rÃ¨s's son, Jean-Marie PÃ©rÃ¨s, attended the LycÃ©e Thiers and the LycÃ©e Saint-Charles. In\n1931\n, at the age of sixteen, he received baccalaureates in mathematics and philosophy. Wishing to follow his father and grandfather, for two consecutive years he sat the entrance examination for the Ãcole Normale Superieure. However, he did not perform well enough to be offered a place. Despite this setback, Jean-Marie PÃ©rÃ¨s went on to become an outstanding zoologist and marine ecologist.\nAt Marseilles, PÃ©rÃ¨s founded an institute of fluid mechanics in\n1930\n. Pierre Perrier writes\n[\n11\n]\n:-\nPÃ©rÃ¨s received funding to open a laboratory for research in aerodynamics at the request of the French Defense Ministry. The Ministry wanted to increase research in aeronautics by creating a network of institutes for fluid mechanics, the first in Paris and the second in Marseille. In addition to experimental work on propeller blades in the new low-turbulence wind tunnel facility, PÃ©rÃ¨s hoped to extend to three dimensions the analog voltage and current equivalent measurements that are analogous to speed voltages in incompressible fluids surrounding subsonic aircraft in motion.\nHowever, he only remained at Marseilles for two years after this before he was offered a chair at the Sorbonne where he was appointed director of the Institute of Fluid Mechanics. At Marseilles he had taught an extremely talented young student Lucien ClÃ©ment Malavard\n(7\nOctober\n1910\n-\n2\nMarch\n1990)\n. Malavard was awarded a Master's Degree from the University of Marseille in\n1930\nand then started research for a PhD supervised by PÃ©rÃ¨s. When PÃ©rÃ¨s moved to Paris in\n1932\n, Malavard moved with him and in\n1934\nwas awarded a diploma in aeronautical engineering. They began publishing joint papers in\n1932\n, for example their joint papers\nSur les analogies Ã©lectrique en hydrodynamique\nâ\n(\nOn the electrical analogies in hydrodynamics\n)\n(1932)\n,\nTracÃ© des lignes de courant dans l'Ã©coulement d'Oseen autour d'un cercle\nâ\n(\nDrawing lines of current in the flow of Oseen around a circle\n)\n(1932)\n,\nApplication de la mÃ©thode Ã©lectrique Ã  un problÃ¨me concernant lÃ¡ile d'envergure finie\nâ\n(\nApplication of the electrical method to a problem concerning finite wingspan\n)\n(1932)\n, and\nSur un problÃ¨me concernant la thÃ©orie de l'aile d'envergure finie\nâ\n(\nOn a problem concerning  the theory of a wing of finite span\n)\n(1932)\nwere all published in that year.\nFor later joint papers of PÃ©rÃ¨s and Malavard see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nAt the Sorbonne he balanced his career between teaching and research being active in both while at the same time taking on some major administrative roles such as Dean of the Faculty of Science in Paris from\n1954\nto\n1961\n. However, he also taught at other major institutions: the Ãcole Polytechnique, the Ãcole Centrale, the Ãcole AÃ©ronautique, the Ãcole Normale de SÃ¨vres, and the Ãcole des Beaux-Arts.\nOn the research front he\n[\n11\n]\n:-\n... set out to build lift load distribution tables\n(\ncord and wing-tip\n)\nto provide data for structural calculations for new aircraft and thereby optimize their performance. This was achieved in the late\n1930\ns ...\nFor his research contributions he was awarded prizes from the\nAcadÃ©mie des Sciences\nin\n1932\n, again in\n1938\nand for yet a third time in\n1940\n. Two years after he received this third of these prizes he was elected to membership of the\nAcadÃ©mie des Sciences\n. He also\n[\n1\n]\n:-\n... fulfilled extensive responsibilities in several major national and international research organizations, notably the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique and the International Committee of Scientific Unions.\nPÃ©rÃ¨s' work on analysis and mechanics was always influenced by\nVolterra\n, extending results of\nVolterra\n's on\nintegral equations\n. His work in this area is now of relatively little importance since perhaps even for its day it was somewhat old fashioned. A joint collaboration between PÃ©rÃ¨s and\nVolterra\nled to the first volume of\nTheorie generale des fonctionnelles\nâ\n(\nGeneral theory of functionals\n)\npublished in\n1936\n. Although the project was intended to lead to further volumes only this one was ever published. This work is discussed in\n[\n9\n]\nwhere the author points out that the book belongs to an older tradition, being based on ideas introduced by\nVolterra\nhimself from\n1887\nonwards. By the time the work was published the ideas it contained were no longer in the mainstream of development of\nfunctional analysis\nsince topological and algebraic concepts introduced by\nBanach\n,\nvon Neumann\n,\nStone\nand others were determining the direction of the subject.\nPÃ©rÃ¨s's other books are\nLes sciences exactes\nâ\n(\nThe exact sciences\n)\n(1930)\n,\nCours de mÃ©canique des fluides\nâ\n(\nCourse of fluid mechanics\n)\n(1936)\n;\n(\nwith Lucien Malavard and Lucien Romani\n)\nTables numÃ©riques pour le calcul de la rÃ©partition des charges aÃ©rodynamiques suivant l'envergure d'une aile\nâ\n(\nNumerical tables for the calculation of the distribution of aerodynamic loads according to the span of a wing\n)\n(1936)\n, and\nMÃ©canique gÃ©nÃ©rale\nâ\n(\nMechanical engineering\n)\n(1953)\n. For extracts of reviews of these works see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nPerhaps the first of these,\nLes sciences exactes\nâ\n(\nThe exact sciences\n)\n(1930)\n, is the most surprising for it is a work on the history of mathematics. Although only a short text of less than\n200\npages, it covers the history of the subject up to the first decades of the\n20\nth century. After looking at the mathematics transmitted to Europe in the\n15\nth century, PÃ©rÃ¨s then looks at progress made up to the time of\nIsaac Newton\n. The next chapter considers the period from\nNewton\nto\nEuler\n, followed by a chapter covering the period from\n1780\nto\n1860\nwhere PÃ©rÃ¨s looks at the contributions of\nLagrange\n,\nLaplace\n,\nLegendre\n,\nCauchy\n,\nGalois\n,\nGauss\n,\nJacobi\n,\nRiemann\n, and\nWeierstrass\n. The final chapter considers the period\n1860\nup to the\n1920\ns when the text was written. We have said that this historical work is surprising given the great range of other research topics which interested PÃ©rÃ¨s at this time. However, those who knew PÃ©rÃ¨s would not have found it surprising since he was a very firm believer that understanding the history of mathematics was a great asset in undertaking research on other mathematical topics.\nThe analysis which PÃ©rÃ¨s and\nVolterra\nstudied proved important in developing ideas of mathematical physics rather than making breakthroughs in analysis itself and PÃ©rÃ¨s made good use of it in his applications. He studied the dynamics of viscous fluids and the theory of vortices with applications to aeronautics in mind. Costabel writes in\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nTo his scientific colleagues\n[\nPÃ©rÃ¨s\n]\nremained a circumspect theorist, animator, and promoter.\nIn addition to election to the Paris\nAcademy of Sciences\nin\n1942\n, he was also elected to the Academies in Rome, in Turin and in Washington. His remarkable work on the history of mathematics saw him elected to the AcadÃ©mie internationale d'Histoire des Sciences in\n1948\n. He was a founder committee member of the Histoire et de Philosophie des Sciences in\n1956\n.\nPÃ©rÃ¨s died on\n12\nFebruary\n1962\nat the age of\n71\n. He had gone into hospital for a minor operation so it was a great shock to his friends and colleagues that he passed away. They gathered in the chapel of the Sorbonne on\n16\nFebruary to pay tribute to a man who had made major contributions to mathematics and science, and had done outstanding work as dean for seven years. Henri Villat, who had been his teacher, colleague and friend, delivered 'Notice nÃ©crologique sur Joseph PÃ©rÃ¨s' to the Paris\nAcademy of Sciences\non\n26\nFebruary\n1962\n. This eloge was published as\n[\n13\n]\n.",
