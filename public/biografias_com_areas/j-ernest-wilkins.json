  "biografia": "J Ernest Wilkins Jr\nwas born into an African-American Methodist family, being the son of J Ernest Wilkins Sr and Lucile Beatrice Robinson. His father J Ernest Wilkins Sr was a lawyer who went on to become President of the Cook County Bar Association in the early\n1940\ns\n(\nCook County is in northeastern Illinois and Chicago is in that County\n)\n, and Assistant Secretary of Labor in the Eisenhower administration of the\n1950\ns. His mother Lucile Robinson had been educated to the level of a Master's Degree and was trained as a schoolteacher. In\n[\n6\n]\nthe strong influence of his parents is described:-\nResponding to the influence, nurture and guidance of his parents, and developing his talents, he achieved much.\nWilkins entered the University of Chicago in\n1936\nwhen only\n13\nyears old and in so doing he became the youngest ever student at that university. His university career was remarkable and he received much publicity when he graduated with his A.B. in mathematics from the University of Chicago in\n1940\nat the age of only\n17\nyears. He then continued to study mathematics at Chicago for his Master's Degree and in the following year he was awarded an M.S. He then continued with his doctoral studies at Chicago and submitted his dissertation\nMultiple Integral Problems in Parametric Form in the Calculus of Variations\nwhich led to his being awarded a Ph.D. in December\n1942\n, only a few days after his\n19\nth\nbirthday.\nFew teenagers can have won a scholarship and studied at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton but this is exactly what Wilkins did in\n1942\nwith a Rosenwald Scholarship. He wrote his first papers in\n1942\n, both on geometry, and they were published in\n1943\n. They are\nThe first canonical pencil\nand\nA special class of surfaces in projective differential geometry\nboth published in\nDuke Mathematical Journal\n. In the first he gives certain geometric definitions for lines of the first canonical pencil through a point of a nonruled surface. In the second he considers a certain class of surfaces and expresses characteristic properties of these surfaces in terms of standard projective elements.\nIn\n1943\n-\n44\nWilkins taught at the Tuskegee Institute, where most of the students were black. This was the first year that this Institute offered graduate-level instruction\n(\nit is now called Tuskegee University\n)\n. He then returned to the University of Chicago where he worked on the Manhattan Project in the Metallurgical Laboratory from\n1944\nto\n1946\n. The only method for the production of the fissionable material plutonium\n239\n, required for making a nuclear bomb, was being developed in this Laboratory under the direction of Arthur Holly Compton and\nEnrico Fermi\n.\nWilkins continued to produce a remarkable number of mathematical papers on a wide variety of different topics. In\n1944\nfour of his papers appeared:\nOn the growth of solutions of linear differential equations; Definitely self-conjugate adjoint integral equations; Multiple integral problems in parametric form in the calculus of variations\n; and\nA note on skewness and kurtosis\n. The last of these is on statistics. In the following year he published\nThe differential difference equation for epidemics\nin the\nBulletin of Mathematical Biophysics\n.\nAfter leaving the Manhattan Project in\n1946\n, Wilkins worked in industry. He was a mathematician at the American Optical Company in Buffalo, New York from\n1946\nto\n1950\n. During this time he married Gloria Stewart in\n1947\nthey had two children, Sharon and J. Ernest III. From\n1950\nhe worked as a mathematician at the United Nuclear Corporation of America in White Plains, New York for ten years. He became Manager of the Mathematics and Physics department there in\n1955\n, and then later Manager of Research and Development. It was during this time that Wilkins earned himself further degrees when he was awarded a Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering from New York University in\n1957\n, and a Master of Mechanical Engineering three years later.\nAfter this Wilkins held a number of academic and non-academic appointments. He worked at the General Atomic Company in San Diego in the\n1960\ns and in the\n1970\ns he was appointed to Howard University as Distinguished Professor of Applied Mathematical Physics. He established a Ph.D. programme in mathematics at Howard University and in doinf so it became the first traditional Black University to have such a programme.\nFrom\n1977\nto\n1984\nWilkins worked at EG&G Idaho, becoming Vice President and Deputy General Manager for Science and Engineering. Then from\n1984\nhe spent the last year before he officially retired as a Fellow at the Argonne National Laboratory of the U.S. Department of Energy in Argonne, Illinois which carries out basic research and development of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. He remained a consultant at the Argonne National Laboratory after he retired in\n1985\n. He became Distinguished Professor of Applied Mathematics and Mathematical Physics at Clark Atlanta University in\n1990\n.\nWe have looked above at some of the pure mathematical topics which Wilkins looked at early in his career. He has continued to produce mathematics papers and he has over\n50\npapers on mathematics and its applications. He also wrote papers on nuclear engineering and optics. His work on the penetration of gamma rays published in\n1953\nin the\nPhysical Review\nis used in the design of nuclear reactors and radiation shields:-\nHe developed mathematical models by which the amount of gamma radiation absorbed by a given material can be calculated. This technique of calculating radiative absorption is widely used among researchers in space and nuclear science projects.\nOther work which he has done has been related to heat transfer and in January\n1992\nhe was invited to give a joint\nAmerican Mathematical Society\n-\nMathematical Association of America\nlecture in Baltimore, Maryland. The\nAmerican Mathematical Society\nhas published a videocassette of this lecture and an interview. Here is an extract from the description:-\nWilkins has worked on a variety of mathematical problems throughout his distinguished career. A member of the National Academy of Engineering who received his doctorate in mathematics from the University of Chicago at the age of nineteen, Wilkins has worked in academia, industry, and government. ... In the interview, Wilkins describes some of the mathematical problems he has worked on and discusses some of the difficulties in trying to improve the participation of members of underrepresented groups in science and mathematics. His lecture explores a fascinating problem about heat transfer that arises in a variety of settings. With any heat engine, it is necessary to expel heat to the surroundings. One way to do this is to attach 'fins' to the outer wall of the engine. The shape of the fins has a large impact on how efficiently they are able to expel heat. Wilkins examines the mathematical aspects of determining the optimal shape of such fins.\nWilkins has received a large number of honours for his work. He was elected to: the American Association for the Advancement of Science\n(1956)\n; a Fellowship of the American Nuclear Society\n(1964)\n; the National Academy of Engineering\n(1976)\n; and Honorary membership of the National Association of Mathematicians\n(1994)\n. He served as President of the American Nuclear Society in\n1974\n-\n75\nand on the Council of the\nAmerican Mathematical Society\nfrom\n1975\nto\n77\n.\nHe was awarded the Outstanding Civilian Service Medal by the U.S. Army in\n1980\n.",
