  "biografia": "Ruan Yuan\nis also known as\nJuan Yuan.\nHe came from a distinguished Yangzhou family, with his grandfather having been Major General of Hunan province. The city of Yangzhou where Ruan was born is about halfway between Nanjing and Shanghai. It is in Jiangsu province which is bordered to the east by the Yellow Sea. Ruan obtained his master's degree in\n1786\nand, three years later, passed the civil service examinations and was appointed to the Hanlin Imperial Academy, the highest academic institution in China. We should note that this put Ruan in a position of authority since scholars there acted as advisors to the emperor and as his confidential secretaries.\nPerhaps we should say a little about what was involved in Ruan Yuan's education. The Academies basically trained students for examinations and the most advanced of these, the civil service examinations, were very much based on the ancient Chinese classics. The underlying philosophy was that of Confucianism as interpreted in commentaries by Cheng Yi and Zhu Xi in the\n11\nth\nand\n12\nth\ncenturies. To achieve the level which Ruan Yuan achieved required many years of study and he would have been a very elite scholar of Confucianism. He was then in a position to carry out duties at the Hanlin Academy where scholars worked on new interpretations of the Confucian Classics as well as keeping historical records, and preparing encyclopaedias recording as complete an account of knowledge as they could.\nRuan Yuan did not follow the traditional Neo-Confucian beliefs which were based on the commentaries on the classic texts by Cheng Yi and Zhu Xi. Rather he believed in evidential studies which believed that truth was best achieved by studying the classics themselves, and older commentaries on them. This approach, also known as Han Learning, had gained favour and led to huge efforts being put into collecting ancient works. Starting in\n1772\n, when Ruan Yuan was a young boy, the Chinese Emperor Qianlong organised major searches for lost texts. Experts in textual analysis studied the texts while other experts tried to reconstruct lost texts from quotations in surviving works.\nFrom\n1790\nRuan worked for the Hanlin Imperial Academy. In\n1791\nhe wrote the\nVerse of astronomer Zhang Heng\n. This work was on the calendarist and constructor of armillary sphere who lived from\n78\nto\n139\nAD. Ruan's career as a government official led to him holding a variety of offices such as that of a minister in the Education Department of Shandong province from\n1793\nto\n1795\nwhen he took up a similar post in Hangzhou in the Education Department of Zhejiang province. It was while he held this post that Ruan began his most famous work, namely the\nChouren zhuan\nor\nBiographies of astronomers and mathematicians\n.\nIn this work Ruan put forward the idea, which had been gaining credence in China for some time, that all Western sciences were of Chinese origin. The book suggests that it was difficult to separate astronomers and mathematicians, yet this seems not to be strictly accurate for Ruan includes as mathematicians those involved in computing the calendar, engineers, geographers, economists, and more surprisingly, some poets and musicians. It was not a work which he undertook alone, for colleagues such as\nLi Rui\nassisted him. The work consists of\n46\nchapters containing biographies of\n275\nChinese and\n41\nWestern \"mathematicians\". The biographies are certainly not as interesting as one might hope, mostly simply listing administrative and academic titles. More interesting are the numerous quotations from the works of the scientists whose biographies are given. Martzloff notes that a studies of the European mathematicians included in the work\n[\n2\n]\n:-\n... confirm the importance of Jesuit and Protestant missionaries. They also reveal, at various levels, some limitations and obstacles faced by astronomy and mathematics in the process of transmission from Western countries to China. For example, European names of persons were not always rendered consistently ...\nExamples of these difficulties are illustrated by the fact that\nCopernicus\nis given two different names in Chinese and given two separate biographies without it being recognised that they are of the same person. A similar error occurs with\nViÃ¨te\n. Again it is not surprising, if the length of the entry in any way indicates importance, that certain biographies look strange. For example\nNewton\nmerits\n11\nlines, against\n74\nlines for\nMatteo Ricci\nand\n22\nlines for Auguste Lendy, a British Captain. However\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nDespite obvious limitations and misrepresentations, Western astronomy and mathematics made accessible to Chinese readers, was none the less, for the most part, based on significant excerpts from texts of primary importance such as\nPtolemy\n's Almagest\nâ\n(\nThe major thesis: from the Arabic 'al-majisti' -- the Arabic translation of the Greek 'Mathematike Syntaxis' later translated into Latin as 'Magna Syntaxis'\n)\n,\nCopernicus\n's De revolutionibus or\nEuclid\n's Elements and never on mythical accounts. That was all that Ruan Yuan needed to bring to the fore \"the strong and weak points\" of both sciences in order to prepare a future synthesis.\nWhile still working on this major compilation of biographies of mathematicians, he edited the\nDictionary of Old Literature\n(1797)\n. The\nBiographies of astronomers and mathematicians\nwas published two years later in\n1799\n. In this year Ruan Yuan was appointed a professor of mathematics in the Imperial Academy as well as holding a number of posts in government departments. In\n1800\nhe was appointed governor of the province of Zhejiang\n(\nor Chekiang\n)\n, a coastal province bounded by the East China Sea. In addition to his political career, he continued his scholarly pursuits. He wrote the foreword to the\nTi Chhiu Thu Shuo\n(\nAn Illustrated Account of the Earth\n)\nby Chhien Ta-hsin in about\n1800\n. In it Ruan advised the readers of the book not to follow the Copernican theory just because of its \"newness\". He also combined his administrative and academic interests when he founded the Gujing jingshe\n(\nSchool of Classical Literature\n)\n. The school was set up with an innovative curriculum, and literature, astronomy, geometry and mathematics were taught there.\nHe continued to edit, catalogue and collect books and his career moved forward when he was appointed Chancellor of Henan province in\n1806\n. An incident occurred in\n1809\nwhich somehow involved the examination procedure and since Ruan Yuan was responsible be was demoted. Sent to the Hanlin Imperial Academy as a rather lowly scholar, he continued his research into ancient texts, being promoted to a researcher in the Historical Library, and then in\n1810\nhe became director of the Library. Slowly he made his way back up to high office, becoming Governor of Jiangxi province in\n1814\n. Around this time he edited the\nCommentaries to the Thirteen Classics\nand organised its printing.\nRuan, in order to further his research, always sought out ancient texts and information from inscriptions, and interviewed leading citizens wherever he was appointed. An example is the following.\nZhu Shijie\nwrote the\nSijuan yujian\n(\nJade mirror of the four unknowns\n)\nbut the work was lost during the latter part of the\n18\nth\ncentury and was not found by Ruan Yuan when he compiled his\nBiographies of astronomers and mathematicians\nin\n1799\n. However some years later he found a copy. He made a hand written copy which was sent to\nLi Rui\nfor editing but\nLi Rui\ndied before the work could be completed. Ruan's hand written copy was eventually printed.\nMore information about the\nJade mirror of the four unknowns\nis at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nIn\n1817\nRuan Yuan reached his highest position of importance when he was appointed Grand Governor of the two Guangzhou, so becoming governor of the two provinces of Guangdong and Guangxi in southern China. It was in the city of Guangzhou that Ruan Yuan founded his most famous academy the Xuehaitang, meaning the Sea of Learning Hall. At first he organised examinations in \"ancient learning\" in buildings which already housed an existing academy in Guangdong. Then in\n1824\nhe selected a site for new academy buildings on a hill just inside the northern city wall of Guangdong. That the Xuehaitang should be on a hill was significant for he intended that the people should look up to the place of learning. Building was complete in the following year and Ruan himself set the first examination essays. The Xuehaitang Academy, designed to promote evidential studies and Han Learning, went on to achieve the high aims of its founder.\nThe Xuehaitang Academy had only been operating from its new buildings for about a year when Ruan moved again, for in\n1826\nhe was appointed Grand Governor of Yunnan and Guizhou. He went on to reach extremely high office when he was appointed Grand Secretary in\n1835\n. He retired in\n1838\n.\nWe should mention another of Ruan's scholarly interests, namely that he was an avid collector of bronze ritual vessels and is said to have owned over\n460\nof these which had been made between\n1600\nBC and\n220\nAD. He was not simply collecting these historic vessels for their own sake, for he studied the inscriptions on them and, in\n1804\n, published a book which reproduced many of them. This study made him a leading authority on calligraphy and his book on the inscriptions was a major influence on the study of calligraphy throughout the\n19\nth\ncentury.\nFinally let us note the importance of Ruan's\nBiographies of astronomers and mathematicians\nin Chinese scholarship. It represented the integration of the mathematical sciences with evidential studies and, after its publication, mathematical study was no longer independent of classical studies. The work was republished at least six times up to\n1955\n. Further chapters were added as supplements in\n1840\n, in\n1886\n, and in\n1898\n.",
