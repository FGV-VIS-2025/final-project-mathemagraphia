  "biografia": "Thomas Kirkman\npublished over\n60\nsubstantial mathematical papers and many more minor ones. He solved the problem of 'Steiner triples' in\n1846\nin\nOn a Problem in Combinatorics\n,\n6\nyears before\nSteiner\nproposed it. He also constructed finite projective planes.\nThomas attended the grammar school in Bolton where he was taught Greek and Latin but no mathematics. He did well at school but although his schoolmaster and the vicar saw that he was a potential Cambridge fellow, Thomas's father could not be persuaded and Thomas was forced to leave school at the age of\n14\n. He worked in his father's office, continuing his study of Greek and Latin in his own time and extending his knowledge of languages by also learning French and German.\nAfter\n9\nyears working in the office, Thomas went against his father's wishes and he entered Trinity College Dublin to study mathematics, philosophy, classics and science for his B.A. On returning to England in\n1835\nhe entered the Church of England. He spent five years as a curate, first in Bury, then in Lymm. By\n1839\nhe became vicar in the Parish of Southworth in Lancashire, a position he held for\n52\nyears.\nHe married Eliza Anne Young. They had one son, William\n(\nborn\n1843)\nand two daughters, Mary Eliza\n(\nborn\n1847)\nand Katherine\n(\nborn\n1855)\n.\nAs a graduate of Dublin University, Kirkman was naturally interested when\nHamilton\npublished his work on\nquaternions\n. Kirkman's interest in mathematics was rapidly increasing and his first paper was presented in\n1846\nwhen he was\n40\nyears old. It answered a problem which appeared in the\nLady's and Gentleman's Diary\nof\n1845\nand shows the existence of 'Steiner systems' seven years before\nSteiner\n's article which asked whether such systems existed. This work of Kirkman appeared in the\nCambridge and Dublin Mathematical Journal\n. After\nSteiner\nasked his question, a solution was given by M Reiss in\n1859\n. Kirkman sarcastically wrote\n..... how did the Cambridge and Dublin Mathematical Journal Vol II p.\n191\n, contrive to steal so much from a later paper in\nCrelle\n's Journal Vol LVI p.\n326\non exactly the same problem in combinatorics?\nDespite Kirkman's clear priority, we call such systems today 'Steiner systems' and not 'Kirkman systems'.\nIn\n1848\nKirkman published a work, described by\nDe Morgan\nas\nthe most curious crochet I ever saw\nin which Kirkman attempted to make mathematical formulae more memorable by asking the student\n...to teach them to your ear and to your tongue, each of which has a memory of its own, by saying them again and again with a sing-song repetition...\nThe book was not popular but it is fair to say that school teaching of mathematics today sometimes resorts to similar memory aids.\nKirkman then investigated generalisations of the quaternions. For example the\nCayley\nnumbers and generalisations are discussed. He also at this time examined certain questions in geometry. He examined points of congruence of\nPascal\nlines and his work on this area came to be part of standard texts such as\nSalmon\n's\nConics\n.\nKirkman is best known for the Fifteen Schoolgirls Problem. He published this in the\nLady's and Gentleman's Diary\nof\n1850\n.\nFifteen young ladies of a school walk out three abreast for seven days in succession: it is required to arrange them daily so that no two shall walk abreast more than once.\nThe solution to the Fifteen Schoolgirls Problem is not particularly hard.\nCayley\npublished a solution first, then Kirkman published his own solution, which of course he knew before asking the question.\nSylvester\nalso studied aspects of this problem and later disputed with Kirkman on who had thought of it first.\nThere is a more general problem of when\nn\nn\nn\nschoolgirls can be arranged into\n1\n3\nn\n\\large\\frac{1}{3}\\normalsize n\n3\n1\nâ\nn\ntriples on each of\n1\n2\n(\nn\nâ\n1\n)\n\\large\\frac{1}{2}\\normalsize (n - 1)\n2\n1\nâ\n(\nn\nâ\n1\n)\ndays so that no two are in the same triple more than once. Clearly\nn\nn\nn\nmust be congruent to\n3\nmodulo\n6\nif such a set with\nn\nn\nn\nelements exists, but it was not until a paper in\n1971\nthat it was proved that such an arrangement is possible for every such\nn\nn\nn\n.\nAs Biggs comments in\n[\n2\n]\nregarding the Fifteen Schoolgirls Problem,\nIt is unfortunate that such a trifle should overshadow the many more significant contributions which its author was to make to mathematics. Nevertheless it is his most lasting memorial.\nFrom\n1853\nKirkman began a large piece of work on the enumeration of polyhedra, publishing many major papers in the\nRoyal Society\n. Kirkman became a Fellow of the\nRoyal Society\nin\n1857\n, mainly for this work on polyhedra which had been communicated to the\nRoyal Society\nby\nCayley\n.\nOn seeing that the\nAcadÃ©mie des Sciences of Paris\nwere awarding a prize for the study of '\ngroup theory\n' in\n1860\n, Kirkman decided to enter. This meant that he had just two years to become an expert in group theory. Indeed he achieved this and submitted a memoir of high quality. Three memoirs were submitted, the other two by\nÃmile Mathieu\nand\nJordan\n. The three submissions were praised but no prize awarded.\nKirkman continued to work on group theory, his last paper on the subject being\nThe complete theory of groups\n(1863)\n. The paper, which is an abstract of his Grand Prize Memoir, gives a recursive method for compiling lists of transitive groups and a complete list of transitive groups of degree â¤\n10\nis given.\nKirkman also planned to enter for the Grand Prix of the\nAcadÃ©mie des Sciences\nof\n1861\non the topic of polyhedra. However although much of this work had been completed, he changed his mind after his disappointment in the\n1860\ncompetition. He submitted a long work of\n21\nsections on polyhedra to the\nRoyal Society\nin\n1862\n. They decided to publish only the first\n2\nsections which themselves take up over\n40\npages of the\nProceedings\n. Again disappointed, Kirkman blamed\nCayley\nand wrote to\nJohn Herschel\nsuggesting\nCayley\nwanted to prevent publication because he had a paper of his own on polyhedra.\nKirkman continued to work on combinatorial questions. Then in\n1884\n, at the age of\n78\n, he published his first paper on\nknots\n. This was followed by a series of papers. In joint work with\nTait\nthey produced tables of knots with\n8\n,\n9\nand\n10\ncrossings.\nKirkman continued to study mathematics until his\n89\nth\nyear sending questions and solutions to the\nEducational Times\nup to a few months before his death.",
