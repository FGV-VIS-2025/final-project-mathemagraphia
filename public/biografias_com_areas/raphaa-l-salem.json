  "biografia": "RaphaÃ«l Salem\nwas born in Saloniki,\n(\nnow in Greece\n)\nto Jewish parents of Spanish origin. His father, Emmanuel Salem, was a well known lawyer who dealt with international problems while his mother was FortunÃ©e Salem. RaphaÃ«l was brought up in a truly international atmosphere for he lived in the Ottoman Empire, in a Jewish family who followed the Spanish traditions of their ancestors but spoke Italian and French at home. From this mixture of influences it is perhaps surprising that he attended an Italian school in Saloniki.\nWhen Salem was\n15\nyears old, his family moved to France and set up home in Paris. Salem attended the LycÃ©e\nCondorcet\nfor two years and then entered the Law Faculty of the University of Paris. It is not entirely clear how much the choice of law was that of Salem or that of his father. Certainly Salem's father wished his son to follow in his footsteps, and another factor here is that Salem always had a great respect for his father. It may well have been, therefore, that he did not take this course of study unwillingly, but at the same time it was clear that his interests were not in law but rather they were in mathematics and engineering.\nOf course there were few better places in the world to study mathematics than Paris, and Salem was soon taking mathematics courses with\nHadamard\n. The tension between his interests and his official course of study became greater as the course progressed. He received his law degree, graduating as LicenciÃ© et laurÃ©at in\n1919\n. He even began working for a doctorate in law but quickly decided that he had to change direction to science, which he had been studying for years in parallel to his work in law.\nHe received his LicenciÃ© Ã¨s sciences from the Sorbonne, also in\n1919\n, then worked for a degree in engineering. He received the degree of IngÃ©nieur des Arts et Manufactures from the Ãcole Centrale in\n1921\n. Now, having made the change away from law to science and engineering one might have expected Salem to seek a profession using these qualifications, but in fact he went into banking. This again may well have been as a result as pressure from his family or he may just have been happy to make money in banking while he regarded mathematics as a hobby to enjoy. Whenever he had free time in the evenings he worked on\nFourier\nseries, a topic which interested him throughout his life.\nHe worked for the Banque de Paris et des Pays-Bas from\n1921\n. In\n1923\nhe married Adriana and they had a daughter and two sons.\nZygmund\nwrites in\n[\n3\n]\n:-\nIn spite of his absorbing career Salem's interest in mathematics, which he acquired in his early studies, grew stronger and with time developed into an interest in mathematical research. He was spending on it most of his spare time, working mainly in the evenings. He became attracted to\nFourier\nseries, and the interest in the subject remained undiminished throughout his life. ... Although he read some of the current literature on\nFourier series\n, he apparently worked all alone ...\nHe did have some connections with Paris mathematicians, however, particularly with\nDenjoy\nwho may have influenced him towards\nFourier\nseries. His career in the bank progressed well and in\n1938\nhe became one of the managers of the Banque de Paris et des Pays-Bas. It was around this time, with a deteriorating political situation, that Salem finally made the decision to change career and become a mathematician.\nDenjoy\nwas certainly a factor in this decision, for he well realised Salem's potential as a mathematician and tried to persuade him to take a doctorate in mathematics. Another factor was the arrival of\nMarcinkiewicz\nin Paris in the spring of\n1939\n. Salem collaborated with this brilliant young Polish mathematician and of the mathematics papers he wrote while working for the bank, the one he wrote with\nMarcinkiewicz\nwas his only joint work.\nWorld War II broke out in September\n1939\n. Salem was called up for military work and attached to the DeuxiÃ¨me Bureau of the General Staff of the French Army. He had already taken\nDenjoy\n's advice and submitted his published papers, with some minor improvements, for a doctorate, and this was awarded in\n1940\n. As part of his military duties, Salem was sent to England to assist the Head of the Franco-British Coordination Committee but he was demobilised in June\n1940\n. By this time his family had managed to escape from France and they were in Canada. Salem left England in the autumn of\n1940\nand emigrated to the United States where he settled in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He went to Cambridge, Massachusetts via Canada where he spent a short time and met up with his family. In\n1941\n, he was appointed as a lecturer in mathematics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\nIt was very fortunate for Salem that he had obtained his doctorate in mathematics in the previous year from the University of Paris. It is hard to see how he would have been appointed without this mathematics qualification for he had no experience as a lecturer. This did not seem a problem, however, for\n[\n3\n]\n:-\n.. he was a born teacher and he enjoyed teaching though initially it was an effort for him to teach in English. He had a style of his own which combined verve and naturalness, precision and elegance. The way he could explain essential things without going into calculation were always admired by people attending his lectures and appreciating the difficulties inherent in mathematical presentations.\nHe was in the right place to carry on with his interest in\nFourier\nseries, and he collaborated on this topic with\nNorbert Wiener\nand\nZygmund\n(\nwith whom he wrote joint papers\n)\n.\nZygmund\n, reviewing\n[\n2\n]\n, puts Salem's contributions to\nFourier\nseries into perspective:-\nFor the last few decades two problems were central in the field: convergence almost everywhere of Fourier series and the nature of the sets of uniqueness for trigonometric series. With recent results ... the first problem is essentially solved. But the second problem still challenges, in spite of progress here. Much of this progress is due to\n[\nSalem\n]\nand people influenced by his ideas, and acquaintance with his work seems to be a prerequisite for those who would like to contribute to the solution of the problem. Another direction in which\n[\nSalem\n]\ndid a lot was applications of the\ncalculus of probability\nto\nFourier series\nand, curiously enough, this has connection with problems of uniqueness. Moreover, it seem that, far from being incidental, as it might have appeared some\n30\nor so years ago, the calculus of probability is becoming a standard method of attacking problems of trigonometric series. Going through the papers of\n[\nSalem\n]\none sees this growing role of the calculus of probability. Incidentally, the reader will greatly appreciate the elegance and lucidity of\n[\nSalem's\n]\nstyle.\nWe should also note that Salem introduced the idea of a random measure into\nharmonic analysis\n. This began an area of research which is still very active today.\nReturning to details of Salem's life we should emphasise how difficult the war years were for him. His father died in Paris in\n1940\nwhile his mother, his sister, his sister's husband, and his sister's son, were all arrested and deported by the Nazis to a concentration camp where they died. Salem's older son however, survived the war. He enlisted in the free French Forces and took part in Allied landings in the South of France in\n1944\n.\nSalem was rapidly promoted at MIT where he became an assistant professor in\n1945\n, and an associate professor in\n1946\n. However, happy as he was in the United States, once the war had ended and his country was again free, Salem longed to return to France. It is worth noting how, despite his multi-national upbringing, he was a Frenchman with a true love of France. For some years he split his time between Paris and Cambridge, Massachusetts, spending one semester in each. In\n1950\nhe was appointed Professor at MIT and also Professor at the University of Caen in France. He continued to split his time between the two countries until\n1958\nwhen he was appointed as Professor at the Sorbonne. He lived in Paris from that time on until his death.\nAfter Salem died his wife established an international prize for outstanding contributions to Fourier series\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nThe list of those who have received the prize, first awarded in\n1968\n, is impressive and testifies to the explosive activity in this area of mathematics.\nAs to Salem's personality we quote from\n[\n3\n]\n:-\n[\nSalem's\n]\nintellectual brilliance ... attracted people, the more so that it was accompanied by personal charm and natural friendliness. He had a great sense of humour, a vivid way of speaking and was always interested in conversation. But he also had a warm personality and was sensitive to human hardships ... he extended\n[\nhospitality\n]\neasily and it was gladly accepted by his many friends ...\nFinally we should mention his interests outside mathematics. He loved music and played the violin, preferring to play in quartets. He was also interested in the arts, particularly French and Italian literature, while his sporting interests were skiing and horse riding.",
