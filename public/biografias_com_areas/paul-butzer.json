  "biografia": "Paul Butzer\n's parents, Anton Paul Butzer and Wihelmine Hansen, met while students at RWTH\n(\nRheinisch WestfÃ¤lische Technische Hochschule\n)\nin Aachen. Anton, originally from DÃ¼sseldorf, was studying mechanical engineering while Wihelmine, a native of Aachen, was the first woman to study mathematics at RWTH. Anton and Wihelmine Butzer married in\n1925\nand moved to MÃ¼lheim an der Ruhr where Anton worked as an engineer. Soon after Paul was born, the political situation in Germany began to worry the family, as Butzer describes in his autobiographical article\n[\n5\n]\n:-\nMy father was increasingly concerned, as early as\n1929\n, about the wave of Nazism sweeping Germany that he believed would lead to another world war. In\n1936\n, my mother engaged an educated man who had spent a year in a concentration camp, to work in our garden. That same year I caused a fuss at my elementary school when the Nazi flag was ceremonially hoisted for a parade, and I ran home shouting that I did not want to take part in such nonsense. \"Our sons will never join the Hitler-Jugend\n(\nthe Hitler Youth organization\n)\n\", our father always told our mother. \"How can you avoid it - since it is compulsory at age ten?\" our mother replied.\nIn fact Anton Butzer took drastic steps to avoid his family becoming swept up in the Nazi wave. His opposition to the Nazis was already leading to increasingly serious repercussions by spring\n1937\nwhen he left Germany to attend an engineering exhibition in Arnhem, in the Netherlands. He had purchased a return train ticket but had no intention of returning. Once in Arnhem he contacted Ludwig Loewy, a friend who had emigrated to England three years earlier. Loewy sent money to Anton in Arnhem who was then able to travel to England. He joined Loewy's engineering firm in London but, fearing that Paul and his younger brother Karl\n(\nabout\n30\nmonths old at that time\n)\nwould suffer for their father's actions, they had been sent to Gemmenich, a town in Belgium just across the border from Aachen. There they lived at a convent attached to a girl's boarding school while Wihelmine managed to join her husband in London. Once their parents were settled, Paul and Karl were able to join them and, by the autumn of\n1937\n, Paul was studying at the Jesuit Wimbledon College. However, frequent moves followed, and he next attended\n[\n5\n]\n:-\n... the Benedictine Priory at Ealing, and the Collegiate in Bournemouth, a city to which Loewy Engineering moved when London became unsafe during the Nazi bombing raids. It was my fifth school in three countries, each with a different system, within just\n5\nyears.\nAfter a six week internment on the Isle of Man in\n1940\n, along with his mother and brother, Butzer was able to continue schooling until the family were sent to New York where Loewy's engineering firm were opening a new branch. They sailed in January\n1941\nbut after reaching Saint John's, New Brunswick, as German nationals, they were not allowed to enter the United States. Butzer's father got a position with a company in Montreal and in February\n1941\nhe entered Loyola High School. After graduating, he entered Loyola College\n(\nnow Concordia University\n)\nin\n1944\n. After a year he decided to major in mathematics and was awarded a B.Sc. with Honours in\n1948\n. He then entered the University of Toronto where he took courses for a Master's degree. Among his lecturers we mention\nDonald Coxeter\n, who gave courses on non-Euclidean geometry and number theory, and\nBill Tutte\nwho gave a topology course. Butzer received an M.A. in\n1949\n, being awarded the Sir Joseph Flavelle Prize the best performance. He then continued studying at Toronto for his doctorate, supervised by\nGeorge Lorentz\n. As this time\nLorentz\nwas writing his book\nBerstein polynomials\nso work in this area was a natural choice as a topic for Butzer.\nIn\n1951\nButzer was awarded a Ph.D. for his thesis\nOn Bernstein Polynomials\nin which he studied classical Bernstein polynomials and their variant for integrable functions, namely\nKantorovich\npolynomials. In particular he studied their convergence in a number of different spaces. In\n1952\nhe was appointed as a lecturer at McGill University in Montreal and promoted to assistant professor in the following year. In\n1954\nthe International Congress of Mathematicians was held in Amsterdam from\n2\nSeptember to\n9\nSeptember. This European experience made him keen to spend research leave in Europe and he spent the year\n1955\n-\n56\nfirst spending a short time in Paris then spending most of the year in Mainz. He spent a second year\n1956\n-\n57\nat Mainz as a visiting professor. At this stage he decided to resign his position at McGill University and spent a semester at Freiburg University with\nWilhelm SÃ¼ss\n. Of course he was not qualified for a proper position at a German university so, while at Freiburg, he submitted material for his\nhabilitation\n. After teaching for the summer semester of\n1958\nat WÃ¼rzburg University, he began teaching at RWTH in Aachen.\nIn\n1962\nhe was offered a chair at Groningen, in the Netherlands, but this prompted RWTH to also offer Butzer a chair. He accepted Aachen's offer, heading Lehrstuhl A fÃ¼r Mathematik and building a strong school of mathematics there. He explains in\n[\n5\n]\nhow he organised a remarkably successful series of conferences:-\nConvinced of the importance of international and collaborative scholarship, I organized a first international symposium at the Oberwolfach Conference Centre in August\n1963\n. It was, perhaps unexpectedly, successful and was followed by seven further conferences across\n20\nyears. In all, these Oberwolfach symposia - with BÃ©la Szokefalvi-Nagy as co-organizer from the fourth onwards - drew about\n250\ndifferent experts from\n24\ncountries including Hungary, Bulgaria, Poland, Romania and eventually Russia, the roster of participants almost representing a Who's Who in approximation theory and associated fields such as harmonic analysis,\nfunctional analysis\nand operator theory, integral transform theory, orthogonal polynomials, interpolation, special functions, divergent series. The scope of the contacts so facilitated served to weaken national controls over research, favouring the emergence of new clusters of specialists, with partially overlapping interests, all thriving with the heightened interchange of ideas, methods and goals.\nIn\n[\n10\n]\nHiggins gives a summary of Butzer's research contributions:-\nBy\n1971\nPaul's school of approximation theory was well established in Aachen, and in that year the very well-known book 'Fourier Analysis and Approximation', written jointly by Paul and former student R J Nessel, appeared. This ground-breaking project was the first book to emphasize the connections between\nFourier\nanalysis and approximation theory. Work in approximation theory continued, with topics such as best trigonometric approximation\n(\nextending the\nJackson\n-\nBernstein\ntheory\n)\n, and best approximation by algebraic polynomials, an area where some of Paul's finest results are to be found. Paul's interest in probability theory led him in another direction, beginning in about\n1975\n, to study the central limit theorem and the rates associated with its basic convergence theorem. This problem was, of course, well-suited to Paul's expertise in approximation theory and\nFourier\nanalysis. Let us turn to Paul's involvement with signal theory, which began in about\n1970\nwhen he became interested in dyadic analysis, particularly the problem of defining a satisfactory derivative in that setting. A few years later, Paul's interests in the sampling theory of band-limited, and of not-necessarily band-limited, functions were awakened by a group of engineers at Aachen; applications of the theory have never been far from his thinking in this area. Sampling theory now became a major activity at the Lehrstuhl A and prompted a wide ranging programme of research involving colleagues, students and their doctoral dissertations, and conferences large and small.\nLet us look briefly at the books that Butzer has published, with the help of some of his students. First there is the monograph\n(\nwith Hubert Berens\n)\nSemi-groups of operators and approximation\n(1967)\n.\nRichard Askey\nexplains that the book\n[\n1\n]\n:-\n... emphasizes the various semi-groups which pervade approximation theory. The most prominent is the group of translations, but others are integral transforms associated with the names of\nAbel\n,\nPoisson\n,\nGauss\nand\nWeierstrass\n. This book contained the first treatment in book form of the impressive work done on intermediate spaces from the late\n1950\n's on, which was inspired by the classical interpolation\n(\nor convexity\n)\ntheorems of\nM Riesz\n-Thorin-Stein and\nMarcinkiewicz\n.\nD Pascali writes in a review:-\nThis book gives a systematic presentation of the theory of semi-groups of bounded linear operators in a\nBanach\nspace and of their applications in theoretical questions of approximation. The material in it is based on the contributions of the authors and of their co-workers. ... This book assembles in one place the material from a large number of papers and is of interest to workers in different branches of mathematics. The effect of this monograph will be that semi-group theory, hitherto considered only as a chapter of functional analysis, will become a principal tool of mathematical analysis. Moreover, it has already become indispensable in classical approximation theory, in the study of the initial and boundary behaviour of solutions of partial differential equations and in the theory of singular integrals, because of the new results obtained by the authors in these areas. The systematic treatment and the clarity of the proofs make it possible for this work to be used as a textbook for graduate students.\nFollowing rapidly in quick succession there is\n(\nwith Walter Trebels\n)\nHilberttransformation, gebrochene Integration und Differentiation\nâ\n(\nHilbert transforms, fractional integration and differentiation\n)\n(1968)\n, and\n(\nwith Karl Scherer\n)\nApproximationsprozesse und Intepolationsmethoden\nâ\n(\nApproximation processes and interpolation\n)\n(1968)\n. Two years later Butzer published\n(\nwith Rolf J Nessel\n)\nFourier analysis and approximation. Volume\n1\n: One-dimensional theory\n(1970)\n. The authors write in the Preface:-\nApproximately half of this volume deals with the theories of\nFourier\nseries and of\nFourier\nintegrals from a transform point of view. This parallel treatment easily lends itself to an understanding of abstract harmonic analysis; the underlying classical theory is therefore presented in a form that is directed towards the case of arbitrary locally compact abelian groups. The second half is concerned with the concepts making up the fundamental operation of\nFourier\nanalysis, namely convolution. Thus, the leitmotiv of the approximation-theoretic part is the theory of convolution integrals, the 'smoothing' of functions by such, and the study of the corresponding degree of approximation. Special as this approach may seem, it not only embraces many of the topics of the classical theory but also leads to significant new results, e.g., on summation processes of\nFourier series\n, conjugate functions, fractional integration and differentiation, limiting behaviour of solutions of partial differential equations, and saturation theory.\nRichard Askey\nwrites\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nThe style is very leisurely, too much so at times for my taste, but I would have undoubtedly appreciated it when a student. The notes and remarks are not only interesting, they are quite helpful. A list of symbols is given. This should be given in all books, but authors often do not consider the reader's problems and so omit the extra work required to include this list. Butzer and Nessel and the publishers have been very concerned to ease the problems of the student and are to be commended.\nFinally we mention\n(\nwith W OberdÃ¶rster\n)\nDarstellungssÃ¤tze fÃ¼r beschrÃ¤nkte lineare Funktionale im Zusammenhang mit Hausdorff-, Stieltjes- und Hamburger-Momentenproblemen\nâ\n(\nRepresentation theorems for bounded linear functionals associated with Hausdorff, Stieltjes and Hamburger moment problems\n)\n(1975)\n:-\nThe theme of this monograph is the relation between certain \"moment'' problems and various forms of the Riesz representation theorem.\nWe must, particularly in a History of Mathematics Archive, note Butzer's interest in the history of mathematics\n[\n5\n]\n:-\nA topic of one master's thesis of\n1968\nwas the mathematical work and lives of the local mathematicians Dirichlet, Prym, and Hamel. Together with R J Nessel and E L Stark we carried out research projects on the life and work of\nEduard Helly\n, with FranÃ§ois Jongmans on that of\nEugÃ¨ne Catalan\nand\nPafnuty Chebyshev\n, and with Manfred Jansen and Hubert Zilles on the genealogy and work of\nLejeune Dirichlet\n.\nIn\n1981\nButzer edited, in collaboration with F FehÃ©r,\nE B Christoffel: The Influence of His Work on Mathematics and the Physical Sciences\n. As well as editing the book, Butzer contributed an excellent article on the life and work of\nChristoffel\n. The book received outstanding reviews; for example James Rovnyak\n[\n14\n]\nwrites:-\nWritten by experts from diverse fields, the book aims to communicate both historical perspectives and modern ideas across disciplinary boundaries. Careful editing has preserved coherence in the exposition. The book is of a rare genre, and it is highly successful.\nSimilarly, in\n1993\nButzer edited, in collaboration with Dietrich Lohrmann,\nScience in Western and Eastern Civilization in Carolingian Times\n. As well as commenting that the book is \"well-edited\", H L L Busard writes\n[\n4\n]\n:-\nPaul L Butzer presents a broad but un-specialized survey of scholarship in mathematics and astronomy during Carolingian times, in the explicit context of the older sources available to early medieval writers and in comparison with parallel developments in the Byzantine and Islamic worlds.\nFinally we note that Butzer has received many honours for his outstanding contributions. He has been elected to the SociÃ©tÃ© Royale des Sciences de LiÃ¨ge, the\nAcadÃ©mie Royale de Belgique\nand honorary membership of the\nMathematische Gesellschaft\nin Hamburg. He has been awarded honorary degrees from the University of LiÃ¨ge, the University of York in England, and TimiÈoara University. The conference 'Approximation Theory and Signal Analysis', organised by the Institute of Biomathematics and Biometry at the Helmholtz Center Munich, was held in his honour on the occasion of his\n80\nth\nbirthday in\n2009\nat the Hotel Bayerischer Hof, Lindau\n(\nLake Constance\n)\n, Germany.",
