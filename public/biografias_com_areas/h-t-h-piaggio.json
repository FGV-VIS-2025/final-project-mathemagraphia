  "biografia": "H T H Piaggio\n's father was Francis Piaggio\n(\nborn at Hoton, London about\n1839)\nwho was a school teacher of dancing. His mother was Mary Piaggio\n(\nborn at St Pancras, London about\n1855)\nwho was a cloakroom attendant. H T H Piaggio  had a younger sister Edith Mabel\n(\nborn about\n1888)\nwho became a shorthand typist. He also had a younger brother Edward Ernest\n(\nborn about\n1894)\nwho became a clerk.\nH T H Piaggio was educated at the City of London School and at St John's College, Cambridge. In\n1908\nhe was appointed Lecturer in Mathematics at the University of Nottingham although at that time there was no separate Department of Mathematics there. A chair of mathematics was created at Nottingham and Piaggio was appointed to it in\n1919\n. His most famous work,\nAn Elementary Treatise on Differential Equations\n, was published by G Bell & Sons in\n1920\n.\nFull details of his life appear in the obituary by D A Young. We give a version at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nHere list a few articles which Piaggio published in\nThe Mathematical Gazette: Relativity rhymes with a mathematical commentary\n(\nJanuary\n1922)\n;\nGeometry and relativity\n(\nJuly\n1922)\n;\nMathematics for evening technical students\n(\nJuly\n1924)\n;\nMathematical physics in university and school\n(\nOctober\n1924)\n;\nProbability and its applications\n(\nJuly\n1931)\n;\nThree Sadleirian professors: A R Forsyth, E W Hobson and G H Hardy\n(\nOctober\n1931)\n;\nMathematics and psychology\n(\nFebruary\n1933)\n;\nLagrange's equation\n(\nMay\n1935)\n;\nFallacies concerning averages\n(\nDecember\n1937)\n; and\nThe incompleteness of \"complete\" primitives of differential equations\n(\nFebruary\n1939)\n. In\nNature\nPiaggio published articles such as\nThe operational calculus\n(1943)\nand\nThe significance and development of Hamilton's quaternions\n(1943)\n. In the\nProceedings\nof the Glasgow Mathematical Association he published\nExceptional integrals of a not completely integrable total differential equation\n(1953)\n. J M Thomas writes in a review:-\nThe usual theory of a single Pfaffian equation holds if the coefficients are of class C'. The author effectively remarks that this is not a necessary condition for the existence of a solution.\nPiaggio was a member of the\nEdinburgh Mathematical Society\n, joining the Society in May\n1912\n. He read papers to the Society such as\nNote on Linear Differential Equations with constant coefficients\non\n10\nMay\n1912\n.",
