  "biografia": "James Paton\nwas born in Cowdenbeath, Fife, but spent his early years in Kelty\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nWith parents who were fond of music, and with four lively younger brothers, his early days in the family home at Ackergill, Kelty, were happy ones. He was within walking distance of Blairadam, Ben Arty and Loch Leven, and he soon developed a great love of unspoiled nature. Throughout his life he enjoyed camping in Glen Feshie, walking and climbing in the Scottish mountains, and above all the cultivation of his beautiful garden at Abernethy in Perthshire.\nHe completed his secondary education at Beath Secondary School, Cowdenbeath, Fife in\n1921\n, and matriculated at the University of Edinburgh in the same year. His original intention was to study forestry but his interests moved to mathematics and physics and he graduated M.A. with honours in Mathematics and Natural Philosophy in\n1925\n. He then continued studying for a B.Sc. which he completed with honours in physics. He accepted a post at the Meteorological Office in London in\n1927\nbut returned to Edinburgh in the following year when appointed to a Lectureship in Natural Philosophy. He remained on the staff at Edinburgh University throughout his career, being a Lecturer from\n1928\nto\n1950\n, a Senior Lecturer from\n1950\nto\n1954\n, a reader from\n1954\nto\n1964\n, and finally Head of Department of Meteorology from\n1964\nuntil his death in\n1973\n.\nOn\n4\nJanuary\n1950\nthe 'Aims of Science Teaching Conference' was held at King's Buildings Edinburgh with Paton as one of the delegates. The report of the Conference refers to Paton's talk:-\nDealing with \"The Optical Properties of the Atmosphere,\" Mr James Paton said that while mirages were caused by abnormal gradients of temperature in clear air in the lower atmosphere, most of the striking day optical phenomena like rainbows, halves and coronal were produced by reflection and refraction in water droplets or ice crystals. Examination of the spectra of aurora and the night sky yielded valuable information concerning the composition and temperature of the high atmosphere.\nPaton joined the\nEdinburgh Mathematical Society\nin March\n1929\n. He was elected to the\nRoyal Society of Edinburgh\non\n4\nMarch\n1946\n, his proposers being Charles T R Wilson,\nWilliam M H Greaves\n,\nSir Edmund T Whittaker\n,\nGeorge A Carse\n.\nAn obituary, written by M A S Ross, appears in the\nRoyal Society of Edinburgh\nYear Book\n1974\n, pages\n15\n-\n18\n.\nWe give a version of this obituary at\nTHIS LINK\n.",
