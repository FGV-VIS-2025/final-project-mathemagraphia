  "biografia": "Theodore Combridge\nwas the son of Daniel Thomas Combridge\n(1828\n-\n1915)\nand Rhoda Rebecca Gardner\n(1856\n-\n1938)\n. The first surprise from these dates is that Daniel Combridge was\n69\nyears old when his son was born, so we need a few details to put this into context. Daniel Thomas Combridge was baptised on\n16\nMarch\n1828\nin Mayfield, Sussex, England. He became a butcher, as his father had been, and married Miriam Funnell\n(1830\n-\n1860)\non\n11\nJuly\n1854\nat Saint Thomas, Lewes, Sussex. They had two children but Miriam died in\n1860\nand Daniel married his second wife Sarah Paddison\n(1830\n-\n1895)\nin\n1862\nat Cuckfield, Sussex. They had two children but Sarah died in\n1895\nand Daniel married his third wife Rhoda Rebecca Gardner\n(1857\n-\n1938)\nin Brighton in\n1896\n. Daniel and Rhoda Combridge had one child, John Theodore Combridge, the subject of this biography, born at\n5\nLeopold Road, Brighton.\nAt the time of the\n1901\ncensus, the family are living at\n5\nLeopold Road, Brighton. Theodore, who is three years old and listed as John T Combridge, is there with his father and mother, and\n34\n-year old Samuel Combridge, a bookseller and stationer, who is one of Daniel Combridge's sons from his second marriage. The family has three servants, a cook and two housemaids. By the time of the\n1911\ncensus the family consists of John, who is at school, and his parents. They have two servants, a cook and a housemaid.\nIn\n1912\nCombridge entered Brighton College. This school, founded in\n1845\n, was the first independent school in Sussex and had an innovative approach to education being well ahead of its time with the introduction of small group learning and science laboratories. Combridge graduated from the school when World War I was taking place and, although he was admitted to St John's College, Cambridge, before beginning his studies he served in France as a lieutenant in the Royal Field Artillery. On\n21\nFebruary\n1917\n, he became a\n2\nnd Lieutenant in the Special Reserve of Officers. He continued his military duties but soon after the war ended in November\n1918\n, he was able to continue his education at university. He began his studies at St John's College, Cambridge, in\n1919\nwhere he studied the mathematical tripos. He was awarded a College Prize in June\n1921\nand elected to a Foundation Scholarship in that year. He graduated B.A. in\n1921\nbeing a\nWrangler\n(\nequivalent to first class honours\n)\nin the mathematical tripos.\nCombridge continued his studies at King's College London in\n1922\nwhere his studies were supervised by\nGeorge Barker Jeffery\n. Combridge worked on the theory of relativity and was awarded the degree of Master of Science in\n1924\n. He published two papers in\n1923\n, namely\nThe gravitational field of a particle on Einstein's theory\n, and\nAn Einstein Paradox\n. In\n1925\nhe published\nOn the advance of perihelion of mercury\nwhich contains the following abstract:-\nAttention is called to the infinite possibilities of obtaining the Einstein equation for the orbit of a planet by using Newtonian mechanics with an extended potential function. The merits of the other two \"crucial phenomena\" as such are discussed from this point of view. It is implied that, observational tests being equally satisfied,\nEinstein\n's theory is to be preferred on account of its extensive unity and the spontaneity of its results.\nIn\n1926\nhe published\nThe field of a thick spherical shell on Einstein's theory of relativity\n.\nLet us return to giving details of Combridge's career. After the award of his M.Sc., he was appointed as a demonstrator at the City and Guilds College in London. The\nEagle\n, the Magazine for Members of St John's College, Cambridge, reported\n[\n6\n]\n:-\nMr J Combridge\n(\nB.A.\n1921)\nhas been appointed Demonstrator in Mathematics at the City and Guilds\n(\nEngineering\n)\nCollege, South Kensington.\nIn\n1926\nhe was appointed to King's College, London. The\nEagle\nreported\n[\n6\n]\n:-\nMr J T Combridge\n(\nB.A.\n1921)\nhas been appointed an assistant lecturer in mathematics at King's College, London.\nNow he had published research papers when working at the City and Guilds College but once appointed to King's College, London, his research publications stopped. David Robinson explains in\n[\n10\n]\n:-\nJohn Combridge\n(1897\n-\n1986)\n, whom Jeffery had supervised at King's for a MSc degree, was appointed as an assistant lecturer in\n1926\n. Before the mid thirties only the senior members of the mathematics department had much time for research and junior members like Combridge carried a heavy teaching load. After completing his MSc, and while he was at The Royal College of Science, he published three papers on relativity but after coming to King's little more. However Combridge remained interested in the subject and corresponded extensively with\nEddington\n, an association begun when Combridge was an undergraduate at Cambridge.\nOn\n30\nDecember\n1926\n, Combridge married Norah Elizabeth Charlwood\n(1894\n-\n1966)\n, the daughter of the dairyman Ernest Percy Charlwood\n(1868\n-\n1946)\nand Maud Mary Cridland\n(1866\n-\n1939)\n. The\nEagle\nreported\n[\n6\n]\n:-\nJohn Theodore Combridge\n(\nB.A.\n1921)\n, lecturer in mathematics at King's College, London, to Norah Elizabeth Charlwood, of Redhill - on December\n30\nth,\n1926\n, at Galeed Chapel, Brighton.\nNorah had been a student at the University of London and had been awarded a B.A. with distinction in\n1918\n. Theodore and Norah Combridge had three children.\nAfter his appointment to King's College, London, his career progressed in two different paths. One of these was a move towards mathematical education, becoming an important figure in the\nMathematical Association\n, and the other path was into university administration. His activity in the\nMathematical Association\nis described in\n[\n7\n]\n:-\nA member of the\nMathematical Association\nsince\n1930\n, he was Chairman of the Teaching Committee from\n1950\nto\n1956\n, President\n1961\n-\n62\n, and for some years afterwards Chairman of the Standing Committee of Council. But also he was instrumental in the formation of the Joint Mathematical Council, and from\n1964\nuntil a professional team was appointed he undertook a major part of the administration of the\nInstitute of Mathematics and its Applications\n. To cite only a few other activities, there was the work of the Schools and Industry Committee of the Association, forward-looking and seminal, and led so effectively by J T Combridge. A splendid conspectus 'Count me in' edited by him, grasped the problems of numeracy, or the lack of it, and a history of the\nMathematical Association\nowes much to his spade.\nFor his description of the early history of the\nMathematical Association\n, see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nFor his Presidential Address to the\nMathematical Association\n, see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nDuring his time as President of the\nMathematical Association\n, Combridge was much involved in the setting up of the\nInstitute of Mathematics and its Applications\n. He wrote an article on the\nOrigins of the Institute of Mathematics and its Applications\nwhich you can read at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nAlan Broadbent\nreviews\nCount me in. Numeracy in Education\nin\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nIn his introductory survey, Mr Combridge displays that happy knack of his, so familiar to members of the Association, of picking out the right nails and hitting them hard; his team drives the points home. Here we have ten authoritative essays which take the theme from the primary school to the Sixth form, to the problems of teacher training and adult education, and out into the fields of commerce and industry. I admire the insight and wisdom of the contributors, which, if space allowed, could be exemplified by quotation of penetrating and informative remarks from every page of the book. The case for numeracy, the ends envisaged, the means whereby those ends may be attained, all these are described in good, simple English by people who know what they are talking about; if occasionally an axe is ground, sincere enthusiasm rather than fanaticism is responsible. Mr Combridge would like the book to be read by four classes of people: parents who want to know what this \"new mathematics\" is doing for their children; teachers, particularly those who may be called upon to teach mathematics on a somewhat slender qualification; managers in commerce and industry who have a vague feeling that modern mathematics may have something to offer them; the ordinary citizen who, as Sir John Newsom says in his foreword, has to live \"in a world whose situations and problems cannot even be described\n(\nnot to say understood and tackled\n)\nwithout both numeracy and literacy\". In other words, it is a book for all of us.\nDuring his involvement with the\nMathematical Association\n, Combridge wrote a number of papers of teaching mathematics. These included:\nDifferentials\n(1934)\n,\nThe Solution of Triangles Given Three Sides\n(1936)\nand\nThe \"ambiguous case\" in the solution of triangles\n(1937)\n. He was also involved in the\nMathematical Association\n's reports on trigonometry\n(1950)\n, calculus\n(1951)\n, higher geometry\n(1953)\n,and the teaching of mechanics\n(1965)\n.\nHis role in university administration began in\n1937\nwhen he accepted the position of assistant secretary at King's College, London\n[\n9\n]\n:-\nHe played a leading part in managing the college's wartime precautions, including the evacuation to Bristol\n(1939\n-\n43)\n. In\n1947\nhe was appointed registrar - a new position - alongside a new secretary. This division of labour, and his administrative skill, helped him also to pursue with vigour and growing influence his wider interests in the post-war development of mathematics education.\nExactly why Combridge moved into administration is unclear. He had corresponded with\nArthur Eddington\nsince his undergraduate days at Cambridge and Eddington wanted to communicate his results to the\nRoyal Astronomical Society\non using general relativity to determine the effect of the sun's rotation on the orbits of the planets. Combridge never wrote this paper because of his move into administration.\nClive Kilmister\nspeculates why Combridge moved into administration\n[\n8\n]\n:-\nIt is certain that he felt confident that he would succeed Shovelton as Secretary, a post which the divided constitution of the King's of the time made particularly important, since the Principal had no jurisdiction over the Theological Faculty and the Dean none outside it, leaving the Secretary as the critical link. Financial considerations were perhaps not wholly absent but much more important was undoubtedly his loyalty to the college and the feeling that he could do the job well. And he entertained hopes 'of being able to keep up my mathematical reading'. No sooner had he begun, with characteristic thoroughness, to learn his new job than he had to prepare plans for the college departments to be evacuated to Bristol and Birmingham in the event of war, and then to implement these plans. ... In the event Combridge was disappointed\n(\ntwice\n)\nover the Secretary's post but this was never allowed to affect for a moment his loyalty to the college or his energetic service.\nThere is a publication by Combridge which we have not mentioned yet, but clearly deserves a place particularly in an archive on the history of mathematics\n[\n8\n]\n:-\nCombridge determined from the beginning to pursue a scholarly course of action and read deeply in the literature of general relativity. This reading had two outcomes. Firstly, there are three bound volumes, entitled 'Notes on Relativity' which he presented to the college archives. They contain his very careful notes, abstracts and reviews, usually about two quarto pages, of one hundred published papers on relativity and supporting parts of pure mathematics. Ninety of these constitute an extensive survey of the important literature with papers each year from\n1921\nto\n1936\n, with a peak in numbers between\n1930\nand\n1933\n. Secondly, he compiled a more extensive bibliography of some\n1\n,\n700\ntitles of papers in general relativity over the same period in the form of a card index, with pithy comments.\nIn fact this card index was published by King's College, London, in\n1965\nas\nBibliography of relativity and gravitation theory\n1921\nto\n1937\n.\nCombridge retired from his position at King's College in\n1962\nand his wife Norah died on\n28\nDecember\n1966\n. At this time the family were living at\n36\nLemsford Road, St Albans. Combridge married Winifred Adelaide Cooke\n(1905\n-\n1986)\non\n22\nApril\n1972\nat Eton, Buckinghamshire. He had met Winifred, the daughter of the upholsterer Ernest Alfred Cooke and Lucy Adeland, through the\nMathematical Association\n. They had announced their engagement at the\n1972\nAnnual General Meeting of the\nMathematical Association\nin Edinburgh. Winifred graduated with a B.Sc. from the University of Birmingham in\n1926\nand was awarded a Diploma in Education in\n1928\n[\n7\n]\n:-\n... a teacher of great distinction,\n[\nshe\n]\nhad joined the Association in\n1934\n. From\n1952\nto\n1962\nshe was Honorary Secretary and only those most closely involved with the administration of the\nMathematical Association\ncould realise how much time, effort and expertise she gave to that post. Later, however, her zeal and energy had another outlet when she served as Secretary of the Centenary Appeal.\nBoth Combridge and his wife were elected honorary members of the\nMathematical Association\n, Theodore at the\n1967\nAGM, Winifred at the\n1971\nAGM. The year\n1986\nsaw Winifred's and Theodore's deaths, hers on\n23\nOctober and his on\n10\nDecember. He died at\n18\nAlexandra Road, Watford, and was buried on\n17\nDecember at St Peter's Church, St Albans. Michael Price writes\n[\n9\n]\n:-\nCombridge was widely respected both at King's College and in the\nMathematical Association\n, not only for his administrative skill but also for his unswerving loyalty, integrity, inspiring leadership, and sympathetic support for all sectors of the teaching profession. His very sharp but kind sense of humour helped to enliven many committee meetings and social gatherings.",
