  "biografia": "Eduard Helly\ncame from a Jewish family in Vienna. He studied at the University of Vienna and was awarded his doctorate in\n1907\nafter writing a thesis under the direction of\nWirtinger\nand\nMertens\n. His thesis was on\nFredholm\nequations.\nWirtinger\narranged a scholarship for Helly so that he could continue his studies at GÃ¶ttingen and he went there after graduating from Vienna.\nAt GÃ¶ttingen Helly studied under\nHilbert\n,\nKlein\n,\nMinkowski\nand\nRunge\nin\n1907\n-\n8\n. Returning to Vienna in\n1908\nhe had no university post, but supported himself in a number of different ways. He taught in a\nGymnasium\n, gave private tuition, and wrote solution manuals for a series of standard textbooks. During this period, he undertook research on\nfunctional analysis\nand proved the\nHahn\n-\nBanach\ntheorem in\n1912\n, fifteen years before\nHahn\npublished essentially the same proof and\n20\nyears before\nBanach\ngave his new setting. We discuss this more fully later in this article.\nOn the outbreak of World War I, Helly enlisted in the army. While serving as a lieutenant in September\n1915\nhe was shot. The bullet went through his lung and did damage to his health from which he never recovered throughout the rest of his life. After being shot he was captured by the Russians. After this he spent years in hospitals and prisoner of war camps in Siberia. One might have expected that the end of World War\n1\nin\n1918\nwould have led to Helly's release but by this time the Russian armies were fighting each other and escape was impossible. Even after leaving Russia it was a long route back to Vienna for Helly who travelled through Japan, the Far East, Egypt and the Middle East before reaching home in\n1920\n.\nHelly was married in\n1921\nto Elise Bloch who also had a doctorate in mathematics from Vienna. In the same year he submitted his\nhabilitation\nthesis and received the right to teach. He was appointed to Vienna in\n1921\nbut to an unpaid post. His wife believed that he was denied a professorship\n[\n4\n]\n:-\n... partly because Helly was Jewish and also because\nHahn\nthought a younger person should be preferred.\nHelly was forced to earn a living working in a bank, then as an actuary when the bank collapsed in\n1929\n. He then found a job with an insurance company but even this difficult life became worse in\n1938\n. Hitler himself had entered Austria on\n12\nMarch\n1938\nwith the German army, and a Nazi government had been set up there. Helly was dismissed from his post because he was a Jew. He fled from Austria to save himself and his family, emigrating to the United States in\n1938\n.\nLife remained difficult for Helly and his family in the United States. At first he resorted to giving private tuition as he had done in Vienna many years before. His first break occurred in\n1939\nwhen\nEinstein\nsupported him for a position in Paterson Junior College in New Jersey. With support from so eminent a person as\nEinstein\n, he was successful and received the position. Two years later, in\n1941\n, he moved to Monmouth Junior College, also in New Jersey. The following year saw both Helly and his wife employed as mathematicians by the Signal Corps in Chicago. Helly again took up familiar work since he was preparing mathematics training manuals, while his wife taught mathematics.\nIt was during his time with the Signal Corps in Chicago that he suffered his first heart attack. This was still as a direct result of the damage which he had suffered when shot during World War I. He recovered from the heart attack and things began to look up when he was offered a chair of mathematics as Illinois Institute of Technology. Sadly he died after a second heart attack shortly after.\nHe is remembered for Helly's theorem, published in\n1923\n, which states that if there are given\nn\nn\nn\nconvex subsets of a\nd\nd\nd\n-dimensional Euclidean space with\nn\nâ¥\nd\n+\n1\nn â¥ d+1\nn\nâ¥\nd\n+\n1\nand if each collection of\nd\n+\n1\nd + 1\nd\n+\n1\nof the subsets has a point in common then there is a common point of the\nn\nn\nn\nsubsets.\nHowever, as we noted above, in a paper he published in\n1912\nthere are a number of important results. First there is Helly's selection principle which says that given a sequence of functions of bounded variation which are of uniform bounded variation and uniformly bounded at a point, then there exists a subsequence which converges to a function of bounded variation.\nThere are other results in the paper which should have given Helly a much higher profile in the world of mathematics than he has achieved. One is the fact that he gives the\nHahn\n-\nBanach\ntheorem for the space\nC\n[\na\n,\nb\n]\nC[a, b]\nC\n[\na\n,\nb\n]\n, while he is providing a simpler proof of a theorem which\nRiesz\nhad published the previous year. He also gives the uniform boundedness principle for linear functionals, the\nBanach\n-\nSteinhaus\ntheorem. As the authors of\n[\n4\n]\nwrite:-\nHad Helly succeeded in staying in the mainstream of mathematics, as an academician who published and participated in seminars, he would have undoubtedly have capitalised on his earlier contributions. He not only might have seen to it that proper credit should be ascribed, but it is likely that he would have extended his results further. ... In most careers there are some disappointments and failures, but Helly's career derailed early, and life never gave him a chance to get back on the right track.",
