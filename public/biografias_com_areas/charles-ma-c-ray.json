  "biografia": "Charles MÃ©ray\nstudied at the Ãcole Normale SupÃ©rieure in Paris. He began his studies in\n1854\nwhen he was eighteen years old, and graduated in\n1857\n. After graduating, MÃ©ray taught at the LycÃ©e of St Quentin for two years but then left teaching for seven years during which time he lived in a small village near Chalon-sur-SaÃ´ne.\nFollowing these seven years when he chose not to work, MÃ©ray took up a teaching position again in\n1866\n, this time lecturing at the University of Lyon for a year before being appointed as Professor of Mathematics at the University of Dijon. He would continue to work in Dijon for the rest of his career.\nRobinson\nwrites in\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nIn his time he was a respected but not a leading mathematician. MÃ©ray is remembered for having anticipated, clearly and with only minor differences of style,\nCantor\n's theory of\nirrational\nnumbers, one of the main steps in the arithmetisation of analysis.\nSo here we have a case of a mathematician who produced work which might have made him one of the leading mathematicians in the world. However, as happened many times throughout history, MÃ©ray was unlucky for the genius of his work was not recognised at the time. Others\n(\nwe give details below\n)\npublished the same ideas and it would be their work rather than that of MÃ©ray which influenced the direction of mathematics. All we can do now is to give MÃ©ray the credit he deserves for his remarkable work, even if fate did not allow MÃ©ray a role of importance in the development of the subject.\nIn\n1869\nMÃ©ray was the first to publish an arithmetical theory of irrational numbers in his paper\nRemarques sur la nature des quantitÃ©s dÃ©finies par la condition de servir de limites Ã  des variables donnÃ©es\nâ\n(\nNotes on the nature of variables defined by the condition that they serve as limits of given variables\n)\n. Others such as\nMartin Ohm\n(1829)\n,\nBolzano\n(1835)\nand\nHamilton\n(1833)\nhad published work on irrational numbers but none of these earlier authors gave a rigorous account. MÃ©ray's is the earliest coherent and rigorous theory of the irrational numbers to appear in print. His work was not influenced by\nWeierstrass\n(\nwhose work was unpublished\n)\nor\nDedekind\nwho only published his theories after\nCantor\n's important paper appeared in\n1872\n. MÃ©ray followed\nLagrange\n's earlier work but gave rigorous proofs of what\nLagrange\nhad only conjectured.\nMÃ©ray published a second important work in\n1872\n. This work is a book\nNouveau prÃ©cis d'analyse infinitÃ©simale\nâ\n(\nNew summary of mathematical analysis\n)\nwhich aims to present the theory of functions of a complex variable using power series. It is another rigorous work and in fact between\n1872\nand\n1894\nMÃ©ray produced a series of papers which remove geometric considerations from analytic proofs. MÃ©ray's work consistently follows\nLagrange\nin basing the whole of analysis on the concept of functions written as\nTaylor series\n.\nWe have noted above that MÃ©ray's work had no real influence on the development of mathematics despite being almost exactly the same as the work which would transform the direction of mathematics. It was not that MÃ©ray's work went unnoticed. His\n1872\nbook\nNouveau prÃ©cis d'analyse infinitÃ©simale\nwas reviewed by\nHermann Laurent\nin\n1873\n.\nHermann Laurent\n, in his review, ignored MÃ©ray's irrational numbers\n[\n1\n]\n:-\n... while gently chiding the author for using too narrow a notion of a function and for being too rigorous in a supposed textbook. At that time there was not in France - as there was in Germany - a sufficient appreciation of the kind of problem considered by MÃ©ray, and not until much later was it realised that he had produced a theory of a kind that had added lustre to the names of some of the greatest mathematicians of the period.",
