  "biografia": "Albert Wangerin\n's parents were Heinrich Wangerin, who was a master plumber, and Emilie Bathke. The family were members of the Evangelical Lutheran Church. Albert attended the\ngymnasium\nat Greiffenberg from\n1853\nto\n1862\n, obtaining the grade \"excellent\" in his final examinations in\n1862\n.\nHe entered the University of Halle in the spring of\n1862\nand there he studied mathematics and physics. At Halle he was taught mathematics by\nEduard Heine\n, August Rosenberger and\nCarl Neumann\n, and physics by H Knobloch. From Halle Wangerin moved to the University of KÃ¶nigsberg in\n1864\nwhere he undertook research under\nFranz Neumann\n's supervision. He was awarded his doctorate on\n16\nMarch\n1866\nfor his thesis\nDe annulis Newtonianis\nâ\n(\nOn the works of Newton\n)\n. It is clear, both from Wangerin's subsequent career, and from his writings, that he was greatly influenced by\nNeumann\n. Wangerin went on to undertake research for the rest of his life on topics suggested by\nNeumann\n. Also Wangerin\n[\n1\n]\n:-\n... later wrote a book\n(1907)\nand a highly appreciative article on his former teacher.\nIn fact the book was entitled\nFranz Neumann und sein Wirken als Forscher und Lehrer\nâ\n(\nFranz Neumann and his work as a researcher and teacher\n)\nwhile Wangerin actually published three articles on his former teacher, one in\nJahresberichte der Deutschen Mathematiker vereinigung\n(1894\n-\n95)\n, one in\nLeopoldina\n(1896)\n, and the article\nFranz Neumann als Mathematiker\nin\nZeitschrift fÃ¼r Physik\n(1910)\n.\nAlthough\nJacobi\nhad died over ten years before Wangerin began his studies at KÃ¶nigsberg, his influence was still strongly felt and it would not be unreasonable to say that Wangerin, through his teachers at KÃ¶nigsberg, was strongly influenced by\nJacobi\n's style of mathematics. After he was awarded his doctorate, he took the examinations to become a school teacher and trained at the Friedrichswerdersche Gymnasium in Berlin during the year\n1866\n-\n67\n. He then taught for a year at another Berlin school, later named the Andreasrealgymnasium. He was appointed as a teacher of mathematics in a Gymnasium in Posen on\n1\nOctober\n1868\n. Wangerin moved from Posen back to Berlin where again he taught mathematics in a Gymnasium from\n1\nApril\n1869\nuntil\n31\nMarch\n1876\n.\nIn addition to his teaching activities, Wangerin also took on the role of coeditor of the yearbook\nJahrbuchs Ã¼ber die Fortschritte der Mathematik\nâ\n(\nYearbook on the progress of mathematics\n)\nin\n1869\n. He held this editorial role up to\n1878\n, but he also had an advisory role which he continued until\n1924\n. Wangerin married Johanna Thorn on\n14\nApril\n1871\n; they had five children, three sons and two daughters. Their first son Ernst\n(\nborn\n6\nMay\n1872)\nwent on to obtain a doctorate in history, a second son Albert\n(\nborn\n19\nJune\n1873)\nwent on to obtain a doctorate in chemistry, a daughter Ella\n(\nborn\n21\nSeptember\n1874)\nbecame a piano teacher, a daughter Kaethe\n(\nborn\n5\nAugust\n1878)\nbecame a draftswoman, and a son Walter\n(\nborn\n15\nApril\n1884)\nbecame a professor of plant ecology at the Technische Hochschule in Danzig.\nIn the spring of\n1876\nWangerin was appointed as an extraordinary professor at the University of Berlin. His appointment was specifically to teach first year undergraduates, for neither\nKronecker\nnor\nWeierstrass\nlectured at this level. Wangerin remained in Berlin until\n1882\nwhen he was offered the position of ordinary professor at the University of Halle-Wittenberg. The chair had fallen vacant when\nHeine\ndied in October\n1881\n, and Wangerin was appointed to succeed his former teacher.\nBack in the university in which he had studied as an undergraduate, Wangerin held his professorship there until he retired in\n1919\n. His most prestigious position he held during this period was rector of the university for the academic year\n1910\n-\n11\n. He continued to live in Halle after his retirement and was active in mathematical research almost until his death at the age almost\n89\n.\nWangerin's research was on\npotential theory\n, spherical functions and\ndifferential geometry\n. A major work was\nReduction der Potentialgleichung fÃ¼r gewisse RotationskÃ¶rper auf eine gewÃ¶hnliche Differentialgleichung\nâ\n(\nReduction of the potential equation for certain rotating bodies to an ordinary differential equation\n)\npublished in\n1875\n. He wrote an important two volume treatise on potential theory and spherical functions\nTheorie des Potentials und der Kugelfunktionen\nâ\n(\nTheory of  potential and spherical harmonics\n)\n(1909\n,\n1921)\n. Despite great expertise in applications to mathematical physics, research was not the most important of Wangerin's contributions to the development of mathematics. Wangerin's main contribution was his writing of textbooks, writing for encyclopaedias and his historical writings. As examples of Wangerin's historical writing, in addition to the articles on his teacher\nFranz Neumann\nwhich we mentioned above, we should point in particular to the article he wrote on\nEduard Heine\nin\n1928\nas well as to his input to editing the works of\nGauss\n,\nEuler\n,\nLambert\n, and\nLagrange\n. His two major encyclopaedia articles were both written for\nEncyklopÃ¤die der mathematischen Wissenschaften\nâ\n(\nEncyclopedia of Mathematical Sciences\n)\n,  the first in\n1904\nbeing\nTheorie der Kugelfunktionen und der verwandten Funktionen, insbesondere der LamÃ©schen und Besselschen\n(\nTheorie spezieller, durch lineare Differentialgleichungen definierter Funktionen\n)\nâ\n(\nTheory of spherical functions and related functions, in particular the LamÃ© and Bessel functions\n(\ntheory of special functions, defined by linear differential equations\n)\n)\non functions such as the\nLamÃ©\nand\nBessel\nfunctions, while his second written in\n1909\nwas\nOptik Ã¤ltere Theorie\nan erticle on optics for the physics volume of the encyclopaedia.\nHe also played a major role in the reviewing of mathematical papers. We mentioned above that he was coeditor of\nFortschritte der Mathematik\nfrom\n1869\nto\n1921\nand in this role he had a major influence in the policy of the only reviewing journal for mathematics that there was at the time. His influence as a teacher was also strongly felt\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nWhile at Berlin he directed his lectures to a fairly broad audience, and even at Halle he continued to be greatly interested in the training of high school teachers.\nHe taught many courses at the University of Halle including: linear partial differential equations; calculus of variations; theory of elliptical functions; synthetic geometry; hydrostatics and capillarity theory; theory of space curves and surfaces; analytic mechanics; potential theory and spherical harmonics; celestial mechanics; the theory of the map projections; hydrodynamics; and the partial differential equations of mathematical physics.\nWangerin was honoured with election to the\nGerman Academy of Scientists Leopoldina\nin\n1883\n. He served as President of the Academy from\n1906\nuntil he resigned in\n1921\n. He received an honorary degree from the University of Upsala in Sweden in\n1907\n, and several medals, including the Cothenius medal from the\nGerman Academy of Scientists Leopoldina\nin\n1922\n.",
