  "biografia": "Jules BienaymÃ©\n's first name of IrenÃ©e is usually written IrÃ©nÃ©e but the form without an accent was used by the subject of this biography and thereafter became a family tradition. However, he did not use the name, always using the name Jules. We note that his father used the spelling BienaimÃ© as did Jules until\n1812\nwhen he changed the spelling to BienaymÃ©. His parents, Jean Charles BienaimÃ© and Houdar de la Motte Pierre Marie, were married in the church of St Roch in Paris on\n3\nJuly\n1795\n. They had two children; IrenÃ©e Jules\n(\nthe subject of this biography\n)\nwas born at the rue de la Loi\n(\nnow called rue de Richelieu\n)\nand his brother Charles Philippe AimÃ© was born on\n4\nFebruary\n1800\n. The city of Bruges had become French in\n1794\nand French officials were sent there to administer the city. Jean Charles BienaimÃ© became the chef des bureaux du secrÃ©tariat in\n1803\n. In this capacity he got to know Napoleon Bonaparte who lodged in Bruges in\n1804\nand again in\n1810\n. Jules attended the LycÃ©e impÃ©rial at Bruges and the city had happy memories for him. He wrote\n(\nin a letter to\nQuetelet\nwritten on\n25\nJune\n1861)\n[\n4\n]\n:-\nI can't forget Bruges, and regret not being able to go there again. Perhaps it would not be particularly cheerful in my old age to revisit the places of my happy childhood.\nIn\n1811\nthe BienaimÃ© family returned to Paris where Jules attended the LycÃ©e Louis-le-Grand. Both brothers changed the spelling of their name to BienaymÃ© early in\n1812\n. After taking part in the defence of Paris in\n1814\n, Jules BienaymÃ© entered the Ãcole Polytechnique in the following year. This was not an easy time in Paris, as France lost its Empire and the monarchy was restored, and the Ãcole Polytechnique was closed in\n1816\ninterrupting his studies. Also in\n1816\nJean Charles BienaimÃ© died and, as Jules became responsible for the family, he took a job at the Ministry of Finances. In\n1819\nBienaymÃ©, wanting to make a career in science rather than administration, became a lecturer in mathematics at the military academy of St Cyr. However, he only held the post from\n1\nNovember\n1819\nto\n10\nFebruary\n1820\nwhen he returned to his Civil Service job in the Administration of Finances. It is not clear why he left his teaching post although we do know that the director of the academy wrote that he had \"not having found conditions compatible with his tastes and habits\". There do seem to be more reasons why he left and one seems related to\nSimÃ©on Denis Poisson\n, who had chosen him for the post, for from that time on BienaymÃ© became openly hostile to him. In the Ministry of Finances he was soon promoted to inspector, then in\n1834\nhe became inspector general.\nIn the late\n1820\ns, rather remarkably, the BienaymÃ© brothers married two sisters. Jules married Frangoise Gabrielle Clemence Harmand and his brother Charles Philippe AimÃ© married Jeanne Justine Lucie Harmand. Their wives were daughters of the Philippe Nicolas Harmand who was a family friend and had signed Jules' birth certificate. They had long known each other for the BienaymÃ© and Harmand families had shared the same house in Paris for a while. Jules and his wife had two sons and three daughters, The children, in order of birth, were: Lilia Nathalie FranÃ§oise Laure, Lucie Gabrielle LÃ©onie\n(\nborn\n4\nSeptember\n1831)\n, Arthur FranÃ§ois Alphonse\n(\nborn\n13\nJanuary\n1834)\n, Louis IrenÃ©e Alexis\n(\nborn\n8\nApril\n1836)\n, and Adrienne Clementine Laure\n(\nborn\n19\nJune\n1840)\n. Despite not being in the academic world, BienaymÃ© produced mathematical work of remarkable ingenuity but\n[\n14\n]\n:-\n... characterised, to the frustration of the reader, by lack of mathematical proofs for assertions sometimes far ahead of their time, ...\nHe explained in a letter written to\nAdolphe Quetelet\non\n21\nApril\n1846\n[\n14\n]\n:-\n... that his everyday work and the state of his health do not permit him to complete the preparation of his writings for publication, and that he works seriously on applications which are of interest to both of them. His ill-health, especially his trembling hands, were to plague him to the end of his life.\nAfter the revolution of\n1848\nBienaymÃ© was forced to retire from the Ministry of Finances for political reasons as the new regime installed their own people in top posts. Shortly after he left the Civil Service he was asked to give a lecture course on\nprobability\nat the Faculty of Sciences. In August\n1850\nhe was reinstated into the Ministry of Finances as Inspecteur gÃ©nÃ©ral des finances but he resigned for a final time in April\n1852\n. Eugene Seneta writes in\n[\n14\n]\nthat BienaymÃ©'s:-\n... last home\n(\nin\n1866)\nwas at rue de Fleurus, No\n1\n, just before the western entrance of Jardin du Luxembourg and a short walk from the great church of St Sulpice, at which a commemorative service was held a year after his death. He died on\n19\nOctober\n1878\nand is buried at the CimitiÃ¨re de Montparnasse, Paris, in a modest family grave at Division\n10\n, Ligne\n4\nSud, NumÃ©ro\n12\nouest.\nIn\n1852\nBienaymÃ© was elected to the Paris\nAcademy of Sciences\nand for the next\n23\nyears he was the referee for the statistics prize. He was also a founding member of the\nSociÃ©tÃ© MathÃ©matique de France\nbecoming president of the Society in\n1875\n. He was elected to the SociÃ©tÃ© Philomatique de Paris in January\n1838\nand, from\n1837\nto\n1845\n, much of his published material appears as reports of his addresses to meetings of the Society, reported in its journal\nL'Institut\n.\nIn fact BienaymÃ© only published\n23\narticles during his life and half of these were published in obscure places such as the\nL'Institut\n. The early articles discuss demography and life tables. He also wrote on the size of juries and the majority need for a conviction. In fact the jury system in France at that time was based on\nLaplace\n's conclusions but it was under attack by\nPoisson\n. BienaymÃ© supported\nLaplace\non this issue. In fact BienaymÃ© supported\nLaplace\nin general since it was\nLaplace\n's\nThÃ©orie analytique des probabilitÃ©s\nâ\n(\nAnalytic theory of probabilities\n)\n(1812)\nthat was the biggest influence on BienaymÃ©'s scientific thinking throughout his life. One of his many contributions was to generalise the\nLaplace\nmethod of least squares - in fact much of his work can be thought of as extending and generalising ideas introduced by\nLaplace\n.\nAn excellent linguist, BienaymÃ© translated\nPafnuty Chebyshev\n's work from Russian into French. In fact BienaymÃ© was a friend of\nChebyshev\n(\nthey first met in October\n1852)\n, and also of other important mathematicians such as\nAdolphe Quetelet\n,\nAntoine Cournot\nand\nGabriel LamÃ©\n. In fact\nQuetelet\nand BienaymÃ© were born in the same year and corresponded regularly between\n1846\n(\nthe year in which they first met\n)\nand\n1871\n. On the other side, there were a number of mathematicians who BienaymÃ© seems particularly keen to criticise, such as\nAugustin-Louis Cauchy\n,\nSimÃ©on Poisson\nand\nJoseph Bertrand\n. He argued with\nCauchy\nover the least squares method and, in\n1842\n, he criticised\nPoisson\n's law of large numbers. BienaymÃ© was quite wrong in his criticism of\nPoisson\nbut in general he was years ahead of his time in the depth of his statistical ideas.\nBienaymÃ© published the BienaymÃ©-\nChebyshev\ninequality, which was used to give a very simple and precise demonstration of the generalised law of large numbers, in his important paper\nConsidÃ©rations Ã  l'appui de la dÃ©couverte de Laplace sur la loi de probabilitÃ© dans la mÃ©thode des moindres carrÃ©s\nâ\n(\nConsiderations to support the discovery of Laplace on the probability distribution in the least squares method\n)\n(1853)\n.\nChebyshev\npublished the inequality in a Russian paper and its French translation which both appeared in\n1867\n. The French paper was published in\nLiouville\n's\nJournal de MathÃ©matiques Pures et AppliquÃ©es\nand the editor clearly realised that the inequality had been given by BienaymÃ© fourteen years earlier since he reprinted BienaymÃ©'s\n1853\npaper immediately before\nChebyshev\n's paper\n[\n14\n]\n:-\nIt is a pity that their common interest in the Inequality somehow \"slipped through the cracks\" in the early contacts between BienaymÃ© and\nChebyshev\n. Possibly the Inequality was regarded by BienaymÃ© as a minor result compared with his main themes of linear least squares and Laplacian defence.\nChebyshev\n's recognition of its significance and its clear statement has, at any rate, always been a defensive point in his favour stressed by some historiographers.\nBienaymÃ© also worked on independent binomial trials and his most important contribution was his statement of the criticality theorem for simple branching processes which he gave in\n1845\n- eventual extinction of a family name has probability one if and only if the mean number of male children is one or less. His work on this predates that by\nGalton\nand Haldane.\nDavid Kendall\nwrites in\n[\n12\n]\n(\nreviewing C C Heyde and E Seneta's book\n[\n1\n]\n)\n:-\nSome years ago the present authors\n[\nHeyde and Seneta\n]\nmade the startling discovery that the criticality theorem for branching processes, previously assigned to the year\n1873\n, was in fact known in\n1845\n, and indeed that earlier version due to BienaymÃ© is complete and correct, unlike the\nGalton\n-Watson version which contains an error that was not cleared up for many years. This discovery necessitated the re-writing of the history of branching processes ...\nHe also gave a simple test for randomness of observations on a continuously varying quantity. He stated, and gave a proof which leaves something to be desired, of a sophisticated limit theorem which was studied again by\nvon Mises\nin\n1919\n. Eugene Seneta writes in\n[\n14\n]\n:-\nIt is also clear\n[\nthat BienaymÃ©\n]\nunderstood the idea of covariance of random variables in\n1842\n, and had a notion of conditional expectation.\nEugene Seneta also tries to explain why BienaymÃ©'s brilliance has been forgotten\n[\n14\n]\n:-\nContributing to his being largely forgotten were the facts that BienaymÃ© was modest as regards his own achievements, made no great efforts to assert his priority, and was ahead of his time in mathematical statistics. He left no disciples, not being in academia; and wrote no book.",
