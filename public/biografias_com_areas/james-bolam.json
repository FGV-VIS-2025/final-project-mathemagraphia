  "biografia": "James Bolam\n's father was Thomas Bolam\n(\nborn about\n1804\nin Elsdon, Northumberland\n)\nwho was a coachman, and his mother was Jane Bolam\n(\nborn about\n1797\nalso in Elsdon\n)\n. He had several siblings: Elizabeth\n(\nborn about\n1830)\n, William\n(\nborn about\n1835)\nand Mary Jane\n(\nborn about\n1835)\n. In\n1851\n, when James was\n12\nyears old, he was living at Haywards Yard, Cloth Market, Newcastle upon Tyne, Northumberland.\nBolam was educated in Newcastle, the city of his birth. His first post was at the Trinity Navigation School of Newcastle and from there he went to Leith, the port for the city of Edinburgh, where he taught at the Government Navigation School.\nWhen James Bolam become a founder member of the\nEdinburgh Mathematical Society\nin\n1883\nhe was head of the Government Navigation School in Leith:-\n... a significant group of trained navigation teachers having their own bond of common origin were planted in the nautical community and, although many became private teachers, the hopes for a broader educational base to navigation teaching were not forgotten. James Bolam served as head at Leith for\n63\nyears until\n1924\n, building up his school to such an extent that it was designated a Central Institution in\n1903\n.\nThe Government Navigation School became Leith Nautical College in\n1903\nand Bolam remained as head until he retired in\n1924\n. He was then made an honorary member of the\nEdinburgh Mathematical Society\nand, on retirement from the College, moved to St Helen's, Drumchapel, Dumbartonshire where he lived with his son.\nFor more information see Bolam's\nScotsman\nObituary at\nTHIS LINK\n.",
