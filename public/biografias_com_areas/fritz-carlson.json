  "biografia": "Fritz David Carlson\nwas born in Vimmerby, where his father, John Vilhelm Carlson, was a house and land holder; his mother was Lovisa Mathilda Carlson. He studied at secondary schools in Vimmerby\n(1899\n-\n1903)\nand in Linkping\n(1903\n-\n1907)\nsitting his final high school graduation examination on\n4\nJune\n1907\n. He matriculated as a student at Uppsala University on\n5\nSeptember\n1907\n. He was awarded his Master of Science degree on\n30\nMay\n1911\n, Licentiate on\n14\nDecember\n1912\n, and defended his Ph.D. thesis\nOn a class of Taylor series\non\n26\nMay\n1914\n(\nundertaken with the supervision of Anders Wiman\n)\n, and became Doctor of Philosophy on\n30\nMay\n1914\n.\nAs a Liljewalch scholar he visited the University of Gttingen during the period January to August\n1916\n, the University of Berlin and the Technical University in Berlin-Charlottenburg from September to December\n1916\n, and as a Thunsk scholar he also visited Paris in\n1920\n.\nHe was an acting teacher at the State School in Vimmerby\n(1910\n-\n11)\n, then auxiliary actuary at the Fire and Life Insurance Company Svea\n(2\nJune -\n8\nSeptember\n1911)\n. On\n3\nJune\n1914\nhe became a\ndocent\nin mathematics at Uppsala University\n(\ndocent in the Swedish system means the same as\nhabilitation\nin other countries\n)\n. During the period from\n1914\nto\n1915\nhe was a deputy at the Teacher Studies in Uppsala, partly as professor of mathematics at Uppsala University\n(7\nMay -\n27\nMay\n1920)\nand then, from\n9\nJuly\n1920\n, he was appointed as professor of descriptive geometry at the Royal Institute of Technology\n(\nKTH\n)\nin Stockholm, a post which he held until\n1927\n.\nOn\n8\nAugust\n1923\nhe married a dentist Marie Louise Ljungberger\n(\nborn on\n24\nJune\n1894)\n, a daughter of Johan August Pettersen.\nStarting in\n1923\nhe worked for several years as a censor at the student examination. This now historic activity started in\n1862\nwhen the universities ceased to have entrance examinations and ended in\n1968\n. The replacement was a flying inspection in which teams of university professors went to the gymnasiums as auditors of the oral examinations and censors when the grades were decided.\nFrostman\n[\n10\n]\nhas written about the atmosphere of his work as a censor\n(\nsee\nalso\n[\n8\n]\n, p.\n213)\n:-\nIn this task he found ample use not only of his experience of pure mathematics but also of his vast knowledge of literature, history, geography and French literature. Many high school teachers, whose teaching he supervised, keep the memory of a demanding censor with a certain stern sense of humour but also men of superior comprehension and unfailing judgement.\nFrom\n1927\nhe became a professor of higher mathematical analysis at the Stockholm University College. Carlson was a real professor in the Swedish tradition of that time. We can quote here\nGarding\nwho has written in\n1997\non page\n212\nof\n[\n8\n]\n:-\nCarlson was one of those who with refined methods continued\nMittag-Leffler\n's effort in the theory of analytic functions. In his daily life he personified the correct professor ...\nand also Kjellberg in\n1995\non page\n92\nof\n[\n13\n]\n:-\nHe was a perfectionist and he could be strict in social intercourse. I think he liked me because I wrote about somewhat old-fashioned things within function theory. In any case he showed me great kindness. Carlson held a very careful oral examination after a student had been awarded a pass in a written examination. It could happen that he started with a candidate in the morning, sent him for lunch, continued for a couple of hours, and then failed him.\nHe was a member of the\nRoyal Swedish Academy of Sciences\nfrom\n1927\n, the Society of Sciences in Uppsala from\n1928\n, the Royal Physiographic Society of Lund from\n1940\n, and one of the editors of\nActa Mathematica\nfrom\n1930\n. After\nCarleman\n's death in\n1949\nhe administrated the\nMittag-Leffler\n's Institute.\nCarlson had only three Ph.D. students: H RadstrÃ¶m\n(1952)\n, T Ganelius\n(1953)\nand\nG Dahlquist\n(1958)\n.\nCarlson died on\n28\nNovember\n1952\nin Stockholm.\nHis main work focused on the theory of analytic functions. Some of his most well-known contributions are a theorem connected to the Phragmn-Lindelf principle, a theorem about the zeros of the\nV\nV\nV\n-function and several theorems about power series with integer coefficients. Such names as\nCarlson inequality, Carlson - Levin constants, Carlson theorem in complex analysis,\nPÃ³lya\n-Carlson theorem on rational functions and Carlson theorem on\nDirichlet\nseries\nare well-known in mathematics\n(\nsee\n[\n5\n]\n,\n[\n15\n]\nand\n[\n14\n]\n)\n.\nCarlson's inequality,\nproved in\n1934\n, states that:\n(\nâ\nn\n=\n1\nâ\nâ£\na\nn\nâ£\n)\n4\nâ¤\nÏ\n2\nâ\nn\n=\n1\nâ\nâ£\na\nn\nâ£\n2\nâ\nn\n=\n1\nâ\nn\n2\nâ£\na\nn\nâ£\n2\n(\\sum ^{â}_{n=1} |a_{n}|)^{4} â¤  \\pi^{2} \\sum ^{â}_{n=1} |a_{n}|^{2} \\sum ^{â}_{n=1} n^{2}|a_{n}|^{2}\n(\nâ\nn\n=\n1\nâ\nâ\nâ£\na\nn\nâ\nâ£\n)\n4\nâ¤\nÏ\n2\nâ\nn\n=\n1\nâ\nâ\nâ£\na\nn\nâ\nâ£\n2\nâ\nn\n=\n1\nâ\nâ\nn\n2\nâ£\na\nn\nâ\nâ£\n2\nand its integral version that\n(\nâ«\n1\nâ\nf\n(\nx\n)\nd\nx\n)\n4\nâ¤\nÏ\n2\nâ«\n1\nâ\nf\n2\n(\nx\n)\nd\nx\nâ«\n1\nâ\nx\n2\nf\n2\n(\nx\n)\nd\nx\n(\\int ^{â}_{1} f(x) dx)^{4} â¤  \\pi^{2} \\int ^{â}_{1} f^{2}(x) dx  \\int ^{â}_{1} x^{2}f^{2}(x) dx\n(\nâ«\n1\nâ\nâ\nf\n(\nx\n)\nd\nx\n)\n4\nâ¤\nÏ\n2\nâ«\n1\nâ\nâ\nf\n2\n(\nx\n)\nd\nx\nâ«\n1\nâ\nâ\nx\n2\nf\n2\n(\nx\n)\nd\nx\nwith the best possible constant\nÏ\n2\n\\pi^{2}\nÏ\n2\n. Carlson himself obviously believed that his inequality was independent of other inequalities e.g. that of\nHÃ¶lder\n. Therefore it must have been a big surprise for him when\nHardy\ntwo years later showed that the inequality even follows from the\nSchwarz\ninequality. Different proofs, further generalisations together with some historical remarks and applications in interpolation theory and functional analysis are discussed in\n[\n5\n]\n,\n[\n15\n]\nand\n[\n14\n]\n.\nCarlson's theorem\nin complex analysis, says that if\nf\n(\nz\n)\nf(z)\nf\n(\nz\n)\nis an analytic function satisfying\nâ£\nf\n(\nz\n)\nâ£\nâ¤\nC\ne\nk\nâ£\nz\nâ£\n|f(z)| â¤ Ce^{k|z|}\nâ£\nf\n(\nz\n)\nâ£\nâ¤\nC\ne\nk\nâ£\nz\nâ£\n, where\nk\n<\nÏ\nk < \\pi\nk\n<\nÏ\nfor\nR\ne\n(\nz\n)\nâ¥\n0\nRe(z) â¥ 0\nR\ne\n(\nz\n)\nâ¥\n0\n, and if\nf\n(\nz\n)\n=\n0\nf(z) = 0\nf\n(\nz\n)\n=\n0\nfor\nz\n=\n0\n,\n1\n,\n2\n,\n.\n.\n.\nz= 0, 1, 2, ...\nz\n=\n0\n,\n1\n,\n2\n,\n.\n.\n.\n, then\nf\n(\nz\n)\nf(z)\nf\n(\nz\n)\nis identically zero\n(\ncf.\n[\n6\n]\n)\n.\nCarlson, in a series of papers, investigated\nDirichlet\nseries and proved in\n1922\nthat if\nf\n(\nz\n)\n=\nâ\nn\n=\n1\nâ\na\nn\nn\nâ\nz\nf(z) = \\sum ^{â}_{n=1} a_{n}n^{-z}\nf\n(\nz\n)\n=\nâ\nn\n=\n1\nâ\nâ\na\nn\nâ\nn\nâ\nz\nis convergent in\nR\ne\n(\nz\n)\nâ¥\n0\nRe(z) â¥ 0\nR\ne\n(\nz\n)\nâ¥\n0\nand bounded in every\nR\ne\n(\nz\n)\n>\nÎ´\n>\n0\nRe(z) > \\delta  > 0\nR\ne\n(\nz\n)\n>\nÎ´\n>\n0\n, then, for each\nÏ\n>\n0\n\\sigma > 0\nÏ\n>\n0\n,\nâ\nn\n=\n1\nâ\nâ£\na\nn\nâ£\n2\nn\nâ\n2\nÏ\n=\nl\ni\nm\nT\nâ\nâ\n1\n2\nT\nâ«\nâ\nT\nT\nâ£\nf\n(\nÏ\n+\ni\nt\n)\nâ£\n2\nd\nt\n.\n\\sum ^{â}_{n=1}|a_{n}|^{2}n^{-2\\sigma} = lim_{T\\rightarrow â} \\large\\frac{1}{2T}\\normalsize  \\int _{-T}^{T}|f( \\sigma+it)|^{2}dt.\nâ\nn\n=\n1\nâ\nâ\nâ£\na\nn\nâ\nâ£\n2\nn\nâ\n2\nÏ\n=\nl\ni\nm\nT\nâ\nâ\nâ\n2\nT\n1\nâ\nâ«\nâ\nT\nT\nâ\nâ£\nf\n(\nÏ\n+\ni\nt\n)\nâ£\n2\nd\nt\n.\nCarlson wrote a solid\nTextbook of geometry\nin two volumes\n(\nGleerup, Lund,\n1943\n,\n1947)\n. This resulted from his teaching at KTH, covering first year geometry at the university. He also published a book\nGeometry of space\n(\nUppsala,\n1949)\n.\nAt a mature age Carlson could remark that\n(\nsee\n[\n8\n]\n, p.\n212)\n:-\n... every mathematician ought to do some work with the\nRiemann\nÎ¶\n\\zeta\nÎ¶\n-function.\nCarlson published over thirty papers in mathematics.\nYou can see a list of these papers at\nTHIS LINK\n.",
