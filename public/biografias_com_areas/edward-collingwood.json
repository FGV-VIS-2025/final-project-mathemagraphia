  "biografia": "Edward Collingwood\n's parents were Dorothy Fawcett and Colonel Cuthbert George Collingwood. Colonel Collingwood had a career in the army, commanding the Lancashire Fusiliers in the battle of Omdurman in September\n1898\n. In this battle the Anglo-Egyptian force commanded by Kitchener defeated the Mahdists and established British dominance in Sudan. Colonel Collingwood retired from the army in\n1899\n, the year before his son Edward was born on the family estate of Lilburn Tower. The estate is in Northumberland in the north of England about\n7\nkm from Wooler on the road to Alnwick\n(\nwhich is about\n20\nkm to the south east\n)\n. Edward was the oldest of his parents four children, all boys, and he was brought up on the family estate enjoying\n[\n2\n]\n:-\n... shooting and fishing and the social life of the country.\nWe should note that Edward's mother Dorothy came from a well off family, and the name \"Foyle\" is the name of their family estate. Dorothy\n[\n2\n]\n:-\n... was always a strong influence on the family.\nCollingwood was educated at the Royal Naval College Osborne, which he entered in\n1913\n, moving to Dartmouth in the following year. He joined the Navy and became a midshipman in\n1915\non the ship HMS Collingwood. This ship was named after Vice-Admiral Cuthbert Collingwood who was Nelson's second in command at the battle of Trafalgar. Vice-Admiral Collingwood was the brother of Edward Collingwood's great-grandfather, and it was no coincidence that Collingwood served on HMS Collingwood for special arrangements had been made for this to happen.\nHowever Collingwood's naval career came to an end when he fell down a hatchway on board ship, broke his wrist and damaged his knee, just before the Battle of Jutland. He was transferred to the hospital ship, then invalided out of the Navy. Attempting to go to Woolwich he failed the medical examination so, in\n1918\n, he entered Trinity College, Cambridge to study mathematics.\nCollingwood was influenced by his advisor of studies,\nHardy\nat Cambridge and decided early on that he would undertake research in mathematics. He was also influenced by\nLittlewood\n, but his examination performance was relatively poor and he obtained only a Second Class degree in\n1922\n. Although there were many others in Collingwood's year at Cambridge like\nBurkill\n,\nIngham\nand\nNewman\n, he seems to have had little contact with them. A friend, Gilbert Ashton, writing of these days, wrote that Collingwood was:-\n... always known by his friends and contemporaries of Trinity as 'The Admiral' ... I remember The Admiral as a quiet, reserved and rather shy person ...\nCartwright\ndescribes how Collingwood behaved as an undergraduate in\n[\n2\n]\n:-\n... he kept somewhat aloof from his mathematical contemporaries, and had a full, but entirely separate, social life among a group, most of whom had served in the forces ... He used his private means to entertain well, but never ostentatiously.\nIn\n1922\nCollingwood went to Aberystwyth at the invitation of\nW H Young\n. He was awarded the Rayleigh prize from Cambridge in\n1923\nbut failed to obtain a fellowship. It was at this time that he completed his work on generalising\nNevanlinna\n's second fundamental theorem, which became his first paper in\n1924\n. Awarded a\nRouse Ball\ntravelling scholarship, he spent\n1924\n-\n25\nat the Sorbonne. Despite his examination results he returned to Cambridge to study for a Ph.D. with\nLittlewood\nas his supervisor. He received his doctorate for a thesis entitled\nContributions to the theory of integral functions of finite order\nin\n1929\n. From\n1930\nhe was appointed Steward of Trinity and gave advanced courses on integral and\nmeromorphic\nfunctions but gave no undergraduate courses.\nIn\n1937\nCollingwood left Cambridge and became High Sheriff of Northumberland. However when World War II began in\n1939\n, he became a naval scientist. As stated in\n[\n3\n]\n:-\n... he got himself into uniform early in the war and his record is impressive.\nHe was in charge of the Sweeping Division in\n1943\n, then Chief Scientist in the Admiralty Mine Design Department in\n1945\n. For his war work he was awarded the C.B.E. and received the Legion of Merit from the USA in\n1946\n.\nAfter the war he returned to his researches on meromorphic functions, publishing an important paper in\n1949\n. He then undertook research work with\nMary Cartwright\non the theory of cluster sets.\nMary Cartwright\nwrites:-\nI tried to contribute what I could to this paper ... my impression is that it was much less than his contribution. I also collaborated in one later paper published in\n1961\non an allied topic. ... I found myself quite unable to grasp the deep results in the theory of sets of points on which much of Collingwood's later work in this field depended.\nCollingwood became involved with hospital boards in Newcastle, being a founder member of the Newcastle Regional Hospital Board and its chairmen from\n1953\nto\n1968\n, then later he was involved with medical affairs on a national and international level. He was vice-president of the International Hospital Federation from\n1959\nto\n1967\n, a member of the medical research council from\n1960\nto\n1968\n, and he served on the royal commission on medical education from\n1965\nto\n1968\n. He was chairman of the Council of Durham University for most of the\n1950\n's and\n1960\n's.\nHe was elected to a fellowship of the\nRoyal Society\nin\n1965\n. He also served the\nLondon Mathematical Society\nin many ways, as a member of the Council and as Treasurer. He wrote an article in\n1951\nto mark the centenary of the Society. He was knighted in\n1962\n.\nDespite these numerous activities Collingwood still found time for various hobbies. In particular he had a fine collection of eighteenth century paintings, and a collection of Chinese porcelain. As with all his activities Collingwood made a deep study of his hobbies and became a recognised expert on Chinese porcelain.\nHis character is described in\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nCollingwood was loved and admired both for his achievements and for the delight of his company. ... he had great intellectual powers which enabled him to achieve excellence in diverse activities conducted in parallel and not in series. Born in Glendale in Northumberland he remained a countrymen at heart with practical knowledge of forestry, farming and gardening. ... He remained a bachelor to the grief of the many dancing partners who had been entranced by his waltzing!\nHis appearance is described in\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nCollingwood was short and fair and walked with long strides. He early became very bald.",
