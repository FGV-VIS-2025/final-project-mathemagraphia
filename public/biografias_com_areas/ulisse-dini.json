  "biografia": "Ulisse Dini\n's parents were Pietro Dini and Teresa Marchionneschi Dini. It was certainly not a wealthy family but Dini's parents were able to educate him in his native city of Pisa. He attended the Scuola Normale Superiore in Pisa which was a teacher's college, under the leadership of Enrico\nBetti\n, attached to the University of Pisa.\nDini grew up at a time when political, and military, events in Italy were intensifying as the country came nearer to unification. There were not only the internal politics of unification but the was problems with Austria and France, both countries having their own agendas. In\n1859\n, when Dini was thirteen years old, there was a war with Austria in which the French at first joined the Italians against the Austrians. However, by\n17\nMarch\n1861\n, the Kingdom of Italy was formally created. Rome and Venice were not part of Italy at this stage, however, and there continued high levels of political activity as the govenment structure was discussed.\nIn\n1865\nDini entered a competition for a scholarship to provide the necessary funds to allow a student to further their studies abroad. He won the scholarship and went to Paris where he studied with\nBertrand\nand\nHermite\n. This was a period of high mathematical activity for Dini and seven publications came out of the research he undertook during his time in Paris.\nDini returned to Pisa in\n1866\n, and was appointed to a post in the University of Pisa. There he taught advanced topics in algebra and also the theory of geodesy. Political events in Italy continued, with the Treaty of Vienna bringing Venice into the Italian Kingdom in\n1866\n. Rome was attacked by Italian troops the following year but France defended the city with its troops against the attack. There was widespread unrest in Italy due to dissatisfaction with the government and it was far from clear that the newly unified country would not split apart again. In\n1870\n, however, Italian troops captured Rome.\nDini progressed quickly in his career at the University of Pisa, being appointed to\nBetti\n's chair of analysis and higher geometry in\n1871\n. This was not due to Betti's retiral, but rather because Betti's interests had moved more towards mathematical physics. Dini was not someone who was going to concentrate solely on mathematics and a university career, the political events of the time having a profound effect on someone of Dini's character who was\n[\n1\n]\n:-\n... an upright, honest, kind man ... devoted to the well-being of his native city and his country ...\nDespite the workload required in his university career, Dini entered politics in\n1871\n(\nalthough he was only\n25\nyears old at the time\n)\nwhen he was elected to the Pisa City Council. With a period of consolidation for the newly unified Italy, local government became very significant and Dini was keen to do all he could in this important area. His political and academic careers progressed side by side over the following years. In\n1877\nhe was appointed to a second chair in the University of Pisa, from then on holding the chair of infinitesimal analysis in addition to his earlier professorial appointment. Having served many times on the Pisa Council, Dini was elected to the national Italian parliament in\n1880\nas a representative from Pisa.\nNot only was Dini highly involved in teaching mathematics and in local and national politics, but in\n1888\nhe reached the highest office in university administration when he became rector of the University of Pisa. He held this post until\n1890\n, then two years later he was elected a senator in the Italian Parliament. He became director of the Scuola Normale Superiore, the teacher's college at which he was himself educated, in\n1908\nand held this position until his death.\nDini's most important work in mathematics was on the theory of functions of a real variable. The paper\n[\n4\n]\ngives a good survey of the problems which Dini worked on in the\n1860\ns and\n1870\ns, and the most important of the results which he obtained. Bottazzini, the author of\n[\n4\n]\n, puts Dini's work in context showing that it was carried out at a time when those studying real analysis were seeking to determine precisely when the theorems which had earlier been stated and proved in an imprecise way were valid. To achieve this aim mathematicians tried to see how far results could be generalised and they needed to find pathological counterexamples to show the limits to which generalisation was possible. Dini was one of the greatest masters of generalisation and constructing counterexamples.\nDini looked at infinite series and generalised results such as a theorem of\nKummer\nand one of\nRiemann\n, the ideas for which had first emerged in work of\nDirichlet\n. He discovered a condition, now known as the Dini condition, ensuring the convergence of a\nFourier series\nin terms of the convergence of a definite integral. As well as trigonometric series, Dini studied results on\npotential theory\n.\nHe studied surfaces and developed ideas related to those of\nLiouville\nand\nBeltrami\n. He studied\n[\n1\n]\n:-\n... surfaces of which the product or the ratio of two principal radii of curvature remains constant\n(\nhelicoid surfaces to which Dini's name has been given\n)\n;\n[\nand\n]\nruled surfaces for which one of the principal radii of curvature is a function of the other ...\nHe solved a problem posed by\nBeltrami\nof representing one surface on a second surface in such a way that geodesic lines in the first correspond to geodesic lines in the second.\nDini published a number of major texts throughout his career. He published\nFoundations of the theory of functions of a real variable\nin\n1878\n; a treatise on Fourier series in\n1880\n; and a two volume work\nLessons on infinitesimal analysis\nwith the first volume appearing in\n1907\nand the second in\n1915\n. In this last work he devoted a chapter to\nintegral equations\nin which he presented many of his own innovative ideas.\nDini's most famous student was\nBianchi\n.",
