  "biografia": "Abdel-Shafy Obada\n's name is sometimes transliterated as \"Abada\" and it appears in this form in a number of documents. His scientific papers which were written in English, however, all use the form \"Obada\", so we will use that form throughout this biography. He attended the new Assiut University which began teaching in session\n1957\n-\n58\n. There were only\n198\nstudents,\n12\nfaculty members and two assistants when it opened. The university was one year old when Obada began studying there in\n1958\n. He graduated in\n1962\nwas a B.Sc. having been awarded Honours in Mathematics. For the next two years he worked at Assiut University as a Demonstrator in the Faculty of Science before being awarded a scholarship to study for a Ph.D. in England.\nFor his doctoral research, Obada attended the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology\n(\nUMIST\n)\nbeginning his studies in\n1964\n. Let us be strictly accurate and explain that when Obada arrived at UMIST it was in fact named the Manchester College of Technology. It had gained university status in\n1956\nand was undergoing a period of rapid expansion. It was renamed the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology in\n1966\nwhile Obada was studying there. His thesis advisor at UMIST was Robin K Bullough.\nRobin Bullough\n(1929\n-\n2008)\nspecialised in theoretical physics as a student at the University of Cambridge before studying for a Ph.D. in chemistry at the University of Leeds. He had been appointed to UMIST as a lecturer in the Department of Mathematics in\n1960\nand was promoted to reader in\n1967\n, the year that Obada completed his Ph.D. in Mathematics. Obada's thesis was entitled\nMathematical treatment of microscopic optics\n. After completing his thesis, he was appointed as a Special Demonstrator in the Department of Mathematics at UMIST where he worked for a year and continued to undertake active research, collaborating with several people but especially with Robin Bullough. During this year he published five papers:\nMicroscopic Theory of the Einstein optical scattering equations\n(1968)\nwas co-authored with R K Bullough, B V Thompson\n(\nalso from the Department of Mathematics at UMIST\n)\nand F Hynne\n(\nfrom the H C Orsted Institutet in Copenhagen\n)\n; and the four papers\nOptical propagators and properties of the finite molecular crystal\n(1969)\n,\nDielectric constants for the cubic molecular crystal\n(1969)\n,\nThe binding energy of molecular crystals\n(1969)\nand\nLongitudinal modes and optical rotation in the finite molecular crystal\n(1969)\nwhich were all\n2\n-author works by Obada and Bullough.\nFor the Abstracts of these five papers\n(\nand many other papers by Obada\n)\n, see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nIn\n1969\nObada returned to Egypt where he was appointed as a Lecturer in Mathematics in the Faculty of Science of Al-Azhar University in Cairo. This university, which has a long history as a centre of Islamic learning, was founded as a modern university with secular subjects in\n1961\n. It was not long before Obada was back in Manchester, for he spent his first summer vacation, July-August\n1970\n, at the\n1\nst Symposium on Quantum Optics held in Manchester.\nBetween January and April\n1972\n, Obada was at the International Centre for Theoretical Physics at Trieste, Italy. This Centre had been proposed by the physicist Abdus Salam in\n1960\nand, in\n1963\n, the Italian government agreed to host such a Centre in Trieste. It opened in\n1964\nwith Abdus Salam as its first director. Its main aim was to:-\nFoster the growth of advanced studies and research in physical and mathematical sciences, especially in support of excellence in developing countries.\nIn\n1982\nObada became an Associate of the International Centre for Theoretical Physics and continued in this role until\n1995\n, making research visits to the Centre in ten of these fourteen years.\nYou can read Abstracts of ten reports which he co-authored with other scientists at the Centre during these years at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nObada quickly gained an outstanding reputation in Egypt and in the rest of the world, and he was known as the successor to\nAli Mostafa Mosharrafa\n. Let us now look briefly at his career. We noted above that he became a Lecturer in Mathematics at Al-Azhar University in Cairo in\n1969\n. He was promoted to Senior Lecturer in Mathematics at Al-Azhar University in\n1974\nbut left one year later to take up the position of Associate Professor in the Department of Mathematics at King Abdulaziz University in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. This university had been established in\n1967\nand took in its first intake of less than one hundred students in the following year. It was in\n1974\nthat the University became a government establishment and efforts were made to expand it into a large modern university. The Faculty of Science was established in that year consisting of departments of mathematics, physics, chemistry, geology and biology. Obada was appointed to the Department of Mathematics and he worked there for four years.\nObada has produced a remarkable number of publications, almost all working with colleagues many being part of the research school he built, but there was a spell after he left Manchester when he published very little. After the\n1969\npapers which we mentioned above, except for conference contributions he only published one paper in the following eight years, namely\nTheory of radiation reaction and atom self-energies: all-order perturbation theory of the generalized non-relativistic Lamb shift\n(1974)\n, a joint paper with R K Bullough and P J Caudrey. His move to King Abdulaziz University seems to have prompted him to great publishing activity beginning with a\n1977\npaper\nOn the response of a system in a fiel\nd, a single author paper which he published in the first volume of the\nBulletin\nof the Faculty of Science of King Abdulaziz University.\nIn\n1979\nhe returned to Al-Azhar University where he was appointed as Professor of Applied Mathematics. He served as Chairmen of the Department of Mathematics in\n1982\n-\n84\n. He was also the Secretary to the Board of the Faculty of Science from\n1980\nto\n1984\n. His output of scientific papers became remarkable and these made fundamental contributions to radiation theory first introduced by\nHendrik Lorentz\nin\n1909\n. You can see a list of some of these papers, many with abstracts, at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nAs well as these scientific papers, written in English, Obada was also writing textbooks in Arabic. By\n1984\nhe had three such books in print, namely\nIntroduction to Mathematics for Science and Engineering\n,\nMathematics in Economics and Management Part I\n, and\nMathematics in Economics and Management Part II\n. These were all popular and second editions appeared in\n1985\n,\n1984\nand\n1984\nrespectively. We have mentioned\n1984\nseveral times in the above and this is because in that year Obada was appointed as Professor of Mathematics in the Department of Mathematics, Faculty of Education, Umm-Al Qura University, Taif, Saudi Arabia. The College of Education in Mekka had been established in\n1962\nand this joined the College of Education in Taif in other new departments in the founding of Umm-Al Qura University in\n1981\n. Obada spent five years in the Department of Mathematics of Umm-Al Qura University in Taif and was able to supervise the establishment and building up of the Department of Mathematics. In\n1989\nhe returned to Al-Azhar University in Cairo where he was again Chairman of the Department of Mathematics.\nObada played a large role in the founding of the Egyptian Mathematical Society in\n1992\n. He was elected as the first President of the Egyptian Mathematical Society and has continued in that role. Volume\n1\nof the\nJournal\nof the Egyptian Mathematical Society appeared in\n1993\nwith Obada as the Editor-in-Chief. He had continued in this role. As an example of the activities of the Society we note that it ran the International Conference on Mathematics, Trends and Development in December\n2017\n. The conference was held in Dar al-Diyafa, Ain Shams University, Cairo and covered the following topics: Mathematical Physics, Computer Science, Numerical Analysis Methods and Applications, Topology & Geometry and Applications, Algebra and applications, Differential Equation and Applications, Dynamical Systems and Applications, Mathematical Statistics, and Functional Analysis.\nIn\n1994\nObada was awarded a D.Sc. by the University of Manchester.\nAlthough Obada did not visit the International Centre for Theoretical Physics at Trieste after\n1995\n, he did make other visits, for example spending September-October\n1996\nas a Visiting Professor at McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada. In the following year he spent August-September at Antwerp University in Belgium. He also participated in many conferences.\nAmong the many awards and prizes given to Obada, we mention his election as a fellow of the\nEgyptian Academy of Sciences\n(1995)\n, as a fellow of the British Institute of Physics\n(2000)\n, as a fellow of the African Academy of Sciences\n(2001)\n, and as an elected member of the Academy of Arabic Language\n(2013)\n. He was Vice-President of the African Academy of Sciences from\n2004\nto\n2013\n. He received the Egyptian State Prize for Scientific Creativity in Basic Sciences\n(2004)\n, the State Recognition Prize in Basic Sciences\n(2005)\n, the Elsevier prize for scientific publications and citations\n(2008)\n, the Misr El-Kheir Prize for highly cited papers\n(2011)\n, the Nile Award in Science from the Academy of Scientific Research & Technology\n(2012)\n, the State Sciences and Arts Medal of the First Order\n(2014)\nand the African Union's Kwame Nkrumah Laureate of Basic Science, Technology and Innovation Award\n(2019)\n. The citation for this last award states that:-\nProfessor Obada carries out research studies that deal with the interaction of fields with matter. In the seventies and eighties Obada and co-workers produced papers devoted to reaction field theory that played a fundamental role in the radiation theory since it was first introduced by\nLorentz\n(1909)\n. Professor Obada and his group have published significant papers in the fields of quantum optics, quantum information, and quantum computation.\nYou can see the titles and some abstracts of these papers at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nFinally we note that there is an Obada Prize. It is described in\n[\n8\n]\n:-\nObada-Prize is an international award, endowed by the Natural Sciences Publishing. Initiated as a recognition of his excellence Professor Abdel-Shafy Obada. The Obada-Prize recognizes and encourages innovative and interdisciplinary research that cuts across traditional boundaries and paradigms. It aims to foster universal values of excellence, creativity, justice, democracy, and progress and to promote the scientific, technological and humanistic achievements that advance and improve our world.\nThere are three prizes supported by African Academy of Sciences\n(\nNorth Africa Branch\n)\n.\nDistinguished Researcher.\nThe target group is researchers who are aged\n40\nor below.\nUndergraduate and Post Graduate Students\n(\nThe prize will be awarded according to the student's presentation and no need to send a published work\n)\n.",
