  "biografia": "Brian Sleeman\nis the son of Richard Kinsman Sleeman and Gertrude Cecilia Gamble. Richard Sleeman\n(1904\n-\n2002)\nwas born in Launceston, Cornwall on\n6\nOctober. He had two brothers, one of whom was killed in World War I, and two sisters. Gertrude Gamble\n(1904\n-\n1998)\nwas born in Norfolk on\n29\nNovember.\nBrian Sleeman was educated in London and attended the Battersea College of Technology\n(\nnow the University of Surrey\n)\n, being awarded a B.Sc. in\n1963\n. On\n7\nSeptember\n1963\nhe married Juliet Mary Shea; they have three children, Elizabeth Anne Sleeman, Matthew Alexander Sleeman, and David James Sleeman.\nContinuing his studies in London, Sleeman undertook research at the University of London advised by Felix Medland Arscott. Felix Arscott\n(1922\n-\n1996)\nserved in World War II before obtaining a University of London degree through private study. He was awarded a Ph.D. from the University of London in\n1956\nfor his thesis\nEllipsoidal Harmonics and Ellipsoidal Wave Functions\nand, after teaching in Aberdeen, was appointed to Battersea College of Technology. He was an expert in higher special functions. The reference\n[\n3\n]\nis Sleeman's obituary of his advisor Arscott.\nSleeman was awarded a Ph.D. in\n1966\nfor his thesis\nSome Boundary Value Problems Associated with the Heun Equation\n. His first paper was published in\n1966\n, being\nThe expansion of LamÃ© functions into series of associated Legendre functions of the second kind\n. It appeared in the\nProceeding\nof the Cambridge Philosophical Society. He writes in the Introduction:-\nIn this paper, a study is made of the solutions of\nLamÃ©\n's differential equation as series of associated\nLegendre\nfunctions. The particular feature studied is the representation of the second solution corresponding to the case when the first solution is a\nLamÃ©\npolynomial.\nSleeman's address on this paper, when it was submitted on\n11\nOctober\n1965\n, was Department of Mathematics,Â Battersea College of Technology,Â London. A note on the paper gives his present address, presumably at the time of the acceptance of the paper, as Department of Mathematics, Queen's College, Dundee, Scotland. He ends the paper with the following acknowledgement:-\nI am grateful to Prof F M Arscott and my colleague Mr D C Stocks for their valuable help in the preparation of this paper, and also to Mr R S Taylor for permission to use his unpublished results concerning the integral relations for\nLamÃ©\nfunctions of the second kind.\nHis second paper\nThe scalar scattering of a plane wave by an ellipsoid\nwas published in\n1967\nwith his address given as Department of Mathematics, Queen's College, Dundee, Scotland. He gives the following Abstract to this paper:-\nThe problem of scalar\nDirichlet\nscattering by a general ellipsoid is discussed. An exact solution of the wave equation is determinedÂ viaÂ the method of separation of the variables leading to expressions for the total field and the far field amplitude in terms of ellipsoidal wave function products. Particular attention is paid to the case when the ellipsoid is almost a prolate spheroid. Finally methods of numerical solution are discussed and two new results in ellipsoidal wave function theory are obtained.\nWhen Sleeman was appointed as an Assistant Lecturer in Mathematics at Queen's College, Dundee, he became a member of staff of the University of St Andrews since the College was part of the University of St Andrews until\n1967\n. At the time of his appointment,\nHenry Jack\nwas a senior lecturer in Mathematics at Queen's College, Dundee,\nNorrie Everitt\nwas the Baxter Professor of Mathematics in Dundee and head of the Department of Mathematics while\nDouglas Jones\nwas head of the Department of Applied Mathematics and held the\nIvory\nChair of Applied Mathematics. Brian Sleeman writes in\n[\n5\n]\n:-\nOn my arrival\n[\nin Dundee\n]\nI was immediately aware that teaching and scholarship in its widest form were of the highest priority. There was also no pressure on colleagues to write grant proposals but rather to pursue research for its own sake and to make original contributions.\nDouglas Jones\nnever directed the research of young staff but was always there to give encouragement and offer ideas. In my case, after a couple of years, Douglas told me that he thought it would be a good idea if I spent a year at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences at New York University. In particular he arranged for me to work in\nJoe Keller\n's group. So my wife, Julie, and I, together with two very young children, headed off to the 'Big Apple' and spent what for me was a momentous and exciting year, which had a fundamental influence on my career. There I met\nR\n(\nRichard\n)\nCourant\nand enjoyed seminars by\nP D Lax\n,\nL Nirenberg\n, J Stoker and E\n(\nEugene\n)\nIsaacson as well as\nJoe Keller\n. With regard to teaching back in Dundee, Douglas assigned lecturing duties that on the one hand one would enjoy and on the other he thought would be 'good for the soul'. On my return to Dundee he assigned to me a new course on approximation theory, which was being offered to the first graduate students on the new Numerical Analysis and Programming Masters Course. I knew absolutely nothing about approximation theory and thought that Douglas had made a mistake with the assignment. So, plucking up courage I decided to go and discuss the matter with him. After knocking on his door and waiting for the red light to turn blue, indicating entry, I was ushered in. 'Professor\nJones\n,' I said, 'you have assigned the Numerical Analysis and Programming course on approximation theory to me, but I know nothing about the subject.' His response was firm and short, 'Well you will do when you have given the course.'\nIn\n[\n1\n]\nSleeman writes the following about\nJoe Keller\n's influence on him during the year\n1970\n-\n71\nwhich he spent at the\nCourant\nInstitute:-\nSleeman was a visiting member of Joe's group and was greatly influenced by Joe's enthusiasm and ideas which led to his investigations into the rigorous justification of the geometrical theory of diffraction, an interest in nerve impulse transmissions as well as inverse problems.\nIn\n1967\nQueen's College, Dundee became the new University of Dundee. In the same year Sleeman was promoted to Lecturer in Mathematics, then promoted to Reader in Mathematics in\n1971\n. He spent the academic year\n1976\n-\n1977\nas a visiting professor at the University Tennessee, Knoxville, USA. A series of lectures he gave at the University of Tennessee at Knoxville in the spring of\n1977\nbecame the basis for his book\nMultiparameter spectral theory in Hilbert space\n(1978)\n(\nsee below\n)\n. In\n1978\nhe was promoted to Professor at the University of Dundee.\nOne of Sleeman's major contributions was assisting in the running of conferences on the 'Theory of Ordinary and Partial Differential Equations'. The first, held in Dundee from\n28\nto\n31\nMarch\n1972\n, had Proceedings published in the Springer Lecture Notes in Mathematics series with\nNorrie Everitt\nand Brian Sleeman as editors. They write in the Preface:-\nThese Proceedings form a record of the lectures delivered at the Conference on the Theory of Ordinary and Partial Differential Equations held at the University of Dundee, Scotland during the four days\n28\nto\n31\nMarch\n1972\n. The Conference was attended by\n140\nmathematicians from the following countries Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, The Netherlands, Poland, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States of America. ... The Conference was organised by the following committee:\nW N Everitt\n(\nChairman\n)\n, J S Bradley, B D Sleeman and I M Michael. Dr Sleeman and Dr Michael acted as Organising Secretaries for the Conference.\nSleeman was an editor of further conferences in the same series: the Conference held at the University of Dundee, Dundee,\n26\n-\n29\nMarch\n1974\n; the Fourth Conference held at the University of Dundee, Dundee,\n30\nMarch-\n2\nApril,\n1976\n; the Sixth Conference held at the University of Dundee, Dundee,\n31\nMarch-\n4\nApril,\n1980\n; the Seventh Conference held at the University of Dundee, Dundee,\n29\nMarch-\n2\nApril,\n1982\n; the Eighth Conference held at the University of Dundee, Dundee,\n25\n-\n29\nJune,\n1984\n; the Ninth Dundee Conference held at the University of Dundee, Dundee,\n30\nJune-\n4\nJuly,\n1986\n; the Tenth Dundee Conference held at the University of Dundee, Dundee, July\n1988\n; the Eleventh Conference held at The University of Dundee, Dundee,\n3\n-\n6\nJuly,\n1990\n; and the Twelfth Conference held in honour of Professor\nD S Jones\nat the University of Dundee, Dundee,\n22\n-\n26\nJune,\n1992\n.\nUp to\n1980\n, Sleeman's research was mostly in applied analysis, multiparameter spectral theory, direct and inverse scattering theory. Examples of his papers on these topics are\nIntegral equations and relations for LamÃ© functions and ellipsoidal wave functions\n(1968)\n,\nMulti-parameter eigenvalue problems in ordinary differential equations\n(1971)\n,\nThe three-dimensional inverse scattering problem for the Helmholtz equation\n(1973)\n,\n(\nwith G F Roach\n)\nGeneralized multiparameter spectral theory\n(1976)\n, and\nKlein oscillations theorems for multiparameter eigenvalue problems in ordinary differential equations\n(1979)\n. In\n1978\nhe published the book\nMultiparameter spectral theory in Hilbert space\n.\nGary Roach\nwrites\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nThis is only the second book to have been written which is devoted entirely to topics in the theory of multiparameter problems. As the title indicates this particular book is concerned more with spectral theory than with general multiparameter problems; nevertheless it makes a significant contribution to an area of research which over recent years has seen a considerable renewal of interest. Clearly written, in a readable and persuasive manner, it collects together most of the recent\nHilbert\nspace developments which have occurred in the subject. The book is divided into nine chapters. The first gives an introduction to multiparameter problems and provides some of the motivation for subsequent chapters. The second introduces certain basic notions and techniques which are necessary for the theoretical developments given in Chapters three to eight. The final chapter is devoted to a consideration of open problems.\nFor reviews and further information about this book, see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nDespite most of his papers being on these topics in applied analysis before\n1980\n, there were also a couple of papers on mathematical biology, for example\nFitzHugh's nerve axon equations\n(1975)\n. In\n1981\nhe published the paper\nAnalysis of diffusion equations in biology\nand in\n1983\nthe book, written jointly with\nDouglas Jones\n,\nDifferential Equations and Mathematical Biology\n. The publisher gave the following information about one of the editions of the book:-\nThe conjoining of mathematics and biology has brought about significant advances in both areas, with mathematics providing a tool for modelling and understanding biological phenomena and biology stimulating developments in the theory of nonlinear differential equations. The continued application of mathematics to biology holds great promise and in fact may be the applied mathematics of the\n21\nst century. Differential Equations and Mathematical Biology provides a detailed treatment of both ordinary and partial differential equations, techniques for their solution, and their use in a variety of biological applications. The presentation includes the fundamental techniques of nonlinear differential equations, bifurcation theory, and the impact of chaos on discrete time biological modelling. The authors provide generous coverage of numerical techniques and address a range of important applications, including heart physiology, nerve pulse transmission, chemical reactions, tumour growth, and epidemics. This book is the ideal vehicle for introducing the challenges of biology to mathematicians and likewise delivering key mathematical tools to biologists. Carefully designed for such multiple purposes, it serves equally well as a professional reference and as a text for coursework in differential equations, in biological modelling, or in differential equation models of biology for life science students.\nFor reviews and further information about this book, see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nIn\n1989\nSleeman published the paper\nComplexity in Biological Systems and Hamiltonian Dynamics\n. To obtain a feel for some of the topics which interested him we quote from the paper\n[\n4\n]\n:-\nIt is well known that in biology and the life sciences in general there are numerous instances of complex behaviour arising from apparently deterministic processes. One is familiar with the 'fractal' nature of the shapes of leaves and snowflakes. Such shapes may be described as the outcome of simple deterministic evolutionary dynamics. In another area the stochastic or chaotic response of stimulated cardiac nerve cells is well known and can be modelled by nonlinear deterministic systems of ordinary differential or difference equations. In most examples describing complex behaviour in biological systems the underlying models are either ordinary differential or difference equations leading to an analysis of temporal behaviour and its dependence on certain parameter values such as growth rates, generation times or reaction constants. In this paper we explore both the temporal and spatial nature of complex phenomena in biological systems. The examples involve partial differential or partial difference equations and are drawn from models of population genetics, mollusc shell patterning and excitable systems. In each situation we demonstrate aspects of complexity and show that non-integrable hamiltonian dynamical systems play a crucial role. This brings into the realms of biology such concepts as structural stability and\nKolmogorov\n-\nArnold\n-\nMoser\n(\nKAM\n)\ntheory\n[\nnamed for\nJÃ¼rgen Moser\n]\n, which lie at the heart of current developments in the theory of dynamical systems.\nIn\n1995\nSleeman left Dundee when he was appointed as Professor at the University of Leeds. He retired in\n2004\nand was honoured with a conference:-\nThe University of Dundee and the Mathematics Biomedical Network held this two day meeting in honour of Professor Brian Sleeman to mark the occasion of his\n65\nth birthday and to celebrate his contributions to many areas of applied mathematics over the last\n40\nyears. The meeting took place on Monday\n11\nth and Tuesday\n12\nth October\n2004\nat The West Park Conference Centre, University of Dundee. We organized a programme of\n12\nplenary talks given by internationally renowned speakers and spread over the two days with plenty of morning coffee, afternoon tea and lots of informal discussions. There was a special dinner on the Monday evening. We invited all of Brian's former PhD students and post-docs and many of his research collaborators from the last\n40\nyears and many of them were able to attend. The plenary speakers were drawn from people whom Brian had worked with over the years or whom he had known as colleagues over the years, or who were active in some of the main areas of research Brian worked in. The programme was divided into two broad areas: Mathematical Biology and Applied Analysis.\nAmong other honours given to Sleeman note he was elected a Fellow of the\nRoyal Society of Edinburgh\nin\n1976\n. He was founding editor of the journalÂ\nComputational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine\nwhich adopted this title in\n2006\nhaving been founded in\n1997\nas the\nJournal of Theoretical Medicine\n.\nFinally we note his interests in choral music and hill walking.",
