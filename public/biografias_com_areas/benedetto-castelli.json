  "biografia": "Benedetto Castelli\n's parents were Annibale Castelli, a wealthy landowner born in\n1553\nto Ortensio Castelli, and Alda Tiberi. Benedetto was not the name that he was given when he was baptised, rather it was Antonio. He took the name Benedetto in\n1595\nwhen he entered the Benedictine order. Antonio was the eldest of his parents' seven children; his six younger brothers were Ortensio, Vespasiano, Carlo, Ortensia, Lucrezia, and Quinto, while his sister Dorotea did not reach adulthood. The date of Antonio's birth is uncertain for we only know that he was ten years old in\n1588\n, meaning he was born in\n1577\nor\n1578\n. It was certainly not a happy family for three of the brothers met violent deaths after becoming involved in quarrels, while the youngest brother Quinto was banished from the Republic of Venice after committing various crimes. The ban was lifted only after Carlo and Benedetto, as the subject of this biography was called by this time, paid a large sums of money to allow Quinto to return.\nCastelli joined the Benedictine order in the monastery of Saints Faustino and Giovita in Brescia on\n4\nSeptember\n1595\n. He began studying mathematics while in Brescia but, after he was transferred to the monastery of Saint Giustina in Padua, he came into contact with\nGalileo\n.\nGalileo\nhad been appointed as professor of mathematics at the University of Padua\n(\nthe university of the Republic of Venice\n)\nin\n1592\nand he lived near to Saint Giustina.\nGalileo\nwas a personal friend of the abbot and frequently met with the monks in the monastery. Although exact details are unclear, we know that before\n1604\nCastelli had attended lectures by\nGalileo\nand watched him making various experiments, particularly with the thermometer. Castelli later described what he saw in\n1603\n:-\n[\nGalileo\n]\ntook a small glass flask, about as large as a small hen's egg, with a neck about two spans long and as fine as a wheat straw, and warmed the flask well in his hands, then turned its mouth upside down into a vessel placed underneath, in which there was a little water. When he took away the heat of his hands from the flask, the water at once began to rise in the neck, and mounted to more than a span above the level of the water in the vessel. Galileo had then made use of this effect in order to construct an instrument for examining the degrees of heat and cold.\nAt first Castelli was certainly one of\nGalileo\n's students, but later the two became close friends. When Castelli was sent to the Benedictine abbey of La TrinitÃ  della Cava in the Finestre Hills outside Cava dei Tirreni in\n1607\nhe corresponded regularly with\nGalileo\nand, when he was in Brescia in\n1610\n, he wrote to\nGalileo\nthanking him for the copy of\nSidereus Nuncius\nâ\n(\nThe starry messenger\n)\n. By the time he wrote the letter he had already read, and greatly enjoyed,\nGalileo\n's book. On\n5\nDecember\n1610\nCastelli wrote to\nGalileo\n(\nsee\n[\n21\n]\n)\n:-\nIf the position of\nCopernicus\n, that Venus revolves around the sun, is true\n(\nas I believe\n)\n, it is clear that it would necessarily sometimes be seen by us horned and sometimes not, even though the planet maintains the same position relative to the sun. ... Now I want to know from you if you, with the help of your marvellous glasses, have observed such a phenomenon, which will be, beyond doubt, a sure means to convince even the most obstinate mind. I also suspect a similar thing with Mars near the quadrature with the sun; I don't mean a horned or non-horned shape, but only a semicircular and a more full one.\nIt is now impossible to prove whether this idea occurred to both\nGalileo\nand Castelli at the same time, or whether this letter of Castelli made\nGalileo\nturn his telescope on Venus to see if it showed phases. Certainly by\n11\nDecember\nGalileo\nhad discovered that Venus did indeed appear as a crescent for on that day he wrote to Giuliano d'Medici expressing the discovery in code. It is of little consequence which scenario is correct, for in either case Castelli came up with one of the most important ideas of the time. To complete the story of this episode, let us quote from\nGalileo\n's reply to Castelli written towards the end of December\n[\n21\n]\n:-\nO how many consequences and ones of such import have I deduced, my Master Benedetto, from these and from my other observations. You almost made me laugh when you said that with these manifest observations the obstinate could be convinced. Well then, don't you know that to convince those capable of reason and anxious to know the truth the other demonstrations already produced were enough, but to convince the obstinate who care only for the empty applause of the stupid and dull crowd, the testimony of the stars themselves, come down to earth to discuss themselves, would not suffice? Let us then endeavour to learn something for ourselves and rest satisfied with this alone, but as for advancing ourselves in popular opinion or gaining the assent of philosophers in books, let us give up the desire and the hope.\nCastelli continued to study mathematics with a view to becoming a teacher, making a deep study of the works of\nEuclid\n,\nPtolemy\n,\nTheodosius\nand\nArchimedes\n. He was particularly keen to return to Padua so that he could learn more from\nGalileo\nbut, around this time,\nGalileo\nresigned his post at Padua and moved to Florence becoming Chief Mathematician at the University of Pisa\n(\nwithout any teaching duties\n)\nand 'Mathematician and Philosopher' to the Grand Duke of Tuscany. Castelli, therefore, requested a transfer to Florence where\nGalileo\nwas based and, in\n1611\n, he went to Santa Maria di Firenze, the Benedictine abbey\n(\ncalled the Badia\n)\nlocated in the centre of Florence. He discussed with\nGalileo\nhis observations of sunspots and it was Castelli who suggested that\nGalileo\nmight find them easier to observe by using a telescope to project the sun's image onto a sheet of paper. While in Florence, Castelli gave private mathematics lessons.\nIn\n1613\nCastelli was appointed as professor of mathematics at the University of Pisa, succeeding Antonio Santucci, having been recommended by\nGalileo\n. He quickly gained a reputation as a fine teacher, and students came from many different regions to study with him. A significant event occurred in December\n1613\n, not long after he took up the appointment. In a letter he wrote to\nGalileo\non\n14\nDecember, he described an invitation to breakfast at the Tuscan court which was meeting in Pisa:-\nOn Thursday morning I had breakfast with our Lordships, and, when asked about school by the Grand Duke Cosimo II de' Medici, I gave him a detailed account of everything, and he seemed to be very satisfied. He asked me whether I had a telescope, and I said \"Yes\" and so began to tell him about the observation of the Medicean planets\n[\nthe four moons of Jupiter discovered by\nGalileo\na few years earlier\n]\nwhich I had made just the previous night. Then Her Most Serene Ladyship, the Grand Duchess Dowager Christina\n[\nmother of the Grand Duke Cosimo II\n]\ninquired about their position and began saying to herself that they had better be real and not deceptions of the instrument. So their Highnesses asked Cosimo Boscaglia\n[\na Platonist and Professor of Logic and Philosophy at Pisa\n]\n, who answered that in truth their existence could not be denied. I used the occasion to add whatever I knew and could say about your wonderful invention and your proof of the motions of these planets. ... As soon as I had come out of the palace, the porter of Her Most Serene Ladyship caught up with me and called me back. However, before I say what followed, you must know that at the table Boscaglia had been whispering for a long time in Her Ladyship's ear; he admitted as true all the celestial novelties you have discovered, but he said that the earth's motion was unbelievable and could not happen, especially since the Holy Scripture was clearly contrary to this claim. Now, to get back to the story, I entered the chambers of Her Highness, where I found the Grand Duke, Her Ladyship, the Archduchess\n[\nthe Grand Duke Cosimo II's wife, Maria Maddalena of Austria\n]\n, Don Antonio, Don Paolo Giordano, and Boscaglia. At this point, after some questions about my views, Her Ladyship began to argue against me by means of the Holy Scripture. I first expressed the appropriate disclaimers, but then I began to play the theologian with such finesse and authority that you would have been especially pleased to hear. ... The Grand Duke and the Archduchess were on my side and Don Paolo Giordano came to my defence with a very appropriate passage from the Holy Scripture. Only Her Ladyship contradicted me, but in such a way that I thought she was doing it in order to hear me. Cosimo Boscaglia remained silent. ... As I was leaving ...\n[\nDon Antonio\n]\nexplicitly uttered these words: \"Write to\nGalileo\nabout my having become acquainted with you and about what I said in the chambers of Her Highness.\" I answered that I would report to you about this beautiful opportunity I have had to serve you. ...\nGalileo\nreplied to Castelli in a letter written on\n21\nDecember. What he wrote in this letter was significant since it, and his subsequent\nLettera a Madama Cristina di Lorena Granduchessa di Toscana\nâ\n(\nLetters to  Madam Cristina of Lorena, Granduchess of Tuscany\n)\n(1615)\nin which he further amplified his views on science and religion, would be used by the Inquisition in their case against him. There was no Benedictine convent so Castelli lived in Pisa in the Jesuati monastery of San Girolamo. In\n1616\nBonaventura Cavalieri\ncame to live in the San Girolamo monastery and he was taught mathematics by Castelli who introduced him to the ideas of\nGalileo\n. Castelli was careful in his teaching in Pisa, where he was forced to teach that the earth was stationary. From\n1617\non, he corresponded with Cardinal Federico Borromeo, and was also employed by the Tuscan Court on various committees. He was ordered by the Grand Duke of Tuscany to make a sea voyage with the aim of testing the celatone, a device invented by\nGalileo\nfor determining longitude using observations of the moons of Jupiter. This was an unpleasant experience for Castelli, who suffered severely from seasickness, and, despite his best efforts, the celatone did not achieve success. In\n1618\nthree comets appeared and Archduke Leopold V of Austria demanded to know about comets. Castelli, and later\nGalileo\n, gave the Archduke their opinions.\nIn\n1624\nCastelli's appointment as professor at Pisa was confirmed as one for life. However, he only remained there for two more years before moving to Rome. In fact he had visited Rome in\n1623\nwhen Cardinal Maffeo Barberini became Pope Urban VIII. At this time he was appointed to take care of the waterways of Ferrara and Bologna. He was already interested in hydraulics and, after returning to Pisa, undertook new research on the topic. He made frequent trips to Florence to discuss hydraulics with\nGalileo\n, and also corresponded regularly with him on this topic. He left his professorship in Pisa in\n1626\nwhen the pope called him to Rome as an adviser on waterways and on mathematics, as well as employing him as a tutor to his young nephew, Taddeo Barberini. His pupil's elder brother, Francesco Barberini, arranged for Castelli's appointment as reader in mathematics at La Sapienza university in\n1627\n. His students in Rome included\nGiovanni Alfonso Borelli\nand\nEvangelista Torricelli\n.\nIn\n1628\nCastelli published\nDella misura dell'acque correnti\nâ\n(\nOn measuring running water\n)\n, his famous book on hydraulics. The work is in two parts, one dedicated to pope Urban VIII, the other to Taddeo Barberini. Many historians suggest this work inaugurated modern hydrodynamics. Maffioli writes\n[\n20\n]\n:-\nCastelli's 'Della misura dell'acque correnti'\n(1628)\nstood out from contemporary engineering practices and deep-rooted philosophical beliefs such as that of the condensation of water. This second notion has not yet been fully acknowledged because Castelli only hinted at it by criticizing Giovanni Fontana's measurements of the Tiber and his use of the term 'acqua premuta'. The acknowledgment of the incompressibility of water was nonetheless an essential prerequisite of Castelli's mathematical formulation of the continuity law of running water.\nGalileo\nwas in Rome in May-June\n1630\nattempting to get\nDialogue Concerning the Two Chief Systems of the World - Ptolemaic and Copernican\npublished; he was made very welcome by Castelli during his visit. In\n1631\n, while in Pesaro, Castelli wrote to\nGalileo\n. It tells us something of the society that Castelli moved in at this time and also of his continued support for\nGalileo\nand his ideas\n[\n15\n]\n:-\nHe writes from Pesaro, where the court was sojourning while Cardinal Antonio Barberini\n[\nanother brother of Taddeo Barberini and Francesco Barberini\n]\nsupervised the transfer of the vacant duchy of Urbino to the Papal State. He remarks with wry amusement on the gay times had by the many knights and gentlefolk in the cardinal's entourage, while he devoted himself instead to the solution of hundreds of equations. One day he was approached by a group of literate gentlemen who wanted to be taught the principles of geometry. Some of these dilettantes he found to be unusually intelligent. But when he recounted the merits of\nGalileo\n's work they were at first stunned, and were \"most contrary to your name and your work, of which either they knew nothing at all or which they had learned in a distorted fashion. But now they are studying away with gusto.\"\nGalileo\nwas summoned to Rome in\n1633\nand at this time Castelli was sent to Brescia to support his brother Quinto who was sentenced to seven years in prison. By the time Castelli returned to Rome, he was very upset to discover that\nGalileo\nhad been found guilty and condemned to lifelong imprisonment. Castelli became increasingly uncomfortable in his position in Rome. He continued to correspond with\nGalileo\nbut his letters written in this period are sad and melancholy. We should understand, of course, why the Inquisition found it necessary to proceed against\nGalileo\n. It was not really about his belief in the heliocentric system. For example Castelli was a believer in the heliocentric system yet the Inquisition did not proceed against him. Rather it was all about authority - the Church saw in\nGalileo\nsomeone who had challenged their authority. Unhappy and out of favour in Rome, Castelli attempted to move to be near to his friend\nGalileo\n. For example, a letter written by Castelli\n(\npublished in\n[\n2\n]\n)\nshows how he felt\n[\n17\n]\n:-\nThe single letter to\nGalileo\n(\nreproduced in\n[\n2\n]\n)\nhappens to be one of the longest in the volume. Dated\n13\nJune\n1637\n, it is a detailed report on the failure of Castelli's apparent attempt to move out of Rome and be closer to\nGalileo\n. For about a dozen years Castelli had been teaching at the University of Rome under the patronage of the pope\n(\nMaffeo Barberini\n)\nand his nephew\n(\nCardinal Francesco Barberini\n)\n, but at a general convention of Benedictines that year Castelli\n(\nwho belonged to this order\n)\nhad been appointed abbot of a convent near Padua with the duty of being in residence there; however, the decision was not implemented because of the opposition of the Barberinis.\nTo keep him in Rome he was entrusted, in a purely formal capacity, with the four abbeys of S. Benedetto in Foligno, of S. Grisogono of Zara in Verona, of S. Maria of Praglia in Monreale, and of SS. Benedetto and Luigi in Palermo. Despite having to remain in Rome, Castelli continued to do fine science and to keep in contact with\nGalileo\n. For example, in a\n1637\nletter to\nGalileo\n, Castelli describes experiments where a brick was half painted white and half black, then exposed to heat from a fire and to light from the sun. He summarised his important findings\n[\n7\n]\n:-\n... the heat which proceeds from light only, heats up much more noticeably the black than the white. On the other hand, the heat from fire without light heats up equally the white and the black, while heat which originates from fire with light heats up a little more the black than the white. From a careful observation of these data and from other findings in nature, we see a great difference in the operation of these heats.\nAmong his other achievements, Castelli claimed first that the intensity of light varies as the square of the distance, and was the first person recorded to have invented a rain-gauge in\n1639\n. In the same year he wrote another remarkable work\n[\n10\n]\n:-\nIn\n1639\n-\n1640\nBenedetto Castelli wrote a treatise on the loadstone which is quite unlike any of its contemporaries. In it are the origins of the notion of elementary magnets sharing a common alignment, the idea that all materials are magnetic in different ways, and the first intimation of the concept of magnetic domains. Castelli did not publish his treatise. Nevertheless his work was noted during his lifetime, and may have exerted an influence on the development of magnetic theory in the\n17\nth\ncentury. The treatise was published in\n1883\n.\nIn\n1641\nhe left Rome, going to Pisa and Florence to greet\nGalileo\n, then going on to Venice for the general chapter meeting of Benedictines. While in Venice, he was asked to advise on the waterways there. He remained in Rome until his death in the monastery of S. Callisto from a disease of the bladder. He was buried in the basilica of S. Paolo fuoti le Mura, in the tomb of the Cassino monks.",
