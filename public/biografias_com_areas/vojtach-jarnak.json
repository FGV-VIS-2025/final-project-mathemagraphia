  "biografia": "VojtÄch JarnÃ­k\n's father was Jan Urban JarnÃ­k, the professor of Romanic philology at the Charles University of Prague. Jan Urban JarnÃ­k\n(1848\n-\n1923)\nhad graduated from the University in Vienna where he had studied Czech, German, French, Italian, English, Sanskrit and comparative grammar of Indo-European languages. From\n1882\nhe taught as a professor at the Czech University in Prague, where he founded a seminar on Romance philology. Jan Urban JarnÃ­k married Enrikou Eysselt-KlimpÃ©ly\n(\nborn\n1856)\nin\n1876\n. The first of their children was HertvÃ­k JarnÃ­k\n(1877\n-\n1938)\nwho followed his father in becoming a professor of Romanic philology in Brno. VojtÄch was the youngest of his parents' six children.\nJarnÃ­k attended the First Czech Real Gymnasium, similar to the German Realschule, in JeÄnÃ¡ Street in Prague. JirÃ­ Vesely writes\n[\n12\n]\n:-\nWe do not know whether JarnÃ­k's choice of school was connected with the wish to master modern languages or whether the choice was influenced just by the site of the school, which was located quite close to the place where the JarnÃ­ks were living at that time.\nWhatever his reason for attending this school the education he received there meant that he had problems with entering a university. He graduated from the Real Gymnasium on\n7\nJuly\n1915\n, but without having studied Latin. Latin was necessary for admission as a student at the Charles University in Prague where he wished to go to study mathematics and physics. However, he was admitted in\n1915\nas an extraordinary student, only becoming a properly registered student three semesters later after passing a Latin examination. He received an exemption from military service on\n17\nJanuary\n1917\n.\nAt the Charles University, JarnÃ­k attended mathematics lectures delivered by Karel Petr\n(1868\n-\n1950)\n, Bohuslav Hostinsky\n(1884\n-\n1951)\n, Karel RychlÃ­k\n(1885\n-\n1968)\n, Jan Sobotka\n(1862\n-\n1931)\n, Bohumil Bydzovsky\n(1880\n-\n1969)\nand VÃ¡clav LÃ¡ska\n(1862\n-\n1943)\n. He was most influenced by Karel Petr who had moved from Brno to Prague in\n1902\n. JarnÃ­k also attended physics lectures by Bohumil Kucera\n(1874\n-\n1921)\n, VÃ¡clav Posejpal\n(1874\n-\n1935)\n, VladimÃ­r VÃ¡clav Heinrich\n(1884\n-\n1965)\nand FrantiÅ¡ek ZÃ¡visÅ¡ka\n(1879\n-\n1945)\n. His university education was broad for, in addition to mathematics and physics, he took courses on philosophy, psychology, chemistry, Czech literature, and German literature. JarnÃ­k graduated from the Charles University in\n1919\n.\nAfter graduating, JarnÃ­k was appointed as an assistant to Jan VojtÄch\n(1879\n-\n1953)\nat the Technical University of Brno. Jan VojtÄch, after teaching in secondary schools in Prague, Olomouc, and Brno had taught at the Technical University of Brno from\n1916\n, being appointed as an extraordinary professor on\n25\nFebruary\n1918\n. His main mathematical interests were on the theory of transformations, the theory of plane curves of the sixth degree and\nprojective geometry\n. In Brno, JarnÃ­k met\nMatyÃ¡Å¡ Lerch\nwho influenced his mathematical development. While carrying out his duties in Brno, JarnÃ­k continued to work on his doctoral thesis and he submitted\nOn the roots of Bessel functions\n(\nCzech\n)\nto the Charles University in Prague and, after defending his thesis, was awarded his doctorate in\n1921\n.\nAfter the award of his doctorate, he returned to Prague where he was appointed as an assistant to Karel Petr. As Petr's assistant he worked on analysis and\nnumber theory\n. In particular he studied the number theory works of\nEdmund Landau\n. At this time Petr was writing his book\nPocet diferenciÃ¡lnÃ­\n(\ncÃ¡st analytickÃ¡\n)\nâ\n(\nDifferential Calculus\n)\nand JarnÃ­k helped with proof-reading but also made improvements to the text which Petr acknowledged in the published work. During this period JarnÃ­k published\nOn Bolzano's function\n(\nCzech\n)\n(1922)\nin which he\n[\n4\n]\n:-\n... proved among other that\nBolzano\n's function is in fact the oldest example of a continuous nowhere differentiable function.\nIn\n1923\nhe went to the University of GÃ¶ttingen to work with\nEdmund Landau\n. Returning to his post in Prague in February\n1925\n, later that year, in December, he moved from his assistant position to that of docent after submitting his habilitation dissertation\nO mÅÃ­Å¾ovÃ½ch  bodech v rovinÄ\nâ\n(\nOn lattice points in the plane\n)\n. He began lecturing, his first lecture course in\n1925\n-\n26\nwas '\nLebesgue\nIntegration', and, in the following year, he gave lectures as part of a course on 'Discussions on newer directions in mathematics'. He was again to visit GÃ¶ttingen in session\n1927\n/\n28\nwhen he again worked with\nEdmund Landau\n. One year after his return to Prague he was promoted to Extraordinary Professor. In\n1935\nhe was appointed to a chair of mathematics at the Charles University of Prague. He held this post until he retired in\n1968\nhaving taught at the University for a total of\n47\nyears.\nThe main topic of JarnÃ­k's research was number theory. One of the problems which he worked on extensively was related to the Gauss circle problem. Let\nR\n(\nr\n)\nR(r)\nR\n(\nr\n)\ndenote the number of points\n(\nm\n,\nn\n)\n(m, n)\n(\nm\n,\nn\n)\nwith\nm\n,\nn\nâ\nZ\nm, n \\in  \\mathbb{Z}\nm\n,\nn\nâ\nZ\ncontained in a circle centre O, radius\nr\nr\nr\n. There exists a constant\nC\nC\nC\nand a number\nk\nk\nk\nwith\nâ£\nR\n(\nr\n)\nâ\nÏ\nr\n2\nâ£\n<\nC\nr\nk\n.\n| R(r) - \\pi r^{2}| < Cr^{k}.\nâ£\nR\n(\nr\n)\nâ\nÏ\nr\n2\nâ£\n<\nC\nr\nk\n.\nLet\nd\nd\nd\nbe the minimal value of\nk\nk\nk\n.\nGauss\nproved in\n1837\nthat\nd\nâ¤\n1\nd â¤ 1\nd\nâ¤\n1\n.\nSierpinski\nimproved the inequality to\nd\nâ¤\n2\n3\nd â¤ \\large\\frac{2}{3}\\normalsize\nd\nâ¤\n3\n2\nâ\nin\n1904\n.\nLandau\nalso made important contributions and in\n1915\nHardy\nand\nLandau\nproved that\nd\n>\n1\n2\nd > \\large\\frac{1}{2}\\normalsize\nd\n>\n2\n1\nâ\n. In\n1923\nit was proved that\nd\n<\n2\n3\nd < \\large\\frac{2}{3}\\normalsize\nd\n<\n3\n2\nâ\n.\nJarnÃ­k and\nLandau\nstudied the same problem for curves and surfaces other than circles. Here one is interested in the difference between the number of lattice points within the closed surface and the volume enclosed by the surface. JarnÃ­k showed that for certain closed curves the error term does have\nd\n=\n2\n3\nd = \\large\\frac{2}{3}\\normalsize\nd\n=\n3\n2\nâ\n. He studied the problem for the particular case of the ellipsoid in a series of papers.\nAnother area of number theory which interested JarnÃ­k was\nDiophantine approximation\n. He wrote papers on this topic spanning the years\n1928\nto\n1969\n. During the decade\n1939\n-\n49\nhe wrote a series of papers dealing with the geometry of numbers, in particular dealing with\nMinkowski\n's inequality for convex bodies.\nAround\n60\nof JarnÃ­k's\n90\npapers were written on number theory. Many of the others were written on functions of a real variable, particularly during the years\n1933\n-\n36\n, where he studied\nDini\nderivatives and approximate derivatives of continuous functions. He also wrote on rearrangement of infinite series, trigonometric series and other areas of analysis. Two of his lesser known works are discussed in\n[\n3\n]\n. These are\nO jistÃ©m problÃ©mu minimÃ¡lnÃ­m\nâ\n(\nOn a certain minimal problem\n)\n(1930)\nin which he presented a simpler proof of the Minimal Spanning Tree Problem first solved by O Boruvka in\n1926\n. The second paper, written jointly with M KÃ¶ssler, is\nO minimÃ¡lnÃ­ch grafech obsahujÃ­cÃ­ch n danych bodu\nâ\n(\nOn minimal graphs containing n given points\n)\n(1934)\n[\n3\n]\n:-\n... the first two sections ... are devoted to general properties of \"\nSteiner\ntrees.\" It appears that virtually all general properties of\nSteiner\ntrees are explicitly stated in\n[\nthe paper\n]\n. Even today they are attributed to others and even today one can find in\n[\nthis paper\n]\narguments superior to those in common use ...\nThere was already tension around the Charles University from the beginning of\n1938\n, with everyone worrying about German aggression. In September\n1938\nthe Munich agreement was signed by Germany, France, the United Kingdom and Italy, allowing Germany to annex German speaking parts of Czechoslovakia which were then named the Sudetenland. After this, although the Charles University continued to operate, both staff and students were very nervous. What they all feared happened in March\n1939\nwhen German troops took over the whole of Czechoslovakia. On\n14\nMarch, with Prague covered in snow, JarnÃ­k burnt all his correspondence. On the following day Nazi troops took over Prague and closed the Charles University. Only in May\n1945\n, after the liberation of Prague, did the university again begin operating. At this time JarnÃ­k told all his colleagues:-\nForget about everything, get down to Mathematics again.\nJarnÃ­k then had the extremely arduous task of trying to reform and rebuild higher education in the Charles University and in the country as a whole. He was Dean of the Faculty of Science\n(1947\n-\n48)\n, Vice-Dean of the Faculty of Science\n(1948\n-\n49)\n, and Vice-Rector of the Charles University\n(1950\n-\n53)\n. He was a founder member of the\nCzechoslovak Academy of Sciences\nin\n1952\nand served as chairman of its Mathematical-Physical Section from\n1952\nto\n1955\n. He was chairman of the Academy's Mathematics Board during\n1964\n-\n66\n. The many administrative positions he held made finding time for teaching and research difficult but, of the two, it was teaching that took priority.\nLet us now look at some comments from JarnÃ­k's students, the first from before the Nazi takeover of Prague, the second soon after teaching began following the end of World War II.  Å tefan Schwartz entered Charles University in\n1932\nand began attending JarnÃ­k's lectures. He writes\n[\n10\n]\n:-\nJarnÃ­k knew exactly what we had learnt at secondary school. Therefore he started with inequalities and the absolute value.\n(\nNot, of course, such neck-breaking examples which are now forced into secondary-school subject matter by immature reformers.\n)\nHis lectures were transparent, delivered in a cultivated language. JarnÃ­k did not lecture \"slowly\", but no rush was ever felt. We felt that everything was well thought out and organized beforehand. I cannot remember whether he did ever consult his notes. In the first seminar he \"apologized\" several times that he would teach the theory of real numbers only in the second year. His lectures were accompanied with practical exercises named 'Elementary Problems of Higher Analysis', which he conducted himself. The lectures and practical exercises were attended by\n15\n-\n20\nstudents, who did not miss a single lecture; some\n5\n-\n10\nother students did not attend the lectures so regularly. JarnÃ­k was then\n35\nyears old. He was so \"tactful\" that he tried not to call us to the blackboard to solve problems: mostly we volunteered. He was extremely patient. At the oral examination after the first term I learnt that JarnÃ­k knew my name and also how I performed in the seminar of Prof BydÅ¾ovsky. In this way I discovered that even the teachers \"were gossiping\".\nTibor Å alÃ¡t entered the Faculty of Science of Charles University in the autumn of\n1946\nand, shortly after this, he attended lectures by JarnÃ­k\n[\n9\n]\n:-\nHis looks were the first thing that impressed me. He reminded me more of an elegant Frenchman than a Czech teacher, and many of my colleagues agreed with me. But it was his lectures, well thought out and adapted for beginning mathematicians, which left in me an unforgettable impression. Their influence accompanied me all my life as a University teacher. His famous tactfulness manifested itself at seminars\n(\nwhich he led himself\n)\namong other ways by his reluctance to force students to go to the blackboard to solve examples, even if it was their duty to do so. Those who willingly volunteered were rewarded by having to answer only theoretical questions in the examination, not also having to solve numerical examples. Let me note that at that time only students on scholarships had to pass these so called \"partial\" examinations. Nonetheless, all students preparing for teacher's career had to pass the so called state colloquia preceding the state examinations.\nAgain in\n[\n7\n]\nBretislav NovÃ¡k writes of JarnÃ­k's teaching and his care of young mathematicians:-\nAn outsider could get the impression that Professor JarnÃ­k has few students, that he did not establish his own school as other mathematicians of his stature usually did. However, the fact is that practically all today's Czech mathematicians can be considered directly or indirectly JarnÃ­k's students, and that everybody in this country who is engaged in Mathematics has been, to a greater or smaller extent, influenced by JarnÃ­k's personality. Professor JarnÃ­k was aware of the fact that, for the sake of our Mathematics, it was of much greater importance to pass to a large number of young people an affection for Mathematics and to give them firm foundations both in knowledge and methods of scientific work than to educate a few narrow specialists in his own field. In the same way, he preferred filling in the gaps in our mathematical literature to writing himself ten or twenty research papers.\nPerhaps one of the best indications of JarnÃ­k's dedication to training young mathematicians is the fact that he supervised the doctoral dissertations of\n37\nstudents.\nJarnÃ­k's character is described in\n[\n6\n]\n:-\nJarnÃ­k was an outstanding teacher who was able to transmit his enthusiasm for mathematics to his students. ... his profound humane erudition, his tact and his pure human character resulted in an admiration and deep respect from all who have known him personally.\nAnother description of his character is given in\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nAcademician JarnÃ­k is a modest man, sometimes too modest, who always and under all circumstances behaves with the utmost tact. Never and to no one does he show his professional superiority. He is patient, sometimes even too patient. In situations when much younger and much less experienced colleagues lose their temper, JarnÃ­k keeps his head. In addition to high intelligence and capability to assess all matters in a wider context, this also requires lots of trained personal discipline and willpower which not everyone possesses. For these rare qualities, JarnÃ­k is not only respected and appreciated by all his friends but also they make him really very popular. He has broad knowledge of culture, a passion for music and has been regular visitor to Prague concert halls for several decades. He plays tennis well, is a fair skier, and loves Nature and hiking.\nIn\n[\n12\n]\nÅ tefan Schwartz wrote:-\nWhenever it was possible I never missed an opportunity to talk with him, to ask him for his opinion. It was always an enjoyable event for me. Even now, being myself well over seventy, I see in front of me a man with deep humane feelings, a man of clear character, such as I have rarely met throughout my life.\nAs well as being an editor of\nActa Arithmetica\nfrom the founding of the journal, JarnÃ­k was active in organising university education and scientific research throughout Czechoslovakia. He was honoured by many scientific societies, in particular being elected to the\nCzechoslovak Academy of Sciences\n. He was awarded a State Prize in\n1952\n.\nAs we noted above, JarnÃ­k retired from the Charles University in\n1968\n. Sadly he only had a short retirement before his death at the age of\n72\n. On\n16\nMarch\n1998\nthe Faculty of Mathematics and Physics of Charles University, the\nUnion of Czech Mathematicians and Physicists\n, and the Mathematical Institute of the\nAcademy of Sciences of the Czech Republic\njointly organised an international conference to celebrate the centenary of the birth of Vojtech JarnÃ­k. The book\n[\n1\n]\n, from which we have referenced papers\n[\n3\n]\n,\n[\n4\n]\n,\n[\n8\n]\n,\n[\n9\n]\n,\n[\n10\n]\n, and\n[\n12\n]\n, records some of the contributions to this conference. He has also been honoured by having the JarnÃ­k International Mathematical Competition named for him, see\n[\n14\n]\n.",
