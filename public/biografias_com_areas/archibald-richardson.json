The small village of Bullecourt is to the south of Arras. The first battles in April\n1917\nwere disastrously planned by the Allies and failed.

Richardson was awarded the D.S.O. for his bravery in the battle. He was seriously wounded in\n1918\nwhich left him an invalid for life.\nHe was appointed professor of mathematics at Swansea in\n1920\n.
