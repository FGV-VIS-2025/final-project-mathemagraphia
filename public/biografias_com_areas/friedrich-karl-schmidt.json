  "biografia": "Friedrich Karl Schmidt\nwas often known to his friends and colleagues as F-K and we will refer to him as F-K Schmidt through this biography. He attended a\nGymnasium\nin DÃ¼sseldorf, graduating in\n1920\n. His favourite subject at school had been mathematics but, at this stage, he also was also deeply interested philosophy. When he entered the Albert-Ludwigs University of Freiburg in the autumn of\n1920\n, he was still undecided whether he should specialise in mathematics or philosophy. He was taught mathematics by Lothar Heffter\n(1862\n-\n1962)\nwho strongly influenced him to specialise in mathematics and physics. Heffter, an expert on differential equations, complex analysis and analytic geometry, had been appointed to Freiburg in\n1911\nhaving previously been a full professor at RWTH Aachen and Kiel. F-K Schmidt, however, did not lose his interest in philosophy which he continued to study. As was typical of German students of this time, he did not remain at one university for his studies but went from Freiburg to Marburg where he spent the summer semester of\n1923\n. However, he returned to Freiburg where he studied for his doctorate with\nAlfred Loewy\nas his formal advisor. He was awarded the degree in\n1925\nfor his thesis\nAllgemeine KÃ¶rper im Gebiet der hÃ¶heren Kongruenzen\nâ\n(\nArbitrary fields in the domain of higher congruence\n)\nin which he generalised the first arithmetic part of\nEmil Artin\n's thesis. His oral examination was held on\n22\nMay\n1925\n.\nF-K Schmidt was strongly influenced by two mathematicians who were just a couple of years older than him, namely\nHelmut Hasse\nand\nWolfgang Krull\n. The influence was both through their mathematics and through personal contacts. Schmidt notes in the preface to his doctoral thesis that the topic was suggested by\nKrull\nwho had been, in practice, Schmidt's thesis advisor.\nKrull\nhad obtained his doctorate from Freiburg in\n1922\nand was a\nprivatdocent\nduring the time F-K Schmidt was undertaking research.\nHasse\n, who moved from Kiel to Halle in\n1925\n, corresponded with F-K Schmidt by letter -\n150\nletters from Schmidt to\nHasse\n, which begin in\n1926\n, were found in his papers at the time of his death. The influence of\nKrull\nand\nHasse\non F-K Schmidt can be seen in the outstanding work that he began to produce on the algebraic theory of function fields in one variable, on\nalgebraic number theory\nand on valuation theory. In the autumn of\n1926\n, he was appointed as an assistant to\nOtto Haupt\nat Erlangen and he\nhabilitated\nthere in the following year. His habilitation thesis,\nAbelian fields in the domain of higher congruences\nconsisted of two parts: Part I:\nAnalytic number theory\nin fields of characteristic p\n; and Part II:\nClass field theory for an algebraic function field of one variable with finite base field\n. He published the two parts of the thesis as separate papers, both appearing in\n1931\n. Peter Roquette writes\n[\n8\n]\n:-\n... the first part of F K Schmidt's Habilitationsschrift, i.e., the paper\n[\nAnalytic number theory in fields of characteristic p\n]\n, became fundamental for the development of the theory of function fields. ... The first main achievement of F K Schmidt is the discovery that the classical theorem of\nRiemann\n-\nRoch\non compact\nRiemann\nsurfaces can be transferred to function fields with finite base field. Actually, his proof of the\nRiemann\n-\nRoch\ntheorem works for arbitrary perfect base fields, not necessarily finite. ... F K Schmidt's second main achievement in\n[\nAnalytic number theory in fields of characteristic p\n]\nis the discovery that over a finite base field, the\nRiemann\n-\nRoch\ntheorem is intimately connected with the properties of his zeta function.\nWe should note at this point that, later,\nAndrÃ© Weil\nmade three conjectures that became known as the \"\nWeil\nConjectures\". The third of these conjectures was a generalisation of the\nRiemann\nhypothesis to\nzeta functions\n. The\nWeil\nConjectures were solved by\nPierre Deligne\nin\n1974\nand he was awarded a\nFields Medal\nfor this achievement at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Helsinki in\n1978\n.\nJean DieudonnÃ©\n, writing in\n[\n3\n]\nabout the solution of the\nWeil\nConjectures, states that F-K Schmidt was one of the main contributors of essential ideas to the ultimate solution.\nIn\n1927\nF-K Schmidt married Josefine Baumann, who had been a mathematics student in the same class as Schmidt at Freiburg. They had four children, Christa, Ursula, Elmar and Hanno. Christa and Elmar both went on to study mathematics, Elmar being awarded a doctorate in\n1969\nfor his thesis\nFunktionentheoretische Charakterisierung der Topologie im Raume der gemÃ¤ssigten Distributionen\nâ\n(\nfeature Theoretical characterization of the topology in the space of temperate distributions\n)\n.\nIn\n[\n9\n]\nPeter Roquette gives an interesting account\n(\nbased on F-K Schmidt's letters to\nHasse\n)\nof how F-K Schmidt solved an outstanding question in valuation theory:-\nIn the first week of February,\n1930\n, F K Schmidt gave a colloquium talk at the University of Halle at the invitation of\nHasse\n. The subject of the talk was the axiomatic description of those complete valued fields which admit local class field theory. On the occasion of this visit\nHasse\nhad posed\n(\namong other questions\n)\nthe\n[\nfollowing\n]\nquestion to F K Schmidt:\nIs it possible that a field K is complete with respect to two of its nonequivalent valuations?\nImmediately after his return to Erlangen. F K Schmidt sent a letter to\nHasse\nand said that now he can go farther than they were able to in Halle; he announces a more detailed letter soon. And already on\n14\nFebruary\n1930\nhe wrote:\nConcerning the questions which we discussed in Halle, I would like to write you about two items. The first item is the Theorem: If the field K is complete with respect to a discrete valuation D then D is uniquely determined in two ways. ...\nF K Schmidt explains, what is of course evident, that \"unique\" in this context means \"unique up to equivalence\" of valuations. He continues to give a proof of this theorem. At the end of the letter he says:\nNow I would like to think about whether a field can be complete with respect to two different valuations, which then of course cannot be discrete ...\nTwo weeks later, in a letter of\n29\nFebruary\n1930\n, F K Schmidt tells Hasse that now he has completely solved the problem, including the case of non-discrete valuations, and he attaches to his letter a corresponding manuscript. That manuscript is not preserved but we may assume that it coincides more or less with F K Schmidt's paper in the 'Mathematische Annalen'; Mehrfach perfekte KÃ¶rper\nâ\n(\nMultiple perfect fields\n)\n(1933)\n. At the annual meeting of the Deutsche Mathematiker Vereinigung in September\n1930\nin KÃ¶nigsberg, F K Schmidt gave a talk about\n[\nthis\n]\nquestion and his solution. Hasse attended that talk and made notes about it; the content of his notes reflect the results of F K Schmidt's\n[1933]\npaper.\nThe Nazis came to power in\n1933\nand this changed to face of German mathematics as they introduced their anti-Semitic legislation.\nEmmy Noether\nwas dismissed from her position in GÃ¶ttingen and, on\n29\nJuly\n1933\n,\nHermann Weyl\nbegan negotiating with F-K Schmidt trying to arrange for him to hold a visiting position at GÃ¶ttingen and give the algebra courses that\nEmmy Noether\nhad been giving.\nWeyl\n, however, resigned his position at GÃ¶ttingen before the deal was finalised but his replacement,\nFranz Rellich\n, continued the discussion with Schmidt who accepted the visiting position. Also in\n1933\n, F-K Schmidt succeeded\nRichard Courant\nas editor of Springer-Verlag's famous \"Yellow Series\" of mathematical monographs when\nCourant\nwas dismissed because he was Jewish. F-K Schmidt was a Roman Catholic, and not Jewish, but he was quickly out of favour with the Nazis when he refused to remove\nRichard Courant\n's name from the title page of the Springer series. He also maintained contacts with his Jewish colleagues which displeased the Nazis. His time at GÃ¶ttingen was difficult with continued arguments about which staff were \"politically correct\" and he was, for a time, temporary director of the Institute before\nHasse\ntook up the position.\nIn October\n1934\nF-K Schmidt was called to Jena as ordinary professor of mathematics and director of the mathematical institute. He continued to produce outstanding mathematical work and his paper\nZur arithmetischen Theorie der algebraischen Funktionen I. Beweis der Riemann-Rochschen Satzes fÃ¼r algebraische Funktionen mit beliebigem KonstantenkÃ¶rper\nâ\n(\nOn the arithmetic theory of algebraic functions I. Proof of Riemann-Roch theorem for algebraic functions with arbitrary constant field\n)\n(1936)\ncontains an important proof of the\nRiemann\n-\nRoch\ntheorem. Details are given by Ernst Kunz in\n[\n1\n]\n. An interesting episode, which took place in\n1939\n, is related to the setting up of\nMathematical Reviews\n. It is told by Volker Remmert in\n[\n6\n]\n(\nsee also\n[\n7\n]\n)\n:-\nSÃ¼ss\ntried to put direct pressure on the two publishers de Gruyter and Springer in order to induce them to fuse. But the Springer Verlag had its own plans, namely to discuss the situation with the Americans first and, if possible, to cooperate with the 'Mathematical Reviews'. Ferdinand Springer wanted to send his main mathematical adviser, Friedrich Karl Schmidt, to the United States as a spokesman for his interests in mathematical reviewing. When\nSÃ¼ss\nlearned about this, he pressed Dames in the Ministry of Education and Research to refuse Schmidt permission to travel ...\nSÃ¼ss\nwas strongly opposed to Schmidt's journey. Schmidt, he had said, still had close ties to Jewish emigrants, and he suggested that he,\nSÃ¼ss\nhimself, should go to the United States instead. ...\nSÃ¼ss\nexplicitly characterised the 'Zentralblatt' as a foundation of \"a group of Jewish mathematicians and their friends\" and suggested that Schmidt's travel permission should be revoked and immediately because Schmidt intended to leave for the States the following week. Two days later, on April\n29\n,\nSÃ¼ss\nphoned Kummer in Berlin to inquire, how things stood. When Kummer informed him that Schmidt had already left,\nSÃ¼ss\ntold him that to his knowledge Schmidt was only on his way to Bremen to board the ship, which was due from America on May\n1\nor\n2\n. Kummer did not take up the implication that Schmidt could still be stopped, but explained that his superior in the Ministry of Education and Research had definitely decided to let Schmidt go as he was not only to discuss 'Zentralblatt'-matters, but also to evaluate the atmosphere among American mathematicians and, if possible, to change their minds. It seems that\nSÃ¼ss\nlost his temper and told Kummer that this was an unsuitable job for Schmidt and that the ministry would have done better to get the opinion of somebody who knew what was going on. The decision to send Schmidt he said was asking for trouble. Schmidt went on his mission to the United States, but nonetheless the 'Mathematical Reviews' came into being in\n1939\n.\nIn fact, when he returned from the United States, F-K Schmidt wrote a report for the Ministry of Education and Research saying that the founding of\nMathematical Reviews\ncould still be prevented but fusing de Gruyter and Springer would anger the Americans pushing them into founding\nMathematical Reviews\n. The Ministry accepted Schmidt's report keeping de Gruyter and Springer separate but, in May\n1939\n, the\nAmerican Mathematical Society\nmoved to found\nMathematical Reviews\nwhich, when the Germans learnt of it, caused Schmidt problems. Soon after the start of World War II, in September\n1939\n,\nSÃ¼ss\naccused Schmidt of giving a false report after his return from the United States.\nStanford Segal writes in\n[\n2\n]\nabout F-K Schmidt's difficult time in Jena:-\nHis continuing conflict with the Nazi authorities in Jena led to his gradually being sidelined as institute director, and even to his removal from the university's examination committee. By late\n1941\n, the situation was such that Schmidt gave up his professorship at Jena and, with the help of applied mathematician Richard Grammel, found a position doing research on glider flight at Ainringen\n[\nnear Bad Reichenhall\n]\n, where he remained until the end of the war.\n[\nHe was\n]\nknown for his politeness, as well as his ironic humour ...\nAfter the end of World War II, in November\n1945\n, F-K Schmidt returned to his professorship at the University of Jena. In July\n1946\nhe wrote to Ferdinand Springer and asked him to write a letter of recommendation for him to the University of MÃ¼nster where he was being considered for a professorship\n[\n7\n]\n:-\nHe suggested that Springer mention that he had been known to cooperate with Jewish mathematicians as late as the end of\n1938\n, and that his journey to the United States in May\n1939\nhad been heavily opposed. In his letter of recommendation to the University of MÃ¼nster, Ferdinand Springer ... followed Schmidt's outline ...\nF-K Schmidt took up the chair at the University of MÃ¼nster from October\n1946\n. He was offered a chair by the Humboldt University in Berlin in\n1947\nwhich he turned down\n(\nhe spent a semester as a visiting professor there in\n1947)\nand he also turned down the offer of a chair from the University of Erlangen in\n1948\n. However, he was tempted by an offer from the University of Heidelberg which he took up in the summer of\n1952\n. He continued to teach at Heidelberg until\n1966\nwhen he was made Professor Emeritus. He married Dr Anna Breassu in\n1968\n.\nAs a lecturer F-K Schmidt was held in high regard. Dieter Puppe writes\n[\n5\n]\n:-\nAnyone who has attended a course by F-K Schmidt will not forget the enjoyment of his clear and sophisticated manner of performance down to the smallest detail. His lectures were always well attended, even if he delivered them at his preferred  time of very early in the morning, and even after his retirement. ...\nWe have indicated areas on which F-K Schmidt undertook research throughout this biography. However, for completeness we note that the authors of\n[\n4\n]\nput his work into seven areas:\n1\n. Algebraic function fields of one variable;\n2\n. Zeta functions;\n3\n. Class field theory;\n4\n. Valuation theory;\n5\n.\nGalois theory\nand algebraic equations;\n6\n. General field and ring theory; and\n7\n. Derivations and differentials. Among the honours that Schmidt received for this work we mention his election to the\nHeidelberg Academy of Sciences\nin\n1954\nand the honorary degree that he was awarded by the Free University of Berlin in\n1968\n.\nLet us end this biography with a tribute from Dieter Puppe\n[\n5\n]\n:-\nFor all his merits as a scholar and teacher, there is something else that gave rise to my admiration for him. I did not study with him, and my mathematical work has only a few points of contact with his area. But I got to know his wise decisions, his energy when doing the right thing, his sense of responsibility to the people entrusted to him, and the heartfelt courtesy with which he treated everyone. He was a role model, his counsel will be sorely missed, and the gap he leaves will be felt for painfully long.",
