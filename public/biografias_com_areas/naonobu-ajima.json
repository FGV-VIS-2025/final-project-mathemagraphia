  "biografia": "Naonobu Ajima\nis also known as\nAjima Chokuyen\n. He was addressed as Manzo and wrote under the name of Nanzan. He was born into the Shinjo clan. His father was chairman of the Treasury of the clan, and Ajima was born in the official Shinjo residence. At the age of twenty-three be became a samurai. The samurai were those of highest social position in Japan and, although at one time warriors, by the eighteenth century they were the filling the roles of being both leading administrators and educators. It was the samurai who ran schools to educate their children, and Japanese mathematicians of this period would have all come from the samurai class. In addition to his official work, he studied under Masatada Irie of the Nakanishi school. After this he studied mathematics and astronomy under Nushizumi Yamaji becoming a pupil of the\nSeki\nschool in Edo. He qualified from the school as a Master of Mathematics.\nAjima was over thirty years of age before he began his studies with Yamaji. While studying with him, Ajima wrote books on astronomy and helped his teacher to compile an almanac. It was only after Yamaji's death that Ajima began to write works on mathematics. At this time he became one of the fourth generation of masters of the\nSeki\nschool. Despite producing\n42\nhand-written books, copies of which were made by his students, he published nothing in his lifetime. However, his main work\nFukyu sampo\n(\nMasterpieces of Mathematics\n)\nsummarised his contributions and was intended as a book from which his pupils could learn the skills that he had acquired. The book had a preface written in\n1799\n, one year after Ajima's death, by Kasawa Makoto, one of his students. Although the intention was to publish the work then, it did not happen. Kasawa was a fine mathematician and he succeeded Ajima as a master of the\nSeki\nschool. He was certainly not Ajima's only star pupil for there were also excellent mathematicians such as Masatoda Baba and Hiroyasu Sakabe who continued the tradition of the\nSeki\nschool. This school of traditional Japanese mathematics thrived until\n1856\nwhen the first European mathematics text was published in Japan.\nAjima's work went towards geometry despite the strong algebraic numerical tradition in the\nSeki\nschool. He developed methods of integration, developing the 'yenri' method which had been devised earlier and was used to find the area of a circle using inscribed polygons in a similar manner to the methods of\nArchimedes\n. Ajima refined the method subdividing the chord of an arc into equal small segments, so producing a method similar to that of the definite integral. He presented this in\nKohai jutsu kai\n, giving a method which is the high point that traditional Japanese mathematics reached in methods of integration\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nAjima comes closest of any Japanese mathematician to a full theory of integration.\nImmediately after developing this method of integration, Ajima developed a method for computing volumes by double integration. The method was developed to solve the problem of finding the volume of the intersection of two cylinders and he presented it in\nEnchu kokuen jutsu\n.\nHe also worked on logarithms, but here there is some influence from European mathematics. A seven-figure book of logarithms,\nSuri seiran\n, was published in China in\n1723\n. It is almost certain that this work was inspired by European logarithm methods which had been brought to China by Jesuit missionaries. This book introduced logarithms into Japan and it is clear that Ajima had read the work since he uses some of the same notation in his own work on logarithms. He produced log tables which were designed for taking\n10\nth\nroots and powers of numbers. For this purpose he set the log of the\n10\nth\nroot of\n10\nto\n1\n. As an example of his methods, let us look at how he solves the problem of computing\n1\n0\n2.56\n10^{2.56}\n1\n0\n2\n.\n5\n6\n.\nHe proceeds in the following way. First he solves, working to\n14\ndecimal places,\nx\n10\n=\n10\nx^{10} = 10\nx\n1\n0\n=\n1\n0\n, obtaining\n1\n0\n0.1\n=\n1.25892541179417\n10^{0.1} = 1.25892541179417\n1\n0\n0\n.\n1\n=\n1\n.\n2\n5\n8\n9\n2\n5\n4\n1\n1\n7\n9\n4\n1\n7\n. Next he solves\nx\n10\n=\n1.25892541179417\nx^{10} = 1.25892541179417\nx\n1\n0\n=\n1\n.\n2\n5\n8\n9\n2\n5\n4\n1\n1\n7\n9\n4\n1\n7\nfrom which he obtains\n1\n0\n0.01\n=\n1.02329299228075\n10^{0.01} = 1.02329299228075\n1\n0\n0\n.\n0\n1\n=\n1\n.\n0\n2\n3\n2\n9\n2\n9\n9\n2\n2\n8\n0\n7\n5\n.

The first, the Gion shrine problem, he solved in an unpublished manuscript of\n1774\nentitled\nKyoto Gion Dai Toujyutsu\n(\nThe Solution to the Gion Shrine Problem\n)\n. Although his solution was unpublished, nevertheless Ajima became famous for his work on this problem. It had been posed in\n1749\nby Tsuda Nobuhisa and placed on a sangaku at the Gion shrine of Kyoto. Sangaku were wooden tablets which mathematicians painted with either a theorem or a problem, then hung them on display at a Shinto shrine or Buddhist temple. It was a method of communicating mathematics and stimulating further mathematics with challenge problems. The sangaku at the Gion shrine of Kyoto poses the following problem:\nIn this figure we have a segment of a circle on the chord\nA\nB\nAB\nA\nB\nof length\na\na\na\n. From the mid-point of\nA\nB\nAB\nA\nB\nwe draw a line perpendicular to\nA\nB\nAB\nA\nB\nto meet the circle. It has length\nm\nm\nm\n. To the left of this line we draw a square of side\nd\nd\nd\n, as shown, and to the right we draw a circle of radius\nr\nr\nr\n, as shown. Put\np\n=\na\n+\nm\n+\nd\n+\nr\np = a + m + d + r\np\n=\na\n+\nm\n+\nd\n+\nr\n, and\nq\n=\nm\n/\na\n+\nr\n/\nm\n+\nd\n/\nr\nq = m/a + r/m + d/r\nq\n=\nm\n/\na\n+\nr\n/\nm\n+\nd\n/\nr\n. The problems requires that we express\na\n,\nm\n,\nd\na, m, d\na\n,\nm\n,\nd\nand\nr\nr\nr\nin terms of\np\np\np\nand\nq\nq\nq\n. Tsuda Nobuhisa solved the problem with an equation of degree\n1024\n. Ajima's remarkable achievement was to reduce this to an equation of degree\n10\n. He was then able to solve specific examples numerically. A year after this fine achievement, Ajima was promoted to hold the position of \"gun bugyou\" or \"country magistrate\".\nThe second problem that we want to mention is the\nMalfatti\nProblem, which appears in\nFukyu sampo\n. It is today called the\nMalfatti\nProblem since it was posed in\n1803\nby\nGian Francesco Malfatti\n, but Ajima's contributions were made around\n30\nyears earlier. The problem is, given an arbitrary triangle, find how to place three non-overlapping circles so that the area of that part of the triangle not covered by a circle is a minimum.\nMalfatti\nassumed that the solution would involve three circles, each of which is tangent to the other two. It is precisely the problem of maximising the area of the three mutually tangent circles that Ajima solved in\nFukyu sampo\n. However,\nMalfatti\n's assumption is wrong and it was shown in\n1992\nthat to maximise the area of the three non-overlapping circles, they are never mutually tangent. This, of course, is not relevant to Ajima's problem which is only posed in terms of maximising the area of three non-overlapping mutually tangent circles.\nAfter Ajima's death, he was buried in the Jorin-jo Temple, Mita, Tokyo, and his grave can still be visited today.",
