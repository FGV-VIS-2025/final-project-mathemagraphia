He sat the Scottish Leaving Certificate examinations and passed Higher English, Mathematics, Latin, and Greek in June\n1893\n.\nHe then entered the University of Edinburgh, studying Latin, Mathematics and Natural Philosophy at Ordinary level in\n1893\n-\n94\n. In session\n1894\n-\n95\nhe studied the Ordinary courses in Chemistry and Political Economy, then in sessions\n1895\n-\n96\nand\n1896\n-\n97\nhe took Honours courses in Mathematics and Natural Philosophy. In the last of these two sessions he also took the Ordinary course in Education. Brown graduated with an M.A. with First Class Honours in Mathematics and Natural Philosophy in April\n1897\nand was awarded a B.Sc.\n(\nPure\n)\n, also in\n1897\n.\nBrown then taught as a Mathematics Master at Dundee High School for session\n1897\n-\n8\n, then went to Gonville and Caius College of the University of Cambridge. In\n1901\nBrown was Senior\nWrangler\n(\nranked first in the First Class\n)\n, and in Part II of the Mathematical Tripos in\n1902\nhe obtained a First Class.\nIn\n1903\nBrown was appointed as Professor of Applied Mathematics in the South African College. In\n1911\nhe married Mary Graham; they had a son and a daughter. He remained in Cape Town until his death in\n1947\n, but his status changed in\n1918\nwhen the South African College became the University of Cape Town.\nHe was a member of the\nEdinburgh Mathematical Society\n, joining the Society in December\n1898\n. He contributed papers to meetings of the Society such as\nOn the Ratio of Incommensurables in Geometry\nto the meeting on Friday\n9\nJune\n1905\nand\nRelation between the distances of a point from three vertices of a regular polygon\n, at the meeting on Friday\n11\nJune\n1909\n, communicated by\nD C McIntosh\n.\nBrown was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of South Africa in\n1918\n, was on its Council from\n1931\nto\n1935\nand again in\n1941\n, was its Honorary Treasurer from\n1936\nto\n1940\n, and President from\n1942\nto\n1945\n.
