  "biografia": "Elza Furtado Gomide\nwas the daughter of CÃ¢ndido GonÃ§alves Gomide\n(1880\n-\n1955)\nand Sofia Furtado\n(1885\n-\n1955)\nwho were cousins. Elza had a older sister, Clotilde Isabel Furtado Gomide\n(1922\n-\n1999)\n. CÃ¢ndido Gomide had studied engineering in France and then became a mathematics teacher in SÃ£o Paulo. He was professor of Arithmetic and Algebra at the SÃ£o Paulo State Gymnasium between\n1921\nand\n1951\n. Elza said in the interview\n[\n14\n]\n:-\nHe hated engineering. At that time, he studied engineering because there was no mathematics course. But he also had a family issue. In my grandfather's mind, he had an uncle called CÃ¢ndido, who was an engineer. Since my father was CÃ¢ndido and he should have been an engineer too.\nElza's paternal grandfather, who was a judge at the SÃ£o Paulo Court of Justice, had gone with all seven of his children to Switzerland but he died there and her grandmother returned to Brazil in\n1918\n. Following the death of Elza's maternal grandfather, Godofredo Josee Furtado, who had been a mathematics teacher at the Escola Normal in SÃ£o Paulo, Sofia had been taken by her mother, Maria Isabel Gomide, to France and then to Switzerland to study the piano. She became a pianist and a piano teacher.\nBoth Elza's parents had therefore spent years in French speaking countries and this strongly influenced her upbringing\n[\n11\n]\n:-\n... as a child, the family influence was much more French than anything else, so everyone spoke French.\nElza was educated at home until she was eleven years of age. She said in the interview\n[\n12\n]\n:-\n... at that time the pressure from the Catholic Church was very strong, and my parents feared that in primary school I would be discriminated against for not having the current religion.\nAt home, her mother taught her Portuguese, French, and a little German and history, while her father taught her mathematics, physics and chemistry. Her father had a large number of books in Portuguese, French and English, so, having plenty of freedom to read, she spent hours and hours exploring her home library. She also learnt to play the piano\n[\n12\n]\n:-\nWe had two wonderful ones! One, which was my mother's, was an upright Steinway, magnificent! And another, which had been an aunt's, my mother's sister, was an old quarter grand Erard. They were two wonderful pianos. The Erard stayed, but I learned to play the other. My mother taught me and my sister. They were remarkable: the two pianos ... and the books!\nThe family lived in a house on Rua Augusta, on the corner of Rua AntÃ´nio de QueirÃ³s. In fact Elza was born in that house. The Pinheiros river runs through SÃ£o Paulo and, from age five to twelve, Elza would swim in the river every day and she became a champion swimmer.\nIn\n1937\nGomide entered the SÃ£o Paulo State Gymnasium which was the only state gymnasium at the time, located on Rua do Carmo. At this school she was taught mathematics by her father whom she considered one of the best teachers at the school. In\n[\n12\n]\nshe spoke about having her father as a mathematics teacher at school:-\nHe was much stricter with me than with anyone else. But he was an excellent teacher; he was a famous teacher. He was stimulating and very demanding: he gave much more content than usual. I studied the theory of limits with him in my fifth year of high school, which was later taught in my freshman year of college. He gave my class lessons on limits, derivatives and was very keen on proofs, geometry ... And he understood it! He had studied in Europe, he knew more than most.\nThe other teacher who impressed her was Febor Gigovatti who taught biology. He later became professor at the Faculty of Medicine. Gomide graduated from the school in\n1941\nand applied to enter the University of SÃ£o Paulo. This University had been founded in\n1934\nas a combination of the newly founded Faculdade de Filosofia, CiÃªncias e Letras\n(\nFFCL\n)\nand Polytechnic School of Engineering. In order to study Medicine, Engineering or Law, it was necessary for students to have two further years training before entering the courses but for the FFCL this was not necessary and Gomide could begin studying there in\n1942\n.\nMathematics was the subject that Gomide had enjoyed most at Gymnasium and, with the excellent teaching of her father, she had taken that subject to a greater depth than any other. She decided, however, to enter the FFCL to study for a physics degree\n[\n18\n]\n:-\nElza became interested in Physics, influenced by the success and popularity of that science ...\nLet us note at this point that several biographies of Gomide\n(\nfor example\n[\n5\n]\nand\n[\n18\n]\n)\nclaim that the increased interest in physics in Brazil which led to her choosing that subject was due to the Brazilian CÃ©sar Lattes's part in the discovery of the Ï meson. This cannot be correct since Lattes's work on the Ï meson took place in\n1947\n.\nGomide soon realised that mathematics was the subject for her and not physics. She did, however, continue to study for her physics degree while taking courses in mathematics and graduated in\n1944\nwith a physics degree. By this time she had reached the third year of the mathematics courses and her abilities were such that she was invited by the Professor of Mathematics,\nOmar Catunda\n, to be his assistant. Gomide was awarded a bachelor's degree in mathematics in\n1945\n. We should now give some details about the Mathematics Department of the University of SÃ£o Paulo.\nThe University of SÃ£o Paulo was founded inÂ\n1934\nÂ and professors were brought to SÃ£o Paulo from France, Italy and Germany. The first mathematics professor that was brought was\nLuigi FantappiÃ¨\nwho travelled to Brazil from Italy in\n1933\n.\nCÃ¢ndido Silva Dias\nbegan studying mathematics at the Polytechnic School in\n1932\nand became one of\nFantappiÃ¨\n's first students. In\n1934\nOmar Catunda\nwas appointed as\nFantappiÃ¨\n's assistant and they collaborated on starting up the Mathematics Subsection of the Faculty of Philosophy, Sciences and Letters at the University of SÃ£o Paulo with\nFantappiÃ¨\nas its head. It later became the Institute of Mathematics and Statistics.\nGiacomo Albanese\nwas sent from Italy to Brazil inÂ\n1936\nto join the new University of SÃ£o Paulo Mathematics Department. He was appointed to the chair of Analytical, Projective and Descriptive Geometry.\nCÃ¢ndido Silva Dias\nwas appointed as\nFantappiÃ¨\n's assistant in\n1937\nand taught in the Mathematics Department for\n54\nyears retiring in\n1990\n.\nFantappiÃ¨\nreturned to Italy at the outbreak of World War II inÂ\n1939\nÂ when he was offered the Chair of Higher Analysis in the University of Rome, a position he held for the rest of his life.\nCatunda\nwas appointed, on an interim basis, as professor responsible for the chair of Mathematical and Higher Analysis, replacing\nFantappiÃ¨\n. This was the Mathematics department in which Gomide studied but there were changes from\n1945\nwhen she became\nCatunda\n's assistant. In that year,\nAndrÃ© Weil\nwas appointed to\nFantappiÃ¨\n's chair which\nCatunda\nhad filled on a temporary basis.\nCatunda\n, with a scholarship from the Rockefeller Foundation, spent\n1946\n-\n47\nat Princeton University and\nJean DieudonnÃ©\nwas appointed professor of mathematics at SÃ£o Paulo for\n1946\n-\n47\nbut it was Gomide who took over teaching\nCatunda\n's Mathematical Analysis course. One of the students taking this course was\nCarlos Benjamin de Lyra\n, who was an undergraduate between\n1946\nand\n1950\n.\nGomide undertook research for her doctorate, the topic being suggested by\nAndrÃ© Weil\nwho left SÃ£o Paulo in\n1947\n. After that she was advised by\nJean Delsarte\nwho spent four summer months as Professor at the University of SÃ£o Paulo in each of the years\n1948\n,\n1949\n,\n1950\n,\n1951\n. Although much advice came from\nAndrÃ© Weil\nand especially\nJean Delsarte\n, it was in fact\nOmar Catunda\nwho was officially Gomide's research advisor. Speaking of her advisors, Gomide said in the interview\n[\n13\n]\n:-\nI was lucky enough to be guided by a\nBourbaki\n,\nJean Delsarte\n.\nDelsarte\nwas a lesser-known\nBourbaki\n, but of those who were here he was - perhaps - the one who was most concerned with the transmission of knowledge. Something that\nWeil\n, for example, was less good at. If we took advantage of his science that was very well, but if we didn't, so much the worse; it wasn't his concern ...\nHer\n24\n-page thesis\nSobre o teorema de Artin-Weil\nâ\n(\nOn the Artin-Weil theorem\n)\nwas typed with all mathematical symbols, Greek letters, etc. written in by hand. Even the title and her name on the cover are handwritten. She defended her thesis on\n27\nNovember\n1950\nbefore the examining committee which had\nOmar Catunda\nas chair and also included Fernando Fuquim de Almeida\n(1913\n-\n1981)\n, Edison Farah\n(1915\n-\n2006)\n, Benedito Castrucci\n(1909\n-\n1995)\nand Joao Augusto Breves Filho. The thesis begins with a statement of the\nArtin\n-\nWeil\nConjecture which, she writes, came about as the result of studying manifolds over finite fields. She then writes:-\nThis conjecture has been demonstrated for curves and for other varieties of a particular type.\n(\nA Weil\n, 'Les Courbes AlgÃ©briques et les variÃ©tÃ©s qui s'en dÃ©duisent'\nâ\n(\nAlgebraic Curves and the varieties derived from them\n)\n, and 'Numbers of Solutions of Equations in Finite Fields'\n)\n. This work contains research on this conjecture.\nWhen Gomide was awarded a doctorate in\n1950\nshe became the first woman to be awarded a doctorate by the University of SÃ£o Paulo and only the second woman to be awarded a doctorate by a Brazilian university; the first being\nMarÃ­lia Chaves Peixoto\nin\n1948\nwho married the mathematician\nMaurÃ­cio Matos Peixoto\n. Gomide's thesis was published in the\nBoletim da Sociedade de MatemÃ¡tica de SÃ£o Paulo\n.\nAfter the award of her doctorate, Gomide went to Paris to undertake postdoctoral work. Speaking of her time in France, Gomide said in the interview\n[\n12\n]\n:-\nThey don't have entrance exams there. Passing the baccalaureate, one enters the university. The university's mathematics course does not train its future teachers. Almost no mathematician has taken the university course. Next to the university, they have the elite institutions, which are the 'grande Ã©coles'. These have a very tough entrance examination, which actually starts from high school. Those who are very good, already start in special classes and end up being able to go to the Ãcole National de Administration, from where presidents, ministers, etc. come out; to the Ãcole Polytechnique, which produced the top people before they started to be produced by the Ãcole Normale SupÃ©rieur, which trains researchers in mathematics and physics. I believe the French university system cannot be copied; for it is a very peculiar model.\nShe spoke about the beginnings of her teaching career in\n[\n12\n]\n:-\nIt didn't take long for me to start teaching a class. It so happens that\nCatunda\nwent to the United States for an internship and during his absence Lyra and I took theoretical classes. That was maybe in the early\n50\n's\n[\nNote by EFR: actually it was\n1946\n-\n47]\n. I mean that after four or five years I already took classes, and since then I've continued ... I think it was there, when he went to the United States, that I started to take theoretical classes. That was the common relationship. At first the assistant did exercises and studied; and gradually, over time, they would take over the classes as well. ... I started teaching calculus exercises -\nCatunda\ngave the theoretical part, and I taught the exercises as his assistant. Sometimes I attended his class; he would then prepare the exercises I was going to do. I think it was four exercise classes a week. There were a lot of classes, four theoretical and four exercises... something like that.\nEven while she was\nCatunda\n's assistant, Gomide felt that she wanted to change the way that teaching was being done.\nFantappiÃ¨\nhad set up a syllabus which began with the construction of the real numbers and\nCatunda\nhad carried on using\nFantappiÃ¨\n's syllabus. When Gomide started to study mathematics this was how the lessons were structured. She explained\n(\nsee\n[\n15\n]\n)\n:-\nThe course started with the construction of real numbers. This is a beautiful construction, but extremely elaborate. I remember very well that I thought the idea of\nDedekind\ncuts was wonderful, but making the students' first contact with calculus by defining operations and their properties based on the notion of cuts is a tragedy! ... It was over the students' heads. ... The course only began to be of interest when it entered the notions of derivative and integral.\nShe persuaded\nCatunda\nto change the approach\n[\n15\n]\n:-\nThe Mathematical Analysis course should be given after the Differential and Integral Calculus course; first give a course in Calculus without criticism and then do Analysis, which is actually the justification, the critique of Calculus, with all the theorems, the construction of real numbers, etc. After all, how could students directly understand the criticism of something they didn't even know yet? ... I insisted with\nCatunda\nthat it was better to start with Calculus than with Analysis and he agreed. He was very liberal; very few full professors gave their assistants the freedom he afforded us.\nHer career in the Institute of Mathematics and Statistics in the University of SÃ£o Paulo is described in\n[\n7\n]\n:-\nHer room at the Institute of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of SÃ£o Paulo was always open, whether she was inside or not. When the place was empty, colleagues simply went in to borrow a book or read the newspapers. Whoever found her there took the opportunity to talk or ask for some of her wise advice. For professors at the Institute of Mathematics and Statistics, that unlocked door symbolised their open and creative thinking. From her election to head of the Mathematics Department in\n1968\n, during the military regime, she began to act more in matters related to teaching. She had begun to take an interest in the question when she realised that modern mathematics, in her own words, \"was doing a lot of damage.\" She became very involved when the Ministry of Education decided to impose the Licentiate in Science, which she thought would be extremely harmful, especially to Mathematics. This involvement, added to the problems caused by the political situation, with threats from the military regime on the one hand and the pressure of student ferment on the other, made her no longer available for research activities. According to her, at the time it was already very difficult to \"keep your nose above water\". The separation of the Bachelor and Licentiate courses in Mathematics was finally effected in the late\n1960\ns.\nAs head of mathematics at the University of SÃ£o Paulo, Gomide worked so hard that it affected her social life. She said\n(\nsee\n[\n16\n]\n)\n:-\n... this is not just any job, we start at nine in the morning and finish at five in the afternoon. Either you are engaged, absorbed in work, or you are not. If you are, it sometimes damages other relationships, and that's the kind of accusation you get. I think everyone who is in this life has that experience. Those who asked me were more distant relatives and friends who wanted to meet me and I didn't have time. ... I realised that it was difficult to maintain certain relationships and at the same time work as I wanted. This is difficult.\nGomide gave up research when she became head of mathematics but she did other work such as making translations. For example, she translated\nCarl Boyer\n's book\nA History of Mathematics\ninto Portuguese and it was published in\n1974\n. In an interview in the year\n2000\nshe explained how her ideas on teaching had changed\n[\n12\n]\n:-\nI now have other ideas about the best way to go about things. I was part of a tradition - which I thought was very good - of the Analysis of the Italian school. Now I like to think more about applications, about history. ... Not that I think it's essential to tell a story, it's not that much that is required. It's nice for us to tell a little about the history of the subject, but now that I know a little more about the history of mathematics, it serves as an instrument for reflection. You can see what is the best way to open up the subject to students by thinking about the way things developed. So today I would follow other paths, but I don't think the other ways were wrong.\nGomide's influence on Brazilian mathematics was substantial. She was a founding member of the SÃ£o Paulo Mathematical Society, of the\nBrazilian Mathematical Society\nand of the Brazilian Centre for Physics Research. She supervised many master's and doctoral theses and always enthusiastically devoted herself to teaching activities, which she considered her most important role. She became very involved when the Ministry of Education decided to impose the Licentiate in Science, which she thought would be extremely harmful, especially to mathematics. She participated in the Forum of Licentiates, organised by the University of SÃ£o Paulo in\n1990\n. She presented a proposal for a curriculum structure for the Licentiate in Mathematics course which, after being approved by the Forum, was implemented in\n1994\n.\nGomide worked at the University of SÃ£o Paulo from\n1945\nuntil her mandatory retirement in\n1995\n. Even after her retirement, she continued to contribute to the University of SÃ£o Paulo, participating in thesis boards and teaching, as long as her health allowed her to do so. She died aged\n88\n.",
