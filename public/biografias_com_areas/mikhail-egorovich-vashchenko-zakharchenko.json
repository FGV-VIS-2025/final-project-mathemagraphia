  "biografia": "Mikhail Egorovich Vashchenko-Zakharchenko\nwas born in Ukraine at a time when it was partitioned with most of its territory being a part of the Russian Empire from the\n1790\ns. He attended Kiev University which was still quite a new institution having been founded in\n1834\n. Kiev, and particularly the University, were at this time a major focus of Ukrainian nationalism, although severe persecution from the tsarist government meant that it could not show itself openly. Following his studies in Kiev, Vashchenko-Zakharchenko went to France where he studied mathematics at the Sorbonne and then he spent the academic year\n1847\n-\n48\nstudying at the CollÃ¨ge de France. After returning from France, Vashchenko-Zakharchenko continued his studies at Kazan University in the Russian city of Kazan about\n600\nkm east of Moscow. This university, which had been founded in\n1804\n, had flourished during the years\n1827\n-\n46\nduring which\nNikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky\nhad served as rector. As well as overseeing a major building programme,\nLobachevsky\nhad done much to raise the level of teaching and research in the institution. Vashchenko-Zakharchenko entered the university soon after these major improvements had taken place and obtained his candidate's degree in\n1854\n.\nAfter his studies in Kazan, he returned to Kiev and he taught at Kiev Cadet School from\n1855\nto\n1862\n, receiving his Master's Degree in\n1862\nfor a dissertation on the operational method and its application to solving linear\ndifferential equations\n. After receiving his Master's Degree, Vashchenko-Zakharchenko was appointed to the University of Kiev as a\nPrivatdozent\nin\n1863\n. He remained there for the rest of his life, being promoted to extraordinary professor in\n1867\nand to ordinary professor in the following year. He retired from teaching in\n1902\n.\nVashchenko-Zakharchenko made contributions to several areas of mathematics. In particular he worked on the theory of linear differential equations, the\ntheory of probability\n(\nsee\n[\n3\n]\n)\nand\nnon-euclidean geometry\n. He exerted great influence on a number of other mathematicians who joined him at Kiev, and his research interests strongly influenced others who taught there, particularly\nBoris Bukreev\nwho was appointed as professor of mathematics at Kiev in\n1889\n.\nWith wide ranging interests, it was natural for Vashchenko-Zakharchenko to write on a variety of topics and, indeed, his twelve textbooks cover many different topics. He published\nThe Symbolic Calculus and its Application to the Integration of Linear Differential Equations\nin\n1862\n. This book contained an extremely extensive development of the operational method. His book\nRiemann's theory of functions of a complex variable\n(1866)\nbrought the Russian reader into contact with the most advanced ideas of the theory of functions at the time. Another important book was\nThe theory of determinants and the theory of forms\n(1877)\n. Taranovskaya looks at this work in\n[\n4\n]\nin the context of the development of the theory of\ndeterminants\nand the spreading of these ideas in Russia. We also mention Vashchenko-Zakharchenko's\nAnalytic geometry\nwhich he published in\n1887\n.\nZiwet, writing in\n1884\n, four years after the publication of Vashchenko-Zakharchenko's\nThe Elements of Euclid, with an explanatory introduction and annotations\n(1880)\n, explains:-\nBesides numerous and extensive notes, and additions to the text, designed to render\nEuclid\n's treatment of geometry more palatable to modern taste, and to fill up some lacunae in the old work, the author has prefixed to his translation a valuable dissertation on the axioms and postulates and on the so-called non-Euclidean geometry of\nBolyai\nand\nLobachevsky\n, of which a sufficiently full sketch is presented. That a man so well acquainted with modern investigations of the principles of the science of space as Mr Vashchenko-Zakharchenko\n(\na bibliography of this subject is also appended to the volume\n)\nshould prove such an ardent adherent of\nEuclid\n, pure and simple, for the schools, is a truly remarkable fact.\nThe article by Ziwet makes some interesting deductions from the data given in Vashchenko-Zakharchenko's\nEuclid\nwhere he lists\n455\npublished editions of\nEuclid\n's\nElements\n. What Vashchenko-Zakharchenko's list of editions shows is that by the middle of the\n19\nth\ncentury\nEuclid\n's\nElements\nwas used as a textbook in Britain but in no other country in the world. In fact I\n[\nEFR\n]\ncan confirm that\n100\nyears later, in the\n1950\ns,\nEuclid\nwas still being used as a textbook in Britain for I was taught geometry from\nEuclid\nat secondary school. The difference between Britain and other European countries is marked in this respect. For example, the last edition of\nEuclid\n's\nElements\nlisted by Vashchenko-Zakharchenko as published in France appeared in\n1778\n.\nVashchenko-Zakharchenko also wrote an important work on the history of mathematics in\n1883\nin which he discussed the history of mathematics up to the\n15\nth\ncentury. The authors of\n[\n1\n]\nwrite:-\nIn\n1880\nVashchenko-Zakharchenko professor of mathematics at the University of Kiev, and an active advocate of teaching geometry in\nGymnasium\naccording to\nEuclid\n, translated\nEuclid\n's 'Elements' into Russian with historical commentary. Three years later he published the first volume of 'History of Mathematics' which was devoted mainly to geometry from antiquity to the Renaissance. Despite the fact that Vashchenko-Zakharchenko's translation of\nEuclid\nwas free and sometimes inaccurate, and that his 'History of Mathematics: Historical treatise on the development of geometry, Volume\n1\n' was little more than a compilation of the works of Western European authors, especially\nMoritz Cantor\n, both work were of considerable importance. They marked the beginning of the history of mathematics in Russia as a discipline, and not simply as a field of sporadic research. In Russia\n(\nand later in the USSR\n)\n, the history of mathematics was developed mainly by mathematicians and so was regarded as a mathematical discipline. This perception has persisted to the present ...\nVashchenko-Zakharchenko wrote on other historical topics too; for example he wrote a history of the development of analytic geometry.",
