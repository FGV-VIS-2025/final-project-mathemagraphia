  "biografia": "Claude-Louis Mathieu\nwas born in MÃ¢con, the capital of SaÃ´ne-et-Loire in the Bourgogne region of east-central France, to the north of Lyon. MÃ¢con was an episcopal see at the time of his birth, but this ended in\n1790\n. In\n1799\n, when Claude was sixteen years old, he saw the former Cathedral of Saint-Vincent being demolished. His father had wanted him to become a carpenter but while he attended the free school in MÃ¢con he developed a liking for mathematics. After leaving the school he continued his studies on his own, helped only by the elderly priest AbbÃ© Sigorne. Having heard about exciting educational developments in Paris where the Ãcole Polytechnique, a state supported institution of higher education and research, had been founded by\nLazare Carnot\nand\nGaspard Monge\nin\n1794\n, he went to Paris in\n1801\nto try to gain admission to the Ãcole. His family were poor and he had practically no money to support himself, but he was able to find a room to live in under\nJean Baptiste Delambre\n's observatory. He took a course at the Ãcole Centrale des Quatre Nations to prepare for entry to the Ãcole Polytechnique and began his studies there in the autumn of\n1803\n, entering at the same time as\nFranÃ§ois Arago\n.\nMathieu and\nArago\nquickly became friends\n(\nMathieu later become\nArago\n's brother-in-law when he married his sister in\n1821)\n. Mathieu graduated in\n1805\nand became a student engineer of Ponts et ChaussÃ©es.\nArago\n, however, had been appointed as secretary of the Paris Observatory in\n1804\n. Later he was sent with\nJean-Baptiste Biot\nto continue the measurements of the arc of the meridian which had been carried out by\nDelambre\nand\nPierre MÃ©chain\nuntil the death of the latter. After\nArago\nand\nBiot\nleft Paris in\n1806\nto begin their measurements in Spain, Mathieu was appointed as secretary of the Paris Observatory to replace\nArago\n. In the following year he was promoted to assist\nDelambre\nwho was the director of the Observatory.\nIn\n1808\nMathieu, together with the astronomers\nAlexis Bouvard\nand\nJean Burckhardt\n, worked on reducing the data obtained by\nArago\nand\nBiot\nin their extension of the meridian measurements to the Balearic Islands. In the same year, together with\nBiot\n, he embarked on a series of measurements of the length of the seconds pendulum at different points on the meridian, in particular at Bordeaux and at Dunkirk. Both Mathieu and\nBiot\nreceived a prize from the\nAcademy of Sciences\nin\n1809\nfor this highly accurate work, and in\n1812\nthey received a second prize from the Academy for their achievements. Between August\n1812\nand November\n1813\n, Mathieu and\nArago\ncarried out numerous observations on the star\n61\nCygni, attempting to measure its parallax. This star was thought\n(\ncorrectly\n)\nto be relatively close since\nGiuseppe Piazzi\nhad shown in\n1804\nthat it had a large proper motion, a fact which had been brought to the attention of all astronomers by\nWilhelm Bessel\nin\n1812\n. Mathieu and\nArago\narrived at the correct conclusion that the parallax of this star was less than half a second, but the actual determination of its parallax had to wait until\n1838\nwhen\nBessel\ncomputed it.\nCharles Messier, the comet hunter who produced his famous catalogue of extended sky objects, died on\n12\nApril\n1817\nand so a place in the Astronomy Section of the\nAcademy of Sciences\nbecame vacant. Mathieu was elected to fill this vacant place later that year. In the same year he was appointed deputy at the Bureau des Longitudes. In addition in\n1817\n, he was appointed as rÃ©pÃ©titeur by\nArago\nfor his course on Geodesy at the Ãcole Polytechnique, and by\nDelambre\nfor his course on Astronomy at the CollÃ¨ge de France.\nAs we mentioned above, Mathieu married the younger of\nArago\n's two sisters in\n1821\n; their daughter married the astronomer Auguste-Ernest Paul Laugier. Mathieu was appointed professor of analysis at the Ãcole Polytechnique in\n1828\n, a position he held for ten years when he resigned to take up an appointment as an examiner for students completing their courses at the Ãcole. For many years Claude Mathieu's work for the Bureau des Longitudes involved editing the work on population statistics\nL'Annuaire du Bureau des Longitudes\n.\nIn\n1821\n, the year Mathieu married,\nDelambre\nwas making careful preparations for his own death. He was himself a historian so knew the right way to go about ensuring that his biography would be presented in the way he wanted. He destroyed most of his personal papers and wrote a short autobiography. This was used by Mathieu as the basis for the biography of\nDelambre\nthat he wrote and published in\nBiographie universelle\nâ\n(\nUniversal Biography\n)\n.\nDelambre\nhad published five volumes of his history of astronomy but left the sixth volume\nL'Histoire de l'astronomie au XVIII siÃ¨cle\nâ\n(\nHistory of astronomy in the eighteenth century\n)\nunpublished. He only included astronomers who were deceased and as he wanted himself included in the volume it had to wait until he died. Mathieu, who had been left as\nDelambre\n's scientific executor, completed the work and it was published in\n1827\n.\nAlso unpublished was\nDelambre\n's\nThe size and shape of the earth\n. In this he discussed in detail the fact that\nMÃ©chain\nhad deliberately falsified the data when measuring the meridian and this made Mathieu decide not to publish the work as he felt it might damage the case he was making for having the metric system reinstated. The metric system had become obligatory throughout France in September\n1801\nbut had been rescinded by Napoleon in\n1812\n. Mathieu was one of the two enthusiasts who did most to have the legislation to revive the metric system brought in, the other being Charles-Ãmile Laplace, the son of\nPierre-Simon Laplace\n. By\n1837\nMathieu was a representative for MÃ¢con in the House of Deputies. In fact he was elected as a radical deputy for MÃ¢con\n(1835\n-\n37\n, and\n1838\n-\n48)\n, taking a position on the extreme left of the chamber. He argued that the metric system would make France a modern, prosperous nation in the years to come, and it could be implemented at once because of France's glorious past achievements. He argued that people's rejection of the system had been based on a misunderstanding, and also argued that measuring the meridian had been a great achievement of the French Revolution. The fact that the project had been so major and unrepeatable was its great virtue, argued Mathieu, for the metre was now fixed for all time and even if the Archive Metre were damaged, its length was known in relation to the pendulum so could be reconstructed. The legislation gained widespread support in the House of Deputies in\n1837\n, and as a result of their decisions the metric system became obligatory in France and its colonies from\n1\nJanuary\n1840\n. There was much resistance from the French people, however, and the old measures were still used in some parts of France into the\n20\nth\ncentury.\nOn\n16\nNovember\n1869\n, the French government sent invitations to many countries to participate in an International Metre Commission. This was established in\n1870\nin Paris, meeting at the Conservatoire National des Arts et MÃ©tiers from\n8\nto\n13\nAugust\n1870\n. Claude Mathieu was elected as the president of the Commission. After technical issues were examined by a committee which met from\n2\nto\n14\nApril\n1872\n, the Commission resumed for a second session from\n24\nSeptember to\n12\nOctober\n1872\n. The decision was to accept the Archive Metre as the definition of the metre without reference to the quadrant of the earth. The Commission had\n30\nprototype metres made using the Archive Metre as the reference. It is remarkable that Mathieu was able to undertake the work of president of this Commission despite being\n90\nyears old.\nLapparent writes of Mathieu's final years in\n[\n3\n]\n:-\nThose attending the\nAcademy of Sciences\nin late\n1874\nwere certain to see, every Monday, an old man more than ninety years old, the most senior member of the Company to which he had belonged for far more than half a century, who regularly attended meetings where he showed no sign of fatigue. A representative of another age, he had known intimately\nDelambre\n, and he was the brother-in-law of\nArago\n. If his scientific work lacked the brilliance that had surrounded these great names, we do not honour him less giving unanimous respect to this modest and conscientious worker, concerned his whole life to make himself useful, while being an ardent patriot, always true to his beliefs as convictions of his youth.\nM. Fremy, the president of the Academy, said on his death that\n[\n3\n]\n:-\n...\n[\nMathieu\n]\nmanaged to combine the independence and strength of the honest man with the kindness, the simplicity and the modesty of a scientist.",
