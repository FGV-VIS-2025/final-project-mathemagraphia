  "biografia": "Terry Wall\n's father Charles Wall was a schoolteacher. Terry Wall attended Marlborough College. He then entered Trinity College, Cambridge from where he was awarded a B.A. and, in\n1960\n, a Ph.D. for his thesis\nAlgebraic Aspects of Cobordism\n. His thesis advisors at Cambridge were\nChris Zeeman\nand\nFrank Adams\n. On\n22\nAugust\n1959\nhe married Alexandra Joy\n(\nSandra\n)\nHearnshaw; they had four children, Nicholas\n(\nborn\n1962)\n, Catherine\n(\nborn\n1963)\n, Lucy\n(\nborn\n1965)\n, and Alexander\n(\nborn\n1967)\n.\nWall had already been awarded a fellowship at Trinity College in\n1959\nbefore the award of his doctorate and he held this fellowship until\n1964\n. He did not remain in Cambridge for all of this period, for instance he was awarded a Harkness Fellowship which allowed him to spend the academic year\n1960\n-\n61\nat the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton. In addition to his fellowship, Wall was appointed a College Lecturer at Cambridge when he returned from the United States in\n1961\n.\nIn\n1964\nWall moved from Cambridge to Oxford where he was appointed Reader in Mathematics and a fellow of St Catherine's College. After a year he was appointed to the chair of Pure Mathematics at the University of Liverpool, taking up the professorship in Liverpool in\n1965\n. During\n1967\nhe was a\nRoyal Society\nLeverhulme visiting professor in Mexico. A SERC senior research fellowship from\n1983\nto\n1988\nenabled him to concentrate on research over this period.\nWall's research is mostly in the area of geometric\ntopology\nand related algebra. In particular he has made substantial contributions to the study of singularities, especially isolated singularities, of differentiable maps and algebraic varieties. He has written a number of highly influential books including\nSurgery on compact\nmanifolds\n(1970)\nand\nA geometric introduction to topology\n(1972)\n. This latter work is an introduction to\nalgebraic topology\nfor a reader without background in\ngeneral topology\n. The book builds up to a proof of the\nAlexander\nduality theorem in the plane; a result which generalises the\nJordan\ncurve theorem.\nIn\n1995\nWall published\nThe geometry of topological stability\nwritten jointly with A A du Plessis. His current research continues the studies of applications of techniques developed in this book which is having spin-offs to results about hypersurfaces in projective space. To date he has published over\n160\nresearch articles on mathematical topics.\nWall's work has led to him receiving many awards. He was elected a fellow of the\nRoyal Society\nin\n1969\nand the\nRoyal Society\nhas honoured him further with the award of its\nSylvester\nMedal in\n1988\n. He was a member of the Council of the\nRoyal Society\nfrom\n1974\nto\n1976\n.\nHe has served the\nLondon Mathematical Society\nin many ways over a large number of years being on the Council from\n1972\nto\n1980\nand then for a second spell from\n1992\nto\n1996\n. He served as the\n59\nth\nPresident of the\nLondon Mathematical Society\nfrom\n1978\n-\n80\n. The Society has made him a number of awards to mark his fine mathematical achievements, including the award of their Junior Berwick Prize, their\nWhitehead\nPrize in\n1976\nand their\nPÃ³lya\nPrize in\n1988\n. The\nWhitehead\nPrize and the\nPÃ³lya\nPrize were awarded for his work on surgery on manifolds and\nL\nL\nL\n-theory. In\n1990\nWall was elected a foreign member of the\nRoyal Danish Academy of Sciences\n.\nIn\n2000\nhe was elected an honorary member of the\nIrish Mathematical Society\n.\nWall retired in\n1999\nand was made Emeritus Professor at the University of Liverpool. At the same time he was appointed Senior Fellow at the University of Liverpool, a position he held until\n2003\n. Retirement certainly did not mean that Wall was less in demand as a plenary speaker at international conferences. He was a main speaker at the conference 'Singularity theory' held in Sao Carlos, Brazil in\n1994\nand was then asked again to be a main speaker at this 'Singularity theory' conference in\n2000\n,\n2002\n,\n2006\n, and\n2008\n. He was also a main speaker at the 'Singularity theory' conference held in Sapporo, Japan in\n2003\n. Wall continues to publish important research articles, and an outstanding book\nSingular points of plane curves\nin\n2004\n. CÃ­cero Fernandes de Carvalho writes in a review:-\nAlthough important results about singularities of algebraic curves may be traced back to\nNewton\n, this field's more steady development only gained momentum in the late nineteenth century, with the results of\nMax Noether\non the resolution of singularities. A short time after that, another important contribution appeared in the work of Karl Brauner on the fundamental group of the complement of a link in the\n3\n-sphere, in the beginning of the twentieth century. From then on, a growing interplay between the fields of topology and algebra contributed to a deeper understanding of singularities. This interaction, and many of its results, are fully exposed and explained in the book under review. ... In this reviewer's belief this is an excellent textbook for a graduate course on singularities of plane curves, and certainly is another most valuable contribution from the author.\nOutside mathematics Wall has many interests including home wine making, reading, gardening, walking and an interest in politics which has seen him as treasurer of the Wirral Area SDP from\n1985\nto\n1988\n. He then became a member of the Wirral West Liberal Democrat Party. From\n1987\nhe has been a Governor of West Kirby Grammar School for girls, and from\n2000\nhe has been Treasurer of Hoylake Chamber Concert Society.",
