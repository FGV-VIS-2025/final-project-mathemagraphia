  "biografia": "StanisÅaw Ruziewicz\nwas the son of Franciszek Ruziewicz and his wife Teresa JasiÅska. Franciszek Ruziewicz, born in BolechÃ³w, Galicia, in\n1853\n, was a craftsman and builder. StanisÅaw began his primary school education in\n1896\nand, when he reached the age of eleven in\n1990\n, he began his Gymnasium studies at the\n1\nst Gymnasium in KoÅomyja. He quickly showed that he was extremely talented so after a year he transferred to the\n3\nrd Gymnasium in LwÃ³w since this provided a higher quality of education. He attended the\n3\nrd Gymnasium in LwÃ³w from\n1901\nto\n1904\nbut his father died when only\n50\nyears old leaving the family in severe financial difficulties. The only way that StanisÅaw could complete his secondary schooling was to return to the\n1\nst Gymnasium in KoÅomyja and to earn money by giving private lessons. Back in KoÅomyja he spent\n1904\n-\n1908\nat the Gymnasium and obtained his secondary school certificate with distinction in\n1908\n.\nGiven the financial position of his family, attending university was always going to be hard for Ruziewicz but he was prepared to earn money giving private lessons and live as cheaply as possible. He entered the Faculty of Philosophy of the University of LwÃ³w in the autumn of\n1908\nwhere he specialised in mathematics. At the University of LwÃ³w, Ruziewicz attended lectures by the professors\nJÃ³zef Puzyna\nand\nWacÅaw SierpiÅski\n. At this time\nSierpiÅski\nwas keen to build up a strong mathematics school in LwÃ³w and he quickly saw that Ruziewicz was talented and encouraged him greatly. Ruziewicz worked towards a doctorate advised by\nPuzyna\nand in\n1912\npublished his first paper, namely\nO pewnym zagadnieniu dotyczÄcym funkcji przemiennych\nâ\n(\nOn a problem concerning commutative functions\n)\n. The paper begins as follows:-\nIn the article \"Principles of Iterative Calculus\"\n(1912)\nMr Å BÃ¶ttcher proves the theorem that two functions, which are iterations of one and the same third function, are commutative, and adds that the question whether the converse of this theorem is also valid remains open.\nI would like to answer this question negatively by giving a very simple example of two continuous, commutative functions which are not iterations of one and the same function.\nOn\n15\nOctober\n1913\nRuziewicz graduated with a doctorate having submitted the thesis\nO  funkcji  ciÄgÅej,  monotonicznej,  nie  posiadajÄcej  pochodnej  w  nieprzeliczalnej  mnogoÅci  punktÃ³w\nâ\n(\nOn a continuous, monotonic function that has no derivative in an uncountable of points\n)\n.\nSierpiÅski\n's aim of building his school of mathematics was going well with\nStefan Mazurkiewicz\nbeing awarded has doctorate from LwÃ³w in February\n1913\nand\nZygmunt Janiszewski\nhabilitated\nat the University of LwÃ³w in\n1913\nhaving spent time abroad. Ruziewicz was also encouraged to study abroad and, with support from\nSierpiÅski\n, was awarded a scholarship by the Academy of Arts in KrakÃ³w which enabled him to go to GÃ¶ttingen. He was thrilled to be in the group of talented mathematician gathered around\nFelix Klein\nand\nDavid Hilbert\n. But he could not be totally confident that he would be able to become a professor back in Poland so, while in GÃ¶ttingen, as well as immersing himself in pure mathematics, he also attended\nFelix Bernstein\n's course on insurance mathematics thinking that this would look good if he had to seek employment in an insurance company.\nWorld War I broke out in July\n1914\nwhen Ruziewicz was enjoying his studies at GÃ¶ttingen and making good progress towards an habilitation thesis. Germany and Austria were part of the Central Powers who opposed the Allies including France, Britain and Russia. Ruziewicz was in Galicia, a part of Poland controlled by Austria. In the early part of the war, Germany attacked France and Russia attacked Galicia. Ruziewicz returned to his homeland and continued to work on his habilitation thesis, but in June\n1915\n, he was conscripted into the Austrian army. In fact LwÃ³w had been captured by the Russians in September\n1914\nbut retaken by the Austrians in June\n1915\n. Ruziewicz was assigned to the\n24\nth Infantry Regiment stationed in DÃ©vavÃ¡nya in Hungary. Never physically strong, he was quickly seen to be of more use to the army in a clerical role and he was sent to LwÃ³w, now back in Austrian hands, to work in the letter censorship office. MaÅgorzata PrzeniosÅo describes in\n[\n9\n]\nhow he suffered continuing illnesses during World War I:-\nDue to severe arthritis, in February\n1916\nhe was taken to the local Red Cross hospital in LwÃ³w. After treatment in May he was transferred to PÃ¶styen\n(\npresent-day Piszczany in Slovakia\n)\n. Due to a recurrence of the disease, he stayed in several more hospitals, and at the end of\n1916\nhe was assigned to the staff of his regiment in Freudenthal\n[\npresent-day Bruntal in the Czech Republic\n]\n. Later, he performed clerical service in nearby JÃ¤gerndorf\n[\npresent-day Krnov in the Czech Republic\n]\n, interrupted by stays in hospitals. In January\n1918\n, he went to Bukovina with a review committee. After returning in February, he was assigned to the writers' reserve in Lobnitz\n[\npresent-day Wapienica, a district of Bielsko-BiaÅa\n]\nand soon temporarily sent back to the letter censorship office in LwÃ³w. He did not return to Lobnitz because of the epidemic of typhus there, and at the end of April he was given leave from the army\n(\nat the rank of sergeant\n)\nuntil the end of the year\n1918\n.\nReleased from the army in April\n1918\n, Ruziewicz was appointed as a mathematics teacher at a Gymnasium in ÅaÅcut. He had actually completed his habilitation thesis\nO funkcyach ciÄgÅych, monotonicznych, posiadajÄcych pantachiczne przedziaÅy staÅoÅci\nâ\n(\nOn continuous, monotonic functions having pantachic intervals of constancy\n)\nbefore being conscripted into the army and it had been published in\n1916\nin\nPracy Matematyczno-Fizyczne\nbut he had not been able to carry out the habilitation process at that time. In July\n1918\n, however, he was able to go to LwÃ³w.\nSierpiÅski\n, who had been in Russia when World War I started, had first been interned in Viatka but then allowed to spend the rest of the war years in Moscow working with\nLuzin\n. By July\n1918\nhe was back in LwÃ³w and, with\nPuzyna\n, he led Ruziewicz's habilitation examination on\n3\nJuly\n1918\n. Ruziewicz was asked six questions and the committee unanimously agreed that he could proceed to give his habilitation lecture on\n6\nJuly. He delivered the lecture on set theory and its role in mathematics and it was unanimously agreed that he could become a\ndocent\nand lecture at the university.\nIn September\n1918\nRuziewicz took up a position as a substitute mathematics teacher at the\n8\nth Gymnasium in LwÃ³w. Now the University of LwÃ³w was going through a difficult time for mathematics since\nWacÅaw SierpiÅski\nand\nZygmunt Janiszewski\nboth left to take up positions in Warsaw while\nJÃ³zef Puzyna\nbecame ill and was unable to lecture. This left\nHugo Steinhaus\n, who was an assistant at the time, as the only mathematics lecturer left in LwÃ³w. World War I ended with an armistice on\n11\nNovember\n1918\nbut German troops still occupied much of Poland. An uprising broke out in Poland with members of the Polish military fighting for an independent Poland. The Battle of LwÃ³w took place from November\n1918\nto May\n1919\nas Polish troops fought for an independent Poland. LwÃ³w was occupied by Ukrainian soldiers in November\n1918\nand fighting was fierce. It is believed that\n76\nstudents from the University of LwÃ³w died in the fighting. Peace was restored in LwÃ³w in May\n1919\nand in the following month the University of LwÃ³w passed a resolution, called Memorial on Eastern Galicia, which demanded the inclusion of Eastern Galicia as part of a new independent Poland. Ruziewicz was one of the signatories of this resolution. The\n1919\n-\n20\nsession began in September\n1919\nwith lectures in Ukrainian being banned and any students who had fought on the Ukrainian side were banned. On\n22\nNovember\n1919\nthe university received the official name of the Jan Kazimierz University.\nThere were now two vacant mathematics chairs at the University and decisions had to be made about filling them. There were two talented mathematicians teaching there, namely Ruziewicz and\nSteinhaus\n, and they were considered as candidates. Ruziewicz, perhaps reasonably, was considered too inexperienced at this time but\nSteinhaus\n, although more experienced, was controversial. He had a Jewish background and the Jews of LwÃ³w had mostly sided with the Ukrainians in the recent Battle of LwÃ³w. Much argument ensued and appointing someone from outside the university was considered but eventually rejected. Ruziewicz and\nSteinhaus\nhad very different personalities and actually presented themselves as very different. Ruziewicz was rather shy while\nSteinhaus\nwas very much the extrovert. On\n1\nAugust\n1920\nSteinhaus\nwas appointed to the\n2\nnd Chair of Mathematics. Ruziewicz was showing that he was rapidly becoming more experienced having published two excellent papers:\nSur les fonctions qui ont la mÃªme dÃ©rivÃ©e et dont la diffÃ©rence n'est pas constante\nâ\n(\nOn functions that have a derivative and no difference is constant\n)\n(1920)\n; and\nO niestosowalnoÅci zasadniczego twierdzenia Rachunku caÅkowego do funkcyj, majÄcych pochodne nieskoÅczone\nâ\n(\nOn the inapplicability of the fundamental theorem of integral calculus to functions having infinite derivatives\n)\n(1920)\n. A new\n3\nrd Chair of Mathematics was established and Ruziewicz was appointed to that chair on\n1\nJanuary\n1921\n. In fact the opposition that\nSteinhaus\nsuffered actually helped Ruziewicz since those wishing to oppose\nSteinhaus\n's appointment, but had no valid argument to prevent his appointment, were happy to create a new chair for Ruziewicz.\nSteinhaus\nwrites in\n[\n13\n]\nabout these years in LwÃ³w:-\nIt was\nJaniszewski\nwho had founded a mathematical society in LwÃ³w, later to become a branch of the\nPolish Mathematical Society\n. Its earliest members were\nJaniszewski\n,\nKrygowski\n,\nÅ»yliÅski\n, Åomnicki,\nBanach\n, Ruziewicz, and I, with DziwiÅski attending quite rarely. Our little mathematical society flourished. It did not take long for\nBanach\nand Ruziewicz to achieve their Habilitation. Although LwÃ³w University was growing scientifically, nonetheless the dominant mood in the town was one of postwar social chaos and bedlam: frenzied dancing and playing games, tripping hither and thither, libertinism with the accompanying temporary liaisons and betrayals - in a word, the release of the steam of freedom that had been bottled up for years, the reward for the wartime years of oppression and greyness. All this was characteristic of the years\n1920\n-\n1923\n.\nSteinhaus\nhad brought\nStefan Banach\nto LwÃ³w in\n1920\n. Although\nBanach\nwas an extraordinarily talented mathematician, his love for mathematics was in proving theorems but he had little interest in writing up his results for publication. He also had little interest in writing letters and when he received letters he seldom replied. Ruziewicz was one of\nBanach\n's colleagues who played an important role in finding ways to publish\nBanach\n's results. Ruziewicz had his assistant make notes when\nBanach\nwas explaining his latest results, then presented\nBanach\nwith a draft of a paper.\nBanach\nwas happy to see his results published and he would correct and improve the paper for publication, happy to find that he did not need to \"waste time\" doing what he considered the boring bits. Similarly, Ruziewicz helped in correspondence with\nSierpiÅski\nwho was the editor of\nFundamenta Mathematicae\nwhere he published his own papers and helped organise publication of\nBanach\n's papers.\nIn July\n1922\n, Ruziewicz married Teofila Zembrzuska. They had one son ZdzisÅaw Ruziewicz\n(1925\n-\n1997)\nwho was born on\n13\nJune\n1925\nin LwÃ³w. ZdzisÅaw went on to study in KrakÃ³w and in WrocÅaw where he was awarded a doctorate in chemistry and later became a professor of Physical Chemistry at the University of Technology.\nRuziewicz continue to play an increasingly important role in the strong mathematical group which were now at the Jan Kazimierz University of LwÃ³w. For example he published\nSur un ensemble non dÃ©nombrable de points, superposable avec les moitiÃ©s de sa partie aliquote\nâ\n(\nOn an uncountable set of points, superimposable with the halves of its aliquot part\n)\nin the second volume of\nFundamenta Mathematicae\nin\n1921\n. The Abstract reads:-\nThe aim of this note is to demonstrate the existence of an uncountable plane set, superimposable with two of its subsets which have no common points.\nIn the same journal he published\nUne application de l'Ã©quation fonctionnelle\nf\n(\nx\n+\ny\n)\n=\nf\n(\nx\n)\n+\nf\n(\ny\n)\nf(x+ y)= f(x) + f(y)\nf\n(\nx\n+\ny\n)\n=\nf\n(\nx\n)\n+\nf\n(\ny\n)\nÃ  la dÃ©composition de la droite en ensembles superposables, non mesurables\nâ\n(\nAn application of the functional equation f\n(\nx+ y\n)\n= f\n(\nx\n)\n+ f\n(\ny\n)\nto the decomposition of the line into superimposable, unmeasurable sets\n)\nin\n1924\n. The Abstract of this paper reads:-\nThe aim of this note is to prove a very simple property of the function\nf\n(\nx\n)\nf(x)\nf\n(\nx\n)\nsatisfying the functional equation:\nf\n(\nx\n+\ny\n)\n=\nf\n(\nx\n)\n+\nf\n(\ny\n)\nf(x + y) = f(x) + f(y)\nf\n(\nx\n+\ny\n)\n=\nf\n(\nx\n)\n+\nf\n(\ny\n)\n, a property which will allow us to decompose the line into  ð superimposable sets, everywhere dense, disjoint, non-measurable\n(\nL\n)\n, ð being any cardinal number, satisfying the inequalities\nâµ\n0\nâ¤\n\\aleph _{0}  â¤\nâµ\n0\nâ\nâ¤\nð\nâ¤\n2\nâµ\n0\nâ¤ 2^{\\aleph _{0}}\nâ¤\n2\nâµ\n0\nâ\n.\nIn the\n1925\nVolume\n7\nof\nFundamenta Mathematicae\nRuziewicz published\nContribution Ã  l'Ã©tude des ensembles de distances de points\nâ\n(\nContribution to the study of sets of distances of points\n)\nwith the Abstract:-\nThe purpose of this note is to answer the following question: Question: What is known about a linear set, such that no point equidistant between any two points of this set does not belong to it?\nHe also published in the journals\nWiadomoÅci Matematyczne\nand\nPrzeglÄd Matematyczno-Fizyczny\nwith papers dealing with set theory, theory of functions of a real variable, and the theory of functional equations.\nRuziewicz's appointment to the\n3\nrd Chair of Mathematics did not make him a full professor and in November\n1923\nhe applied to the Ministry of Education for an appointment as a full professor at the Jan Kazimierz University of LwÃ³w. His application was accepted and his new status took effect from\n1\nMarch\n1924\n.\nThe First Polish Mathematics Congress was held in LwÃ³w\n7\n-\n10\nSeptember\n1927\n. Ruziewicz was a member of the Organising Committee of the Congress, chaired by\nSierpiÅski\n, and he was one of the four chairman of Section C: Set Theory and Functions of a Real Variable. The other three chairmen of Section C were\nBanach\n,\nKuratowski\nand\nSaks\n. Ruziewicz was also put on a committee to set up the Polish Society of Teachers of Mathematics. The Proceedings of the Congress contains the short paper\nOn functions satisfying the generalised Lipschitz condition\nby Ruziewicz which announced results that were to appear in two\n1928\npapers by Ruziewicz, namely\nSur les fonctions satisfaisant Ã  la condition de Lipschitz gÃ©nÃ©ralisÃ©e\nâ\n(\nOn functions satisfying the generalised Lipschitz condition\n)\n(1928)\nand\nUn exemple d'une fonction continue croissante ayant presque partout la dÃ©rivÃ©e nulle\nâ\n(\nAn example of an increasing continuous function having almost everywhere the zero derivative\n)\n(1928)\n.\nAs a teacher, Ruziewicz always delivered carefully prepared lectures but, probably through shyness, did not interact much with his students. His students described him as patient and fair\n[\n9\n]\n:-\nRuziewicz mainly taught classes on introduction to mathematical analysis, theory of analytic functions, differential and integral calculus, differential equations, number theory and set theory.\nMark Kac\nbegan his studies at the University of LwÃ³w in\n1931\nand describes in\n[\n6\n]\nattending a course given by Ruziewicz in his first year:-\nThe proseminar had already been in session for a number of weeks when Professor StanisÅaw Ruziewicz announced the start of his lectures on 'Introduction to Analysis and Differential and Integral Calculus'. I had been especially looking forward to this course because I wanted very badly to learn calculus, after having tried repeatedly and unsuccessfully to learn it by myself. The opening words of the first lecture came as a real shock. \"Gentlemen,\" said the professor, disregarding the female one third of the audience, \"I shall assume that you are familiar with the theory of\nDedekind\ncuts.\" He then proceeded to define the rather subtle concepts of the limit superior and limit inferior of a sequence of real numbers. ... Somehow I was supposed to know this stuff. I came from one of the best schools in Poland and one which emphasised mathematics and science. Yet the most advanced mathematics I had had was a smattering of analytical geometry. ... Ruziewicz himself conducted a once-a-week, two hour problem sessions connected with his course in Analysis I. Usually, problem sessions connected with courses were conducted by assistants but for some reason Analysis I was an exception during my first year. ... Ruziewicz was very shy and he seldom looked at the audience, which may explain his failure to notice women in his classes. He came in and, with hardly a word, wrote a problem on the blackboard and then sat down and waited for someone to volunteer to come to the blackboard and attempt a solution. At first the problems were quite easy and the number of volunteers was sufficient to move things along. But as they became increasingly tougher the number of volunteers dwindled and after a while I was the only one left who had the courage to go to the blackboard. ... A few more words about Ruziewicz. He was a solid, good mathematician and had a number of valuable contributions to his credit. He was not in the class of\nBanach\nor\nSteinhaus\nbut then, few were.\nFrom\n1926\n, Ruziewicz taught at the LwÃ³w Polytechnic as well as at the University.\nEustachy Å»yliÅski\nhad taught at the Jan Kazimierz University from\n1919\nand, in July\n1922\n, became a full professor there. He collaborated with Ruziewicz in writing textbooks and together they published, all in Polish:\nAlgebra: handbook for the higher classes of secondary schools\nPart\n1\n(1926)\n;\nAlgebra: handbook for the higher classes of secondary schools\nPart\n2\n(1926)\n;\nAlgebra: handbook for the higher classes of middle schools\n(1926)\n;\nIntroduction to Mathematics, Elements of Higher Algebra and Number Theory\nI\n(1927)\n; and\nAlgebra: handbook for the higher classes of secondary schools Part\n3\n(1928)\n.\nThe Polish Minister of Education, Janusz JÄdrzejewicz, had convened a committee which advised on changes to the Polish education system. The JÄdrzejewicz reform was approved for schools on\n11\nMarch\n1932\nand, on\n15\nMarch\n1933\n, the reform was extended to higher education. The reform which gave the state the right to close university chairs and to dismiss professors was highly controversial. In an attempt to pacify objections, the reform was amended so that a professor who lost their job because their chair was closed would have full salary for a year during which time they could be transferred to another chair if it became available. This did nothing to make to reform more acceptable and protests continued but were ignored. In total\n52\nchairs at Polish universities were closed by the state,\n13\nat the Jan Kazimierz University of LwÃ³w and\n7\nat the LwÃ³w Polytechnic. In response to being informed on\n1\nSeptember\n1933\nthat Ruziewicz's chair was to close the Council of the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences of the University wrote a strong letter to the Minister supporting Ruziewicz. The\n[\n9\n]\n:-\n... very extensive letter defended not only the chair by emphasising the world class achievements of LwÃ³w mathematics and the losses that such closure would cause, but also StanisÅaw Ruziewicz himself. The Council pointed to his significant scientific and didactic achievements and important character traits of an academic teacher - modesty, diligence, personal culture and fairness towards colleagues and students.\nThe letter was ignored and on\n25\nSeptember\n1933\nRuziewicz's chair was closed. It was claimed that such closures were made for cost-saving reasons but that is hard to believe since someone had to be appointed to do the teaching while the professor continued to receive his salary for a year, and then received a pension. There had for some time been rumours that Ruziewicz held National Democrat beliefs, although there is no evidence that this was true.\nKac\n, who was Jewish, had been aware of the rumours and had been reluctant to ask Ruziewicz for a reference for a fellowship in\n1932\n. Ruziewicz had, however, written\nKac\nan amazingly good reference which got him the fellowship. Certainly Ruziewicz's colleagues believed that the real reason his chair was closed was because of the rumours - we will never know the truth of the rumour.\nAfter Ruziewicz's chair was closed, the Faculty Council continued to give Ruziewicz their strongest support writing many letters to the Minister asking that his chair be reinstated. He was, for a time, allowed to give a few lectures but on\n31\nMay\n1935\nhe was dismissed completely. He was only\n46\nyears old and, with only\n21\nyears of service, did not receive a good pension. From October\n1934\n, he gave commissioned lectures on financial mathematics at the private Higher School of Foreign Trade in LwÃ³w, and in\n1936\nhe was appointed to a regular chair of applied mathematics there. His appointment led to increased prestige for the Higher School of Foreign Trade which changed its name to the LwÃ³w Academy of Foreign Trade. Ruziewicz was elected rector of the Academy in\n1939\n.\nWorld War II began on\n1\nSeptember\n1939\nwhen Germany invaded Poland. Later that month Russian troops invaded Poland and took control of LwÃ³w. The LwÃ³w Academy of Foreign Trade was renamed the Lviv State Institute of Soviet Trade and although Ruziewicz did not retain the position of rector, he was appointed vice-rector with a Russian appointed as rector, and he did retain his chair of applied mathematics. On\n22\nJune\n1941\nGermany broke their non-aggression pact with Moscow and attacked the Soviet Union. On\n30\nJune\n1941\nGerman troops took control of Lviv and on\n3\n-\n4\nJuly they arrested academics at the University and the Polytechnic. Professors working at the Academy of Foreign Trade were not arrested at this time. At about\n5\np.m. on\n11\nJuly, however, a man in civilian clothes, speaking Polish, knocked on the door of Ruziewicz's apartment and announced that he was under arrest. He was led away and never seen again; it is widely believed that he was murdered on the day following his arrest. Ruziewicz's wife and son survived the war but never received any information regarding Ruziewicz's fate.",
