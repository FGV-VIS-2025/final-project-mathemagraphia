  "biografia": "Giuseppe Bagnera\n's father was also named Giuseppe Bagnera and his mother was Dorotea Lucchese. Giuseppe senior and Dorotea were married in Santa Ninfa, Palermo, in Sicily on\n1\nSeptember\n1861\n. However, Giuseppe, the subject of this biography, was orphaned at a young age and grew up in very difficult circumstances having little in the way of financial support. He was born just a few years after Sicily became part of the new Kingdom of Italy in\n1861\n. He studied in Palermo, entering the university to study engineering. He obtained his laurea in civil engineering in\n1890\nbut by this stage he already had two mathematics publications:\nSopra i determinanti che si possono formare con gli stessi elementi\nâ\n(\nOn determinants that can be formed with the same elements\n)\n(1887)\n, and\nSur une propriÃ©tÃ© des sÃ©ries simplement convergentes\nâ\n(\nOn a simple property of convergent series\n)\n(1888)\n. He was taught mathematics by\nGiovanni Battista Guccia\nwho was originally from Palermo, but had studied in Rome before returning to Palermo in\n1880\n.\nGuccia\nset up the\nMathematical Circle of Palermo\nin\n1884\nmaking Palermo an important mathematical centre. This\nMathematical Circle\nwould play an important part in Bagnero's life. At university, Bagnera was also taught by\nErnesto CesÃ ro\nwho lectured in Palermo from\n1887\nto\n1891\n.\nCesÃ ro\nhad spent time in France and may well have influenced Bagnera to publish his\n1888\narticle in French in a French journal.\nFrancesco Gerbaldi\nwas appointed to the chair of analytic and projective geometry at the University of Palermo in\n1890\n. In\n1893\nBagnera, who was now studying mathematics, was appointed as\nGerbaldi\n's assistant. His first contributions to mathematics studied Fuchsian and Kleinian functions and linear systems of algebraic curves\n[\n7\n]\n:-\nBagnera began his scientific work with a series of works marked by the elegant simplicity which was the essential character of all his work.\nIn\n1895\nBagnera was awarded his laurea in mathematics by the University of Palermo and, in the following year, he published two papers\nSul teorema di esistenza delle funzioni fuchsiane\nâ\n(\nOn the existence theorem for Fuchsian functions\n)\n, which further developed ideas which had been introduced by\nHenri PoincarÃ©\n, and\nSul luogo dei contatti tripunti delle curve di un fascio con le curve di una rete\nâ\n(\nOn the place of three point contacts of the curves of a pencil with the curves of a network\n)\n. The second of these papers was published in the journal of the\nMathematical Circle of Palermo\n. It was around this time that he became interested in the theory of finite groups, particularly the study of finite collineation groups. On this new topic, he published\nSopra la costruzione del gruppo dell'icosaedro\nâ\n(\nOn the construction of the icosahedral group\n)\n(1897)\nand a number of papers on group theory in the following year:\nSopra i divisori normali d'indice primo di un gruppo finito\nâ\n(\nAbove normal divisors of first index of a finite group\n)\n;\nUn teorema relativo agli invarianti delle sostituzioni di un gruppo kleiniano\nâ\n(\nA theorem on the invariants of the substitutions of a Kleinian group\n)\n; and\nLa composizione dei gruppi finiti il cui grado Ã¨ la quinta potenza di un numero primo\nâ\n(\nThe composition of finite groups whose degree is the fifth power of a prime number\n)\n. Two important papers by Bagnera contain the list of the groups of order\np\n5\np^{5}\np\n5\n, where\np\np\np\nis a prime.\nHe was named professor at the R Educatorio Maria Adelaide di Palermo in\n1897\n. This school had been built as a nunnery in\n1697\nbut was turned into the Educatorio Carolino boarding school in\n1735\nbefore being renamed the Educatorio Maria Adelaide in\n1860\n. In\n1899\nBagnera was appointed as a teaching assistant in algebraic analysis at the University of Palermo and Gerbaldi encouraged him to compete for chairs. In\n1901\nhe entered the competition for the extraordinary professorship of infinitesimal calculus at the University of Messina and was appointed to the post. He was appointed as an ordinary professor of algebra and analytic geometry at the University of Messina in\n1905\n.\nFrom\n1906\nto\n1909\nBagnera worked in collaboration with\nMichele de Franchis\non the study of irregular surfaces, obtaining fundamental results for the classification of hyperelliptic surfaces. During these years\nMichele de Franchis\n, who was also a Sicilian, was professor of projective and descriptive geometry at the University of Parma, and Bagnera and\nde Franchis\ncollaborated on an outstanding series of papers on the theory of hyperelliptic surfaces. They won the Paris\nAcademy of Sciences\n' Bordin prize in\n1909\nfor their classification of hyperelliptic surfaces. A hyperelliptic surface is an algebraic surface which can be rationally covered by an abelian surface. If not a ruled surface, it is a quotient of an abelian surface by a finite group of automorphisms. There is, however, a rather strange story attached to the\n1909\nBordin prize since the same prize had been awarded in\n1907\nto\nFederigo Enriques\nand\nFrancesco Severi\n, also for classifying hyperelliptic surfaces\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nStrange as it may seem that two couples get two prizes for the same theorem, instead of sharing one, this story is even more complicated, since the first version of the paper by\nEnriques\nand\nSeveri\nwas withdrawn after a conversation of\nSeveri\nwith\nde Franchis\n, and soon corrected. Bagnera and\nde Franchis\nwere only a little later, since they had to admit a restriction; their proof however was simpler ...\nThe remarkable papers Bagnera wrote with\nde Franchis\nover this period are:\nSopra le superficie algebriche che hanno le coordinate del punto generico esprimibili con funzioni meromorfe quadruplamente periodiche di due parametri\nâ\n(\nOn the algebraic surface that have the coordinates of the generic point expressed with meromorphic quadruply periodic functions of two parameters\n)\n(1907)\n;\nSur les surfaces hyperelliptiques\nâ\n(\nOn hyperelliptic surfaces\n)\n(1907)\n;\nLe superficie algebriche le quali ammettono una rappresentazione parametrica mediante funzioni iperellittiche di due argomenti\nâ\n(\nThe algebraic surface which admit a parametric representation using hyperelliptic functions of two arguments\n)\n(1908)\n;\nSopra le funzioni algebriche che si lasciano risolvere con X,Y,Z funzioni quadruplamente periodiche di due parametri\nâ\n(\nOn the algebraic functions that can be solved with X, Y, Z quadruply periodic functions of two parameters\n)\n(1909)\n; and\nIntorno alle superficie regolari di genere zero che ammettono una rappresentazione parametrica mediante funzioni iperellittiche di due argomenti\nâ\n(\nOn the regular neighbouhood of zero generally admitting a parametric representation using hyperelliptic functions of two arguments\n)\n(1909)\n.\nBagnera was extremely fortunate to escape with his life when Sicily was hit with a\n7\n.\n1\nmagnitude earthquake on\n28\nDecember\n1908\n. He was still holding the chair of infinitesimal calculus at the University of Messina at this time but he had travelled to Palermo to spend the Christmas vacation there. On the evening of\n27\nDecember, he went to the railway station in Palermo to catch a train back to Messina but he was late and missed the train. Therefore, he had to spend the night of\n27\n/\n28\nDecember in Palermo waiting to catch a train the next morning. However, at\n5\n.\n20\nin the morning of\n28\nth\n, the earthquake struck, its epicentre being very close to Messina. Shortly after the earthquake, Messina was struck by a tsunami. The devastation produced by the earthquake and the tsunami was horrific with\n91\n% of buildings in the city being destroyed and\n70\n,\n000\nof the inhabitants being killed. Palermo was\n200\nkm from the epicentre of the earthquake and suffered very much less damage. In fact many of those who survived the Messina destruction, fled to Palermo in the days following the natural disaster. Most of the buildings of the University of Messina had been destroyed in the earthquake, including their famous library building. The university was not able to reopen properly until\n1914\nalthough the law school did manage to reopen in\n1909\n. Bagnera had no home and no job to return to in Messina.\nIn\n1909\n, already living in Palermo, he was appointed to the chair of infinitesimal and higher analysis at the University there. Later he served as dean of the faculty of sciences at the university. He also taught financial mathematics at the Higher Institute of Commerce in Palermo and served as director of that Institute. Among his pupils at Palermo we should mention\nMichele Cipolla\nand\nPia Nalli\n. On\n14\nApril\n1914\nthe thirtieth anniversary of the founding of the\nMathematical Circle of Palermo\nwas celebrated at the University of Palermo. Bagnera was one of the members of the organising committee of this international event. A gold medal was presented to\nGiovanni Battista Guccia\nwho founded both the\nMathematical Circle of Palermo\nand its journal the\nRendiconti\n. Bagnera was appointed to the chair of infinitesimal and higher analysis at the University of Rome in\n1921\n, taking up the appointment at the beginning of the following year.\nAfter the\n1908\nearthquake, Bagnera published little in the way of research papers but did publish his lecture notes\n(\nsome in lithographed form\n)\n. These are:\nLezioni di calcolo delle variazioni\nâ\n(\nLessons on the calculus of variations\n)\n(1913)\n,\nLezioni di matematica finanziaria\nâ\n(\nLessons on financial mathematics\n)\n(1914)\n,\nLezioni di calcolo bancario e commerciale\nâ\n(\nLessons on banking and commercial calculation\n)\n(1914)\n,\nCorso di Analisi Infinitesimale\nâ\n(\nCourse of Infinitesimal Analysis\n)\n(1915)\n,\nTeoria dei numeri reali\nâ\n(\nTheory of real numbers\n)\n(1919)\n,\nLezioni di calcolo infinitesimale per gli allievi ingegneri\nâ\n(\nInfinitesimal calculus lessons for engineering students\n)\n(1924)\n,\nLezioni di analisi algebrica\nâ\n(\nLessons on algebraic analysis\n)\n(1926)\n,\nElementi di algebra\nâ\n(\nIntroduction to algebra\n)\n(1926)\n, and\nLezioni sulla teoria delle funzioni analitiche\nâ\n(\nLectures on the theory of analytic functions\n)\n(1927)\n. These are quality works written by an excellent lecturer who polished his material to the highest possible standards\n[\n7\n]\n:-\nBagnera's higher level courses were characterized by having great clarity and the highest scientific rigour.\nIn addition to the Bordin prize awarded by the Paris\nAcadÃ©mie des Sciences\n, which we mentioned above, Bagnera was honoured with election to the\nAccademia Nazionale dei Lincei\n(\nwhich awarded him their mathematical sciences prize in\n1901)\n. In addition, he was elected to the Accademia di scienze, lettere e belle arti of Palermo, the Accademia Peloritana of Messina, the\nNational Academy of Sciences of Italy\n(\nthe \"Academy of Forty\"\n)\n, and the SocietÃ  italiana per il progresso delle scienze. He was a member and served on the board of directors of the\nMathematical Circle of Palermo\n. He was made an honorary professor of the University of Washington. We should also mention that he is remembered with the via Giuseppe Bagnera in his home town of Bagheria and the Scuole Primarie e Secondarie, Scuola Media Statale Bagnera, on the via Giuseppe Bagnera in Rome. The Associazione Culturale \"Giuseppe Bagnera\", based in Bagheria, is named after Giuseppe Bagnera. The Honorary President of the Association is the engineer Giuseppe Bagnera, who is the grandson of the subject of this biography.",
