  "biografia": "Carlos Graef FernÃ¡ndez\nwas the son of Carlos Francisco Graef Ziehl\n(1878\n-\n1945)\nand Gudelia FernÃ¡ndez Espinosa\n(1882\n-\n1953)\n. Carlos Francisco Graef, born in Mexico City on\n17\nSeptember\n1878\n, became a mining engineer in GuanacevÃ­, Mexico. He married Gudelia FernÃ¡ndez in Mexico City on\n25\nMarch\n1910\n. She had been born on\n23\nFebruary\n1882\nin Pachuca, Mexico. Carlos Federico Graef, the subject of this biography, was the eldest of his parents four children having as siblings Hermann Graef FernÃ¡ndez\n(\nborn\n1913\nand became a distinguished doctor\n)\n, Federico Graef FernÃ¡ndez\n(\nborn\n1914\nand died at the age of two\n)\n, and Laura Graef FernÃ¡ndez\n(\nborn\n1916)\n.\nCarlos spent his childhood and adolescence in Mexico City. Both his primary and secondary studies were at the Colegio AlemÃ¡n de MÃ©xico, also known as the Deutsche Oberrealschule zu Mexico. This school, founded in\n1894\non Canoa Street in Mexico City, was the first German school in Mexico. In\n1918\n, the number of pupils having risen greatly, a new building was built. In November of that year, the German-type exam called the\nAbitur\ntook place for the first time on the American continent. Graef completed his primary studies at the school in\n1922\nand continued with his secondary studies. In December\n1928\n, he was awarded the \"Abitur\".\nWith German schooling, Graef decided that he was going to Germany for his university studies. He studied in the department of Civil Engineering of the Technische Hochschule in Darmstadt, Germany, for three terms from\n1929\nto\n1930\n. It was unfortunate timing since the Wall Street Crash of October\n1929\nled to a collapse in the German economy. Conditions in the country rapidly deteriorated and, with his father struggling to fund his studies, Graef decided that he had to return to Mexico to continue his university studies. On\n16\nSeptember\n1930\nhe departed from Hamburg on the ship the Rio Panuco bound for the port of Veracruz in Mexico. Back in Mexico City, he enrolled in the National School of Engineering of the National Autonomous University of Mexico in\n1931\n. He attended courses in the Departments of Oil Engineering, Mathematics and Physics from\n1931\nto\n1933\n. One of his lecturers was\nSotero Prieto\n, but sadly he died in\n1935\nwhile Graef was still a student.\nIn\n1934\nthe rector of the National Autonomous University of Mexico, Manuel GÃ³mez MorÃ­n, restructured the University and created the Faculty of Physical Sciences and Mathematics that included the School of Engineering, the School of Chemical Sciences and a Department of Physics and Mathematics. Graef enrolled in the Department of Physics and Mathematics which, he writes in\n[\n19\n]\n:-\n... was located in the Palacio de MinerÃ­a, home to the School of Engineers. The neighbourhood in the space of the two establishments was very fruitful. The professors in the Physics and Mathematics department were professors from the School of Engineering who had a special love for exact sciences. Those who were then dedicated to teaching these subjects had to give many hours of class every day to be able to collect a decent remuneration. There was no physics or mathematics institute, and the only income for them was from their teaching work.\nAn important event in Graef's mathematical development was attending lectures by\nDirk Jan Struik\n. In the interview\n[\n29\n]\nStruik said:-\nIn the\n1930\ns, I had a pupil by the name of\nAlphonso Napoles\n. He was very good in tensor calculus, and overall. Then he went to Mexico and soon became an outstanding member of the mathematics faculty at the Autonomous University in Mexico City. He became head of the department. Then he invited me to come to Mexico, which I did in\n1934\n, at the time that I had a sabbatical. Included in the invitation was also an invitation by Manuel Sandoval Vallarta, who had returned to Mexico and became a very big shot in the scientific side of the government. I was in Mexico for six weeks in\n1934\n, which was one of the great experiences of my life. The absolute differences between the Spanish and Indian cultures of Mexico and the Northern European culture of the United States was for me overwhelming. So I never forgot the deep impression I got of Mexico in those days. I was received very friendly. I was one of the very first outside lecturers in Mexico, and my pupils and colleagues showed me around. They showed me the pyramids and all kinds of things, and the colonial monuments and the nature. It was a very grand time. I'll never forget it.\nAlthough Graef was still a student, he began teaching in\n1933\nwhen he was appointed professor of Analytic Geometry and Calculus in the Escuela Superior de Construccion of the Secretaria de EducaciÃ³n PÃºblica of the Mexican Government. In\n1934\nhe was appointed Professor of Higher Geometry in the Department of Mathematics and Physics of the Universidad Nacional de MÃ©xico. When teaching in the Preparatory School of the National University,\nManuela GarÃ­n\nwas one of his pupils. She said\n[\n34\n]\n:-\nGraef and\nNÃ¡poles GÃ¡ndara\nwere my mathematics teachers. With such teachers my vocation was further defined. Graef was a nice man, a very good teacher and a man of great human qualities. His laughter in the first yard could be heard as far as the third yard of the Preparatory School. ... Graef was our geometry teacher ...\nIn June\n1937\nGraef was awarded a John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation fellowship to fund his research in mathematics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for a Ph.D. The Foundation's Report of\n1937\n-\n38\nstates that Graef was a Latin American Exchange Fellow\n[\n6\n]\n:-\nAppointed for studies of the theory of probability and mathematical theory of statistics; tenure, twelve months from September\n17\n,\n1938\n.\nOn\n18\nMay\n1938\n, Graef married Alicia SÃ¡nchez Castell in Mexico City. Alicia had been born on\n2\nMarch\n1916\nin Mexico City. Carlos and Alicia Graef had three children: Carlos Graef SÃ¡nchez, Alicia Graef SÃ¡nchez and Carolina Graef SÃ¡nchez. Alicia became a doctor of nuclear medicine, a branch of medical sciences that consists of the application of radioisotopes for the diagnosis and treatment of various diseases; Carolina became a prominent lawyer; and Carlos became an engineer.\nGraef and his wife arrived in Laredo, Texas, USA, on\n26\nJuly\n1938\ntravelling to Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts. In Boston they were lodgers with Estehr Durman at\n707\nCommonwealth Avenue. In\n[\n11\n]\nGraef explains that the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation fellowship:-\n... was in effect until February,\n1940\n, and in March of the same year the President of Mexico, General LÃ¡zaro CÃ¡rdenas, awarded me a stipend to finish my doctoral studies. I received a stipend from the Universidad Nacional de MÃ©xico during all my residence in the United States, as well as scholarships from Massachusetts Institute of Technology for three terms.\nHe undertook research in the Department of Physics, advised by Manuel Sandoval Vallarta and was awarded a Ph.D. in\n1940\nfor his thesis\nAn analysis of periodic orbits of particles of primary cosmic radiation\n. Graef writes in the Abstract\n[\n17\n]\n:-\nThis thesis deals with the orbits traced by a charged particle moving in the magnetic field of a dipole, on a rotating meridian plane following the particle.\n...\nWe use the geometrical method of attack to find properties of the orbits. The transformation of the dynamical problem into a geometrical one is done by the introduction of the characteristic surface, i.e. the surface whose geodesics have the same differential equation as the trajectories. The passing from the dynamical equations of motion to the geometrical equation of the geodesics is essentially an elimination of the time. The meridian plane is a conformal image of the characteristic surface, so that properties of the geodesics on the latter can be translated into properties of orbits on the former.\nWe found that the characteristic surface has singular points which correspond to the boundary between allowed and forbidden regions in the meridian plane. The curvature of the surface is proved to be everywhere positive.\nAlberto Barajas\nwrites\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nThis work, in the opinion of the famous topologist\nSolomon Lefschetz\n, was notable for the very original way of attacking a problem of differential equations in three dimensions, to the best of his knowledge, for the first time. One main result, that all periodic trajectories intersect the magnetic equator, was verified years later when the Van Allen bands, the cosmic ray death belts that surround the Earth, were discovered, so important to astronauts.\nThe thesis was approved in May\n1940\n. By the time he submitted his thesis, he had three papers published:\nRepresentaciÃ³n de un Tensor por medio de Seis Vectores\nâ\n(\nRepresentation of a Tensor by means of Six Vectors\n)\n(1937)\n;\nOn Periodic Orbits in the Equatorial Plane of a Magnetic Dipole\n(1938)\n; and\nGalactic Rotation and the intensity of cosmic radiation\n(1939)\n. The\n1938\nand\n1939\npapers were joint publications with Shuichi Kusaka\n(1915\n-\n1947)\n. Let us note in passing that Kusaka tragically died while swimming at Beach Haven, New Jersey on\n31\nAugust\n1947\nwhen he became separated from his friends.\nWhile in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Graef attended courses in astronomy and astrophysics at Harvard University. After the award of his doctorate he remained at Harvard for a while and completed a World War II Draft Card on\n16\nOctober\n1940\n. On the Draft Card, he gives his employer as Harvard University and gives: height,\n5\n'\n8\n\"; weight,\n180\nlbs; complexion, dark; hair, brown; and eyes, grey. While he was at Harvard he met Luis Enrique Erro\n(1897\n-\n1955)\na Mexican astronomer who became a member of the administration in\n1940\ntasked with building an observatory in Tonantzintla, Puebla. This site has particularly favourable atmospheric conditions for an observatory. Erro asked Graef if he would be the founding deputy director of the Observatory project. Graef agreed and returned to Mexico in\n1941\nwhere he was appointed Professor of Physics at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. The National Astrophysical Observatory of Tonantzintla was dedicated in February\n1942\nin a ceremony attended by the President of Mexico, Manuel Ãvila Camacho. Erro was director and Graef deputy director of the Observatory until\n1944\n.\nOn\n30\nJune\n1943\nthe\nMexican Mathematical Society\nwas founded. The First National Congress of Mathematics in Mexico had been held in NovemberÂ\n1942\n, organised by\nAlfonso NÃ¡poles GÃ¡ndara\n,\nAlberto Barajas\nand Francisco JosÃ© Alvarez. At this Congress, a commission was set up consisting of the three organisers of the congress together with Carlos Graef, which was given the task of setting up the\nMexican Mathematical Society\n. At the first meeting of the Society on\n30\nJune\n1943\n,\nAlfonso NÃ¡poles GÃ¡ndara\nwas elected as the first president of the Society and Carlos Graef was elected the first vice-president from\n1943\nto\n1945\n.\nOn\n20\nFebruary\n1942\nGeorge David Birkhoff\ngave a lecture at the Astrophysical Congress in Puebla, Mexico, at a congress held to inaugurate the Tonantzintla Astrophysical Observatory. He outlined his new theory of relativity at the Congress, giving his lecture in English\n[\n2\n]\n:-\n... the people who had committed to the director Luis Enrique Erro to translate foreign scientific papers for some reason did not arrive on time and Erro had asked Graef to help him in the emergency by taking care of the translation.\nG D Birkhoff\nspoke in English as the first speaker and Graef listened attentively without interrupting him. At the end of the presentation, he made a very precise synthesis of the work, underlining the most interesting conclusions, inserting witty comments and expanding explanations on graphs and diagrams. After a few hours of this unexpected way of translating,\nHarlow Shapley\n, could not contain himself and interrupted the session to say: \"We are amazed at the transformation that a work undergoes when Graef translates it into Spanish. It becomes brighter and more understandable; as if the translator knew the article better than the author.\"\nGraef invited\nBirkhoff\nto work at the Institute of Mathematics in Mexico in\n1943\nand they worked with others developing the new theory.\nBirkhoff\nthen invited Graef to Harvard in\n1944\nand, as visiting professor of relativity and gravitation, he delivered a series of lectures. Graef published three papers in\n1944\n, which are reviewed as\n[\n20\n]\n,\n[\n21\n]\nand\n[\n22\n]\n. Graef entered the United States on\n30\nOctober\n1944\nand, while a guest at the Princeton University Mathematics Department, he was invited by\nAlbert Einstein\nto visit him in December\n1944\n. You can read Graef's description of this visit at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nThis description of Graef's visit to\nEinstein\nwas written in\n1955\nand was one of many popular articles that he wrote. Before that were:\nGalton's apparatus\n(1935)\n;\nCoriolis' acceleration\n(1935)\n;\nThe geodesics\n(1935)\n;\nFour dimensional space\n(1935)\n;\nHamilton's principle\n(1936)\n;\nElastic deformations\n(1937)\n;\nThe foundation of the Mexican Mathematical Society\n(1943)\n;\nMorphological affinities between mathematics and painting\n(1946)\n,\nSculpture and science\n(1950)\n; and\nMathematical space and physical space\n(1955)\n.\nReturning to Mexico in\n1945\n, Graef was appointed as director of the Institute of Physics, National Autonomous University. He held this post until\n1957\nwhen he became Director of the Faculty of Sciences. He was the main person involved in the founding of the\nMexican Physical Society\nin\n1951\n. Elected as the first President of the Society, he delivered the first expository lecture at the first meeting of the Society in the city of QuerÃ©taro on\n22\nApril\n1952\n[\n35\n]\n:-\nOn Tuesday evening, Dr Carlos Graef FernÃ¡ndez, President of the Society, delivered an invited popular expository lecture on \"Space, Time, Gravitation\", and on Wednesday evening Manuel Sandoval Vallarta gave another invited lecture on \"The Relation Between Cosmic Rays and Radio Waves Emitted by the Sun\". Both were attended by capacity audiences of about\n200\nwhich filled the\n17\nth century lecture hall to overflowing.\nIt is worth quoting from Graef's article\n[\n19\n]\nabout his experiences of the reorganisation of the National Autonomous University of Mexico which occurred in\n1952\n:-\nWhen the faculties and schools of the National Autonomous University of Mexico were moved from their old sites in the City to their magnificent building in the Ciudad Universitaria in\n1952\n, many new values were gained, but some very dear and appreciable values were also lost. For reasons of historical development, the faculties and schools moved to Ciudad Universitaria as intellectual islands, as they had been in Mexico City. There had been very little academic contact between one campus and another due to their different geographical location in the City. In this way the university dependencies went to their new city. Each one moved as an island. In the scree the links that had not existed in the centre were not established. Some university students hoped that by being all together in the Ciudad Universitaria a greater spiritual contact would be fostered; that the courses of the same subjects that are taught in different schools could be a bond of intellectual union. For example, we dreamed that all university students who had to acquire knowledge of analytical geometry would take that course in a Mathematics Department and have students from very different faculties as companions, all listening to the professional mathematician who taught them. The inertia of tradition was an insurmountable obstacle for this system that would have achieved a spiritual rapprochement among all university students. In many university structures around the world, including in the United States and Europe, this happens on a daily basis. When moving to Ciudad Universitaria, the link between the Faculty of Sciences and the Faculty of Engineering was lost.\nWe note that Graef worked in the Faculty of Science throughout his career although his initial studies had been in the Faculty of Engineering. Luis Estrada describes the teaching skills of Graef in\n[\n14\n]\n:-\nDr Graef distinguished himself as a great teacher. His classes mainly revolved around differential calculus, analytical geometry, and classical mechanics. He also gave courses on relativity, both special and general, on classical field theory, and on gravitation. Although he was aware of the achievements of modern physics - that based on quantum theory - he was, so to speak, a classical physicist. In his classes, he poured out enthusiasm and emotion when referring to the achievements of the human intellect in his explanations about space, time and the movement of bodies, which caused his students to continue studying what he pointed out. His expositions were very clear because he had the gift of communicating complex ideas in a simple way, for which he used analogies and metaphors based on everyday knowledge. He took advantage of his vast culture to exemplify his statements and told stories and anecdotes to support his teachings. He had a great sense of humour and liked to chat with the students, never missing a joke with which he was the first to laugh. His permanent attitude was to preach the charm of scientific knowledge and to enthuse everyone to take a look at it.\nGraef became involved in the nuclear industry and was a member of the Mexican Delegation to the International Atomic Energy Commission of the United Nations Organisation in\n1946\n. He served as a member of the Advisory Council of the National Nuclear Energy Commission from\n1956\nto\n1962\nand represented Mexico on the Board of Governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna, Austria from\n1960\nto\n1961\n. He then served as Coordinating Scientific Adviser of the National Nuclear Energy Commission from\n1962\nto\n1965\n. Graef was appointed as General Director of the Nuclear Centre of Mexico in\n1965\nand continued in this role until\n1970\n. After this he served on the General Counsel of the National Institute of Nuclear Energy from\n1971\nto\n1977\n. There were several newspaper reports on statements made by Graef, mostly in his nuclear energy roles. For some extracts, see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nHe retired from his position at the National Autonomous University of Mexico and was made Professor Emeritus in\n1979\n. He continued to work, however, being the founding Director of the Division of Basic Sciences and Engineering at the Metropolitan Autonomous University, Iztapalapa from March\n1974\nto February\n1976\n. He continued to work for the nuclear industry, being General Coordinator of the National Institute of Nuclear Research\n(1977\n-\n1978)\n, General Coordinator of Mexican Uranium\n(1979\n-\n1980)\n, and Manager of the Mexican Uranium Fuel Cycle\n(1980\n-\n1983)\n.\nThroughout his career, Graef received many honours and awards: in\n1945\nhe received the Manuel Ãvila Camacho Prize, awarded by the Instituto del Libro; the state of Durango awarded him their Francisco Zarco Medal; he received the National Prize for Sciences and Arts, in the area of Physical Mathematical and Natural Sciences, from the Government of Mexico in\n1970\n; he received the Academic Medal of the\nMexican Physical Society\nin\n1982\n; in the same year he received the Nabor Carrillo Flores Award for Nuclear Science and Technology; the National Autonomous University of Mexico gave him their National University Award for Teaching Exact Sciences in\n1985\n.\nLet us end with three quotations. First from Fernando Alba\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nWith Graef's death, Mexico loses one of its great teachers, researchers, and organisers; but there are many seeds that he sowed and that will continue fighting to magnify the University and our Country, which he loved so much.\nNext from Ariel Tejera\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nGalileo\nsaid that the world is an open book; only that it is written in mathematical characters. For Dr Graef it was easy to read them and, furthermore, when he described them they became luminous.\nFinally from Miguel Jose Yacaman\n[\n38\n]\n:-\nAbove all Graef had a warm and enthusiastic personality, and he was always willing to help students with homework problems or to discuss physics with colleagues. Listening to his class made one feel that physics was a beautiful and enjoyable science, worth being part of. Probably his best obituary was an anonymous note that appeared on the wall outside his classroom the day his death became known, written on a student's piece of paper: \"Graef we loved you, we will miss you.\"",
