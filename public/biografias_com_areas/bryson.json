  "biografia": "Plato\nand\nAristotle\nboth mention a mathematician called\nBryson,\nbut as is often the case, there is not complete agreement among scholars as to whether these refer to the same person or to two different people.\nAristotle\nmentions\nBryson of Heraclea,\nwho was the son of Herodorus of Heraclea. Bryson was a\nSophist\nand\nAristotle\ncriticises him both for his assertion that there is no such thing as indecent language, and also for his method of\nsquaring the circle\n. We do know some details of this methods of squaring the circle and, despite the criticisms of\nAristotle\n, it was an important step forward in the development of mathematics.\nAristotle\n's criticism appears to have been based on the fact that Bryson's proof used general principles rather than on geometric ones, but it is somewhat unclear exactly what\nAristotle\nmeant by this.\nDiogenes Laertius\ngives some other biographical details of Bryson, but these cannot all be correct since Bryson's interaction with a number of philosophers is stated, yet certain of these are impossible due to the dates during which these men lived. Perhaps the most likely of the details preserved by Diogenes Laertius is that Bryson was either a pupil of\nSocrates\nor of\nEuclid of Megara\n.\nIt is a little difficult to reconstruct exactly what Bryson's method of squaring the circle was. According to Alexander Aphrodisiensis, writing in about\n210\nAD, Bryson\ninscribed\na square in the circle and\ncircumscribed\na second square. Bryson then constructed a third square between the inscribed and circumscribed square\n(\nbut Alexander does not tell us how this third square was constructed\n)\n.\nAlexander then claims that Bryson's argument was that the circle was intermediate between the inscribed and circumscribed squares, the third square is also intermediate between the inscribed and circumscribed squares and therefore the third square equals the circle. Alexander then rightly points out that this argument of nonsense since, to use Alexander's example,\n8\nand\n9\nare both greater than\n7\nand less than\n10\nbut\n8\ndoes not equal\n9\n.\nIf indeed Alexander is right in what he attributes to Bryson then his contribution would not merit inclusion in this archive. However, other commentators attribute a much more significant argument to Bryson.\nThemistius\n, another ancient commentator, writes that Bryson claimed that the circle was greater than all inscribed polygons and less than all circumscribed polygons. It is unclear how quite how Bryson continued the argument but it seems likely that he was saying that by taking polygons with larger and larger numbers of sides then the difference the inscribed and circumscribed polygons could be made as small as we like so that a polygon intermediate between them will equal the circle to whatever degree of accuracy we chose.\nThis would be an improvement on\nAntiphon\n's argument and Bryson is getting close to the\nmethod of exhaustion\nas rigorously applied by\nArchimedes\n.\nWe know little else of Bryson. He wrote\nDiatribes\nwhich some accused\nPlato\nof stealing and indeed Bryson is claimed to have associated with Polyxenus who put forward philosophical arguments which appear in Plato's\nPramenides\nand could well be the arguments which were claimed stolen from Bryson's\nDiatribes\n.",
