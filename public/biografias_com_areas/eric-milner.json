  "biografia": "Eric Milner\nwas the son of Frederick C Milner\n(1905\n-\n1981)\n, born on\n28\nJuly\n1905\nin London, a fitter, turner and engine smith, and Annie Elizabeth Kluth\n(1905\n-\n2000)\n, born\n2\nJune\n1905\n, a mantle machinist. Although at this time it was typical for only the husband to work, nevertheless if he did not bring in enough in wages to support the family the wife would often help out taking in mending or similar work. This is exactly what happened here, for Frederick Milner was often out of work and Annie helped out with the finances as a seamstress. In fact at times his parents were not able to provide the necessary care due to their work and Eric was looked after by his grandmother. He was his parents' only child and he was brought up in Lewisham, in the south part of the city of London where, despite the hardship, he excelled at elementary school. When he was eleven years old he won a scholarship to the Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School. This independent school had been founded in\n1690\nand provided a high standard of education. In August\n1939\nWorld War II broke out and a Government Evacuation Scheme which had been planned since the summer of\n1938\nwas put into action. He lost his chance of being educated in Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School.\nEric Milner, like other children evacuated from London, was separated from his family. He was sent to live with a family near Reading where, not only was he separated from his parents, but he had to attend a school where he knew none of the other pupils. Frightened and alone, he ran away and went back to London. The authorities tried to find a more suitable place to send him but this took time and Eric wandered around the streets of London when he should have been at school. Eventually a new place was found for him to live where he was received with kindness and understanding. Despite highly disrupted school years, being a very intelligent boy, he managed to get by and enter King's College, London in\n1946\nto begin his university studies. By this time World War II had ended and King's College, which had been evacuated to the University of Bristol during the war, was again operating from London. It was a difficult time, however, with some of the buildings having been destroyed in the bombing of London.\nAt King's College, mathematics was part of the Faculty of Arts and the Faculty of Science when Milner began his studies.\nGeorge Temple\nwas head of mathematics at King's College, having returned from war work to take up his chair again in\n1945\n. Other members of the mathematics staff at this time were\nJohn Semple\nand\nGeorge McVittie\n.\nRichard Rado\njoined the department in\n1947\nand in the same year\nCharles Coulson\nbecame the chair of the Department of Theoretical Physics. Milner graduated with a First Class Honours degree in mathematics in\n1949\nhaving received the Drew Gold Medal as top ranked mathematics student in that year. He was awarded a Research Studentship which allowed him to continue his studies at King's College. For his M.Sc. degree he took two topics, Modern algebra and Quantum mechanics. His advisors for these topics were\nRichard Rado\nand\nCharles Coulson\n. His work was impressive and he was awarded an M.Sc. with distinction in\n1950\n. He then began research on quantum mechanics advised by\nCoulson\n, but after a year he left and travelled to Malaya. This may appear to be a very unusual decision by Milner, so to gain some understanding of why he made this decision, we quote from\n[\n3\n]\n:-\nThose who knew Eric only as a mature fellow-mathematician\n(\nand perhaps even worked closely with him\n)\nmay not have realised what a many-sided person he was. A colleague has described him as \"a remarkable mixture of Cockney street smartness, wild adventurer and uncompromising mathematician.\" He had considerable business acumen, and was also very athletic: he was a featherweight boxer for the University of London around\n1947\n, and took immediately to skiing when he was nearly forty. In his early youth, he did not contemplate an academic career: nothing in his family background would have suggested such a possibility. At that time, National Service was compulsory in Britain, and Eric applied to join the Royal Navy, in which his academic record would normally have secured a commission and in which he might well have made his career. He was disappointed to be rejected for the Navy because he was found to be somewhat deaf, a fact which had not previously been noticed. Joining the Army did not appeal to him; but service in other Commonwealth countries was a permitted alternative. Possibly his deafness could have secured exemption from any form of National Service, but the foregoing circumstances and an adventurous spirit may explain a decision to go to Malaya in\n1951\nto work as a tin assayer for the Straits Trading Company, a tin mining and smelting company.\nMilner sailed on the ship\nGlenroy\nfrom London to Singapore on his way to Malaya, leaving London on\n9\nOctober\n1951\n. He gave his U.K. address as '\n98\nBraidwood Road, Catford, London' and his occupation as 'Commercial Assistant'. At this time\nAlexander Oppenheim\nwas Dean of the Faculty of Arts of the University of Malaya in Singapore. This university had been founded in October\n1949\nin Singapore through a merger of King Edward VII College of Medicine and Raffles College. Also in\n1951\n, the mathematician Richard Guy\n(\nborn\n30\nSeptember\n1916)\nhad joined the Mathematics Department of the University of Malaya. Soon after both Guy and Milner arrived, they met socially and Guy tried hard to persuade Milner to give up his idea of working as a commercial assistant for the Straits Trading Company and join the Mathematics Department of the University of Malaya. Milner took a lot of persuading but eventually decided that he would give it a try.\nWhile he had been a student at King's College, London, Milner had met Esther Stella Lawton\n(\nknown as Estelle\n)\n. She had been born on\n5\nMay\n1929\nto George R Lawton\n(\nborn\n1\nMarch\n1900)\n, a Commercial Traveller, and his wife Caroline Marks\n(\nborn\n25\nJuly\n1904)\n. Milner married Estelle in the second half of\n1954\n, the marriage being registered in Willesden, Middlesex, England.\nMilner had proposed a problem to the\nAmerican Mathematical Monthly\n, which was published in February\n1953\n:-\nProve that for any positive integers,\nn\n,\nN\nn, N\nn\n,\nN\nthere are blocks of consecutive integers of length greater than\nN\nN\nN\n, with the property that each of their totients is divisible by\nn\nn\nn\n.\nThe\ntotient\nof a number\nm\nm\nm\nis the number of positive integers less than\nm\nm\nm\nwhich are coprime to\nm\nm\nm\n.\nWe see that despite Milner having been doing research on quantum mechanics while in London, he had becoame interested in number theory at the University of Malaya. This, however, is not surprising since both\nOppenheim\nand Guy were interested in number theory and combinatorics. In fact Milner's first research paper was the joint publication\nGeneralized decimals\n(1955)\nwith\nOppenheim\n. Milner's interest in number theory and combinatorial set theory was greatly increased by\nPaul ErdÅs\nwho made several visits to Singapore. In fact it may have been\nErdÅs\n's influence which finally convinced Milner that a university career in mathematics was right for him. Certainly it was through a suggestion by\nErdÅs\nthat Milner spent his sabbatical leave,\n1958\n-\n59\n, at the University of Reading with\nRichard Rado\n. Milner knew\nRado\nwell from his time at King's College, London, and\nRado\nhad moved to Reading to take up the chair of mathematics there in\n1954\n. Another strong influence on Milner's career was\nAndras Hajnal\nwhom he met in Reading in\n1958\n. The year\n1958\nwas important to Milner in other ways too, since Eric and Estelle's first child Suzanne was born in June of that year. We note at this point that Eric and Estelle Milner had three sons: Mark, Paul and Simon.\nBack in Singapore, Milner and\nOppenheim\npublished another joint paper,\nProperties of tetrahedra\n(1960)\n. He decided, however, that he would be better to try to return to Britain than to remain in Singapore; perhaps partly for family reasons and perhaps partly since there were changes in Singapore as it gained independence from Britain with a new constitution.\nRichard Rado\noffered him a lectureship at the University of Reading which he was happy to accept and took up his new post in January\n1961\n. His first two single authored papers were published in\n1962\n, namely\nChromatic graphs\nand\nA theorem of Schur\n, both in the\nBulletin\nof the\nMalaysian Mathematical Society\n.\nMilner had begun a Ph.D. at the University of London before going to Singapore so, back in Britain in a university post, he immediately decided to complete his doctorate, not in quantum mechanics but in his new area of interest, combinatorial set theory. He worked on his thesis as an external University of London student without a formal advisor but, in practice,\nRichard Rado\nacted as his advisor. He submitted his thesis\nSome combinatorial problems in set theory\nin\n1962\nand, after an oral examination by\nRichard Rado\nand Roy Davies, he was awarded the degree of Ph.D. in\n1963\n. His examiners declared the thesis to be \"of an exceptionally high standard.\"\nIn October\n1964\nMilner and\nRado\nsubmitted a joint paper\nThe Pigeon-Hole Principle for Ordinal Numbers\nto the\nLondon Mathematical Society\nand it was published in the\nProceeding\nof the Society in\n1965\n. The authors begin the paper as follows:-\nDirichlet\n's pigeon-hole principle\n(\nchest-of-drawers principle, Schubfachprinzip\n)\nasserts, roughly, that if a large number of objects is distributed in any way over not too many classes, then one of these classes contains many of these objects. Here we consider an extension of this principle, and investigate distributions of the elements of a well-ordered set into finitely or infinitely many classes.\nTwo of Milner's Singapore colleagues, Richard Guy and Peter Lancaster\n(\nborn\n1929)\n, had moved from Singapore to the University of Calgary in Canada. They tried to persuade Milner to take a position in Calgary and, in\n1967\n, he accepted a professorship at the University of Calgary. Milner spent the rest of his career in Calgary, becoming a Canadian citizen in\n1973\n. He served as head of the Department of Mathematics at Calgary from\n1976\nto\n1980\n.\nWhen we say that Milner \"spent the rest of his career in Calgary\" we mean that he continued to hold his permanent professorship there. He loved to travel and he spent time on research visits to other universities around the world: the University of Cambridge, England\n(1971\n-\n72)\n, the University of Tel Aviv, Israel\n(1972\nand\n1979\nand\n1986)\n, Merton College, Oxford, England\n(1978\n-\n79)\n, the University of Singapore, Singapore\n(1981\nand\n1984)\nand the UniversitÃ© Claude Bernard\n(\nLyon I\n)\n, France\n(1984\nand\n1985\n-\n86)\n.\nSadly Milner's wife Estelle died of cancer in Calgary on\n20\nFebruary\n1975\nat the age of\n45\n. In\n1979\nMilner married Elizabeth Forsyth Borthwick\n[\n3\n]\n:-\n... a school teacher who had formerly taught Inuit children within the Arctic Circle.\nEric and Elizabeth Milner had one son, Robert born in January\n1985\n.\nMilner was a plenary\n1\n-hour speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians held in Vancouver in August\n1974\n. He gave the talk\nTransversal Theory\n. He began his Introduction to the lecture as follows:-\nTransversal theory is a branch of combinatorial mathematics which is only just beginning to emerge as a reasonably connected and coherent subject. Whether this is yet rich enough or mature enough to be called a 'theory' may be a matter for debate; indeed, it is by no means certain that this part of mathematics may not finally be classified under some broader, more comprehensive title. However, what is beyond dispute is the fact that during the last two decades a large number of papers have been published which include some reference to the so-called marriage theorem, which is the starting point for transversal theory. These papers deal with surprisingly diverse problems and their only connecting link seems to be this common reference to the marriage theorem. The arguments employed have generally had an ad hoc flavour although some of these have been highly original. Transversal theory is a depository for developing those mathematical ideas of the marriage theorem type which frequently recur and which seem to belong to some more general framework.\nMilner's impressive research contributions are very well presented in\n[\n3\n]\n, where his complete publication list is given, so we will not attempt to give details here. We do note, however, the impressive list of his co-authors including\nAlexander Oppenheim\n,\nRichard Rado\n,\nPaul ErdÅs\n,\nAndras Hajnal\n, Richard Guy,\nEndre SzemerÃ©di\n,\nBÃ©la BollobÃ¡s\n, and\nSaharon Shelah\n.\nTo gain some idea of Milner's approach to mathematics we give some extracts from the talk \"The New Math in Paradise\", a popular lecture which Milner gave to the\nSingapore Mathematical Society\non\n19\nJune\n1991\n, at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nAmong the honours he received we mention his election as a Fellow of the\nRoyal Society of Canada\nin\n1976\nand the fact that he was the\nCanadian Mathematical Society\n's Jeffery-Williams Lecturer in\n1989\n.\nSt John Nash-Williams\nwrites about Milner's interests outside mathematics in\n[\n3\n]\n:-\nIn addition to demanding professional duties and prolific research, both performed to the highest standards, Eric found time and energy for much else, and enjoyed life to the full. He made two very happy marriages, and his family occupied a great deal of his attention. He was also a devoted son to his mother, who outlived him. People tell with particular warmth of the welcome and hospitality extended to numerous guests in the Milner household\n(\nduring both of his marriages\n)\n. His recreations included rugger, tennis, squash, dancing, chess, Go and other board and card games, sailing, mountain walking and ski-trekking. He derived much enjoyment from mountains and, for a number of years, owned an A-frame wooden weekend cottage in Canmore, near Banff, Alberta.\nMilner's health deteriorated and he was diagnosed with cancer. He retired in\n1996\nand died in the summer of the following year\n[\n3\n]\n:-\nHe will be remembered for outstanding contributions to research and teaching, but particularly, among those closest to him, as a gentle, caring and exceptionally nice man.",
