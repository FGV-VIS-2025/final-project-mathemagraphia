  "biografia": "Ãlie Cartan\n's mother was Anne Florentine Cottaz\n(1841\n-\n1927)\nand his father was Joseph Antoine Cartan\n(1837\n-\n1917)\nwho was a blacksmith. Let us trace these families back one more generation. Anne Cottaz was the daughter of FranÃ§ois Cottaz and FranÃ§oise Mallen while Joseph Cartan was the son of BenoÃ®t Bordel Cartan\n(\nwho was a miller\n)\nand Jeanne Denard. Joseph and Anne Cartan had four children: Jeanne Marie Cartan\n(1867\n-\n1931)\n; Ãlie Joseph Cartan, the subject of this biography; LÃ©on Cartan\n(1872\n-\n1956)\n, who followed his father and joined the family blacksmith business; and Anna Cartan\n(1878\n-\n1923)\n, who became a teacher of mathematics. Ãlie lived with his family in a house on Square Champ-de-Mars in Dolomieu. He remembered his childhood spent with the\n(\nquoted in\n[\n3\n]\n)\n:-\n... blows of the anvil, which started every morning from dawn. ... his mother, during those rare minutes when she was free from taking care of the children and the house, was working with a spinning wheel.\nThe family were very poor and, as Ãlie Cartan later said, his parents were\n(\nquoted in\n[\n3\n]\n)\n:-\n... unpretentious peasants who during their long lives demonstrated to their children an example of joyful accomplished work and courageous acceptance of burdens.\nIn late\n19\nth\ncentury France it was not possible for children from poor families to obtain a university education. It was Ãlie's exceptional abilities, together with a lot of luck, which made a high quality education possible for him. When he was in primary school he showed his remarkable talents which impressed his teachers M Collomb and M Dupuis. The latter said:-\nÃlie Cartan was a shy boy, but his eyes shone with an unusual light of great intelligence, and this was combined with an excellent memory.\nCartan may never have become a leading mathematician were it not for the young school inspector, later important politician, Antonin Dubost\n(1844\n-\n1921)\n. Dubost was at this time employed as an inspector of primary schools and it was on a visit to the primary school in Dolomieu, in the French Alps, that he discovered the remarkable young Ãlie. Dubost encouraged Ãlie to enter the competition for state funds to allow Ãlie to attend a LycÃ©e. His teacher M Dupuis prepared him to sit the competitive examinations which were held in Grenoble. An excellent performance allowed him to enter the CollÃ¨ge de Vienne which he attended for the five years\n1880\n-\n1885\n. Throughout his school career Dubost continued to support the young boy and obtain further financial support for him. After the CollÃ¨ge de Vienne, he then studied at the LycÃ©e in Genoble for the two years\n1885\n-\n87\nbefore completing his school education by spending one year at the Janson-de-Sailly LycÃ©e in Paris where he specialised in mathematics. The state stipend was extended to allow him to study at the Ãcole Normale SupÃ©rieure in Paris.\nCartan became a student at the Ãcole Normale SupÃ©rieure in\n1888\nwhere he attended courses by the leading mathematicians of the day including\nHenri PoincarÃ©\n,\nCharles Hermite\n,\nJules Tannery\n,\nGaston Darboux\n,\nPaul Appell\n,\nÃmile Picard\nand\nÃdouard Goursat\n. Cartan graduated in\n1891\nand then served for a year in the army before continuing his studies for his doctorate at the Ãcole Normale SupÃ©rieure. While Cartan was in the army, where he reached the rank of sergeant, his friend Arthur Tresse\n(1868\n-\n1958)\nwas studying under\nSophus Lie\nin Leipzig. On his return, Tresse told Cartan about\nWilhelm Killing\n's remarkable work on the structure of finite continuous groups of transformations. Cartan set about completing\nKilling\n's classification and he was able to benefit greatly from a six-month visit by\nSophus Lie\nto Paris in\n1892\n. During the two years\n1892\n-\n94\nthat Cartan spent working on his doctoral thesis, he was supported by a prestigious bursary from the Peccot Foundation. Cartan's doctoral thesis of\n1894\ncontains a major contribution to\nLie algebras\nwhere he completed the classification of the semisimple algebras over the complex field which\nKilling\nhad essentially found. However, although\nKilling\nhad shown that only certain exceptional simple algebras were possible, he had not proved that in fact these algebras exist. This was shown by Cartan in his thesis when he constructed each of the exceptional simple\nLie algebras\nover the complex field. His first papers, published in\n1893\n, were two notes stating his results on simple\nLie\ngroups. Robert Bryant writes in\n[\n12\n]\nthat in the\n1893\nnote:-\n... Ãber die einfachen Transformationgruppen ... he announces, in particular, that he has found examples of\nLie\ngroups corresponding to each of the 'exceptional' root systems found by\nKilling\n. One of the things that I find remarkable about this work is the way that Cartan found interpretations of the exceptional groups as transformation groups.\nCartan published full details of the classification in a third paper which was essentially his doctoral thesis. He obtained his doctorate in\n1894\nfrom the Faculty of Science at the Sorbonne. He was then appointed to the University at Montpellier where he lectured from\n1894\nto\n1896\n. Following this, he was appointed as a lecturer at the University of Lyon, where he taught from\n1896\nto\n1903\n. In Lyon in\n1903\nhe married Marie-Louise Bianconi\n(1880\n-\n1950)\n, the daughter of Pierre-Louis Bianconi who had been a professor of chemistry but had become an inspector in Lyon. Ãlie and Marie-Louise Cartan had four children:\nHenri Paul Cartan\n; Jean Cartan; Louis Cartan; and HÃ©lÃ¨ne Cartan. The eldest son,\nHenri Cartan\n, was to produce brilliant work in mathematics and has a biography in this archive. The two other sons died tragically. Jean, a composer of fine music, died of tuberculosis in\n1932\nat the age of\n25\nwhile their son Louis became a physicist at the University of Poitiers. He was a member of the Resistance fighting in France against the occupying German forces. After his arrest in February\n1943\nthe family received no further news but they feared the worst. Only in May\n1945\ndid they learn that he had been beheaded by the Nazis in December\n1943\n. By the time they received the news of Louis' murder by the Germans, Cartan was\n75\nyears old and it was a devastating blow for him. Their fourth child was a daughter HÃ©lÃ¨ne who became a teacher of mathematics at the LycÃ©e FÃ©nelon.\nIn\n1903\nCartan was appointed as a professor at the University of Nancy but he also taught at the Institute of Electrical Engineering and Applied Mechanics. He remained there until\n1909\nwhen he moved to Paris\n[\n3\n]\n:-\nIn\n1909\nCartan built a house in his home village Dolomieu, where he regularly spent his vacations. In Dolomieu Cartan continued his scientific research but sometimes went to the family smithy and helped his father and brother to blow the blacksmith's bellows.\nHis appointment in\n1909\nin Paris was as an assistant lecturer at the Sorbonne but three years later he was appointed to the Chair of Differential and Integral Calculus in Paris. From\n1915\nto\n1918\n, during World War I, he was drafted into the army where he continued to hold his former rank of sergeant. He was able to continue his mathematical career and, at the same time, work in the military hospital attached to the Ãcole Normale SupÃ©rieure. He was appointed as Professor of Rational Mechanics in\n1920\n, and then Professor of Higher Geometry from\n1924\nto\n1940\n. He retired in\n1940\nbut did not stop teaching at this point for he went on to teach at the Ãcole Normale SupÃ©rieure for girls.\nCartan worked on continuous groups,\nLie\nalgebras, differential equations and geometry. His work achieved a synthesis between these areas. He added greatly to the theory of continuous groups which had been initiated by\nLie\n. After the work of his thesis on finite continuous Lie groups, he later classified the semisimple\nLie\nalgebras over the real field and found all the irreducible linear representations of the simple\nLie\nalgebras. He turned to the theory of associative algebras and investigated the structure for these algebras over the real and complex field.\nJoseph Wedderburn\nwould complete Cartan's work in this area.\nHe then turned his attention to representations of semisimple\nLie\ngroups. His work is a striking synthesis of\nLie\ntheory, classical geometry,\ndifferential geometry\nand topology which was to be found in all Cartan's work. He applied\nGrassmann\nalgebra to the theory of exterior differential forms. He developed this theory between\n1894\nand\n1904\nand applied his theory of exterior differential forms to a wide variety of problems in differential geometry, dynamics and relativity.\nDieudonnÃ©\nwrites in\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nHe discussed a large number of examples, treating them in an extremely elliptic style that was made possible only by his uncanny algebraic and geometric insight and that has baffled two generations of mathematicians.\nIn\n1899\nCartan published his first paper on the\nPfaff\nproblem\nSur certaines expressions diffÃ©rentielles et le probleme de Pfaff\nâ\n(\nOn some differential expressions and a problem of Pfaff\n)\n. In this paper Cartan gave the first formal definition of a differential form. Victor Katz writes\n[\n26\n]\n:-\nHis definition was a \"purely symbolic\" one; namely, he defined \"differential expressions\" as homogeneous expressions formed by a finite number of additions and multiplications of the differentials dx, dy, d z , . ., and certain differentiable coefficient functions.\nOver the following years he wrote several other important papers on this topic including\nSur l'intÃ©gration de certaines systÃ¨mes de Pfaff de caractÃ¨re deux\nâ\n(\nOn the integration of certain Pfaff systems of  character two\n)\n(1901)\n. In\n1936\n-\n37\nhe delivered a series of lectures at the Sorbonne which covered his contributions to the topic. The lectures were published in\n1945\nin the book\nLes systÃ¨mes diffÃ©rentiels extÃ©rieurs et leurs applications gÃ©omÃ©triques\nâ\n(\nExterior differential systems and their geometric applications\n)\n.\nCartan's papers on differential equations are in many ways his most impressive work. Again his approach was totally innovative and he formulated problems so that they were invariant and did not depend on the particular variables or unknown functions. This enabled Cartan to define what the general solution of an arbitrary differential system really is but he was not only interested in the general solution for he also studied singular solutions. He did this by moving from a given system to a new associated system whose general solution gave the singular solutions to the original system. He failed to show that all singular solutions were given by his technique, however, and this was not achieved until four years after his death.\nFrom\n1916\nonwards he published mainly on differential geometry.\nKlein\n's 'Erlanger Programme' was seen to be inadequate as a general description of geometry by\nWeyl\nand\nVeblen\n, and Cartan was to play a major role. He examined a space acted on by an arbitrary\nLie\ngroup of transformations, developing a theory of moving frames which generalises the kinematical theory of\nDarboux\n. In fact this work led Cartan to the notion of a fibre bundle although he does not give an explicit definition of the concept in his work.\nCartan further contributed to geometry with his theory of symmetric spaces which have their origins in papers he wrote in\n1926\n. In these he developed ideas first studied by\nClifford\nand\nCayley\nand used topological methods developed by\nWeyl\nin\n1925\n. This work was completed by\n1932\nand so provides\n[\n1\n]\n:-\n... one of the few instances in which the initiator of a mathematical theory was also the one who brought it to completion.\nCartan then went on to examine problems on a topic first studied by\nPoincarÃ©\n. By this stage his son,\nHenri Cartan\n, was making major contributions to mathematics and Ãlie Cartan was able to build on theorems proved by his son.\nHenri Cartan\nsaid\n[\n24\n]\n:-\n[\nMy father\n]\nknew more than I did about\nLie\ngroups, and it was necessary to use this knowledge for the determination of all bounded circled domains which admit a transitive group. So we wrote an article on the subject together\n[\nLes transformations des domaines cerclÃ©s bornÃ©s\nâ\n(\nTransformations of areas bounded by circles\n)\n, C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris\n192\n(1931)\n,\n709\n-\n712]\n. But in general my father worked in his corner, and I worked in mine.\nCartan discovered the theory of spinors in\n1913\n. These are complex vectors that are used to transform three-dimensional rotations into two-dimensional representations and they later played a fundamental role in quantum mechanics. Cartan published the two volume work\nLeÃ§ons sur la thÃ©orie des spineurs\nâ\n(\nLectures on the theory of spinors\n)\nin\n1938\n[\n37\n]\n:-\nIn the preface to the two volumes ... M Cartan points out that, in their most general mathematical form, spinors were discovered by him in\n1913\nin his work on linear representations of simple groups, and he emphasises their connection ... with\nClifford\n-\nLipschitz\nhypercomplex numbers. ... M Cartan's book will be indispensable to mathematicians interested in the geometrical and physical aspects of group theory, giving, as it does, a complete and authoritative survey of the algebraic theory of spinors treated from a geometrical point of view.\nWe have given a list, as complete as possible, of all Cartan's French or English books at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nWe have given brief extracts from reviews of some of these books at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nAs to his teaching abilities,\nShiing-Shen Chern\nand\nClaude Chevalley\nwrite\n[\n14\n]\n:-\nCartan was an excellent teacher; his lectures were gratifying intellectual experiences, which left the student with a generally mistaken idea that he had grasped all there was on the subject. It is therefore the more surprising that for a long time his ideas did not exert the influence they so richly deserved to have on young mathematicians. This was perhaps partly due to Cartan's extreme modesty. Unlike\nPoincarÃ©\n, he did not try to avoid having students work under his direction. However, he had too much of a sense of humor to organize around himself the kind of enthusiastic fanaticism which helps to form a mathematical school.\nHe is certainly one of the most important mathematicians of the first half of the\n20\nth\ncentury.\nDieudonnÃ©\nwrites in\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nCartan's recognition as a first rate mathematician came to him only in his old age; before\n1930\nPoincarÃ©\nand\nWeyl\nwere probably the only prominent mathematicians who correctly assessed his uncommon powers and depth. This was due partly to his extreme modesty and partly to the fact that in France the main trend of mathematical research after\n1900\nwas in the field of function theory, but chiefly to his extraordinary originality. It was only after\n1930\nthat a younger generation started to explore the rich treasure of ideas and results that lay buried in his papers. Since then his influence has been steadily increasing, and with the exception of\nPoincarÃ©\nand\nHilbert\n, probably no one else has done so much to give the mathematics of our day its present shape and viewpoints.\nJ H C Whitehead\nwrites\n[\n48\n]\n:-\nÃlie Cartan is one of the great architects of contemporary mathematics.\nThe authors of\n[\n6\n]\nwrite:-\nCartan was one of the leading mathematicians of his generation, particularly influential for his work on geometry and the theory of\nLie Algebras\n. In the bleak years after World War I he was one of the most prominent mathematicians in France. He eventually became a notable influence on the\nBourbaki\ngroup, of which his son\nHenri\n, another distinguished mathematician, was one of the seven founder members.\nWilliam Hodge\nconsiders Cartan as\n[\n23\n]\n:-\n... a great mathematical genius taking in the scene in a broad survey, and picking out the essentials, so that with a master-stroke he goes straight to the heart of a problem. His knowledge of innumerable special cases, and his mastery of intricate argument, enabled him to advance his subject by giant strides, and make a lasting mark on the vast range of mathematical endeavour. By his death, the world has indeed lost one of the great architects of modern mathematics\nRobert Hermann writes\n[\n22\n]\n:-\nCartan is certainly one of the greatest and most original minds of mathematics, whose work on\nLie\ngroups, differential geometry, and the geometric theory of differential equations is at the foundation of much of what we do today. In my view, his place in mathematics is similar to that of the great turn-of-the-century masters in other areas of intellectual life. Just as Freud was influenced by the mechanistic world view of\n19\nth\ncentury science, but used this background to create something new and revolutionary which has profoundly influenced\n20\nth\ncentury thought, so Cartan built, on a foundation of the mathematics which was fashionable in the\n1890\n's in Paris, Berlin and GÃ¶ttingen, a mathematical edifice whose implications we are still investigating. His work was highly intuitive and geometric, but was also based on a formidable combination of original methods of calculation and analysis, ranging in mathematical expertise from algebra to topology.\nFor his outstanding contributions Cartan received many honours, but as DieudonnÃ© explained in the above quote, these did not come until late in career. He received honorary degrees from the University of Liege in\n1934\n, and from Harvard University in\n1936\n. In\n1947\nhe was awarded three honorary degrees from the Free University of Berlin, the University of Bucharest and the Catholic University of Louvain. In the following year he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Pisa. He was elected to the\nPolish Academy of Sciences\nin\n1921\n, the\nNorwegian Academy of Science and Letters\nin\n1926\n, the\nAccademia dei Lincei\nin\n1927\nand elected a Fellow of the\nRoyal Society of London\non\n1\nMay\n1947\n. Elected to the\nFrench Academy of Sciences\non\n9\nMarch\n1931\nhe was vice-president of the Academy in\n1945\nand President in\n1946\n. He became an honorary member of the\nLondon Mathematical Society\nin\n1939\n. A crater on the moon is named for him.\nA celebration was held on\n18\nMay\n1939\nin the Sorbonne to celebrate Cartan's\n70\nth\nbirthday. Many tributes were made by friends and colleagues who described his contributions to a wide range of different areas of mathematics. In\n1969\n, to celebrate the\n100\nth\nanniversary of Cartan's birth, a conference was held in Bucharest. The proceedings was published\n[\n5\n]\nand our list of references contains several papers delivered at that conference, namely\n[\n17\n]\n,\n[\n18\n]\n,\n[\n19\n]\n,\n[\n30\n]\n,\n[\n31\n]\n,\n[\n33\n]\n,\n[\n45\n]\n, and\n[\n46\n]\n. The conference 'The Mathematical Heritage of Ãlie Cartan' was held in Lyon, France from\n25\nJune to\n29\nJune\n1984\nto celebrate the\n115\nth\nanniversary of Cartan's birth.",
