  "biografia": "Warren Weaver\n's parents were Kittie Belle Stupfel and Isaiah Weaver who was a pharmacist. The family moved from Reedsburg to Madison, remaining in Wisconsin, in\n1904\n. It was in Madison that Weaver attended secondary school and also where he entered the University of Wisconsin.\nWeaver initially intended to train to become an engineer, but he was influenced to move towards applied mathematics and mathematical physics by his teachers, in particular\nMax Mason\n. The other influence on Weaver was Charles Slichter who was professor of mathematics at the University of Wisconsin and had earlier influenced\nMason\nto change from engineering to mathematics. Weaver was awarded a B.S. in\n1916\nand a C.E. in the following year. He then undertook doctoral studies writing that\nMason\n:-\n... had a great and lasting influence on a large number of graduate students. The mediocre ones found him pretty tough, but the really good ones almost worshiped him.\nWeaver was clearly in this latter category. However during the years that he was undertaking research for his doctorate Weaver had other jobs: he was assistant professor of mathematics at Throop Polytechnic Institute in Pasadena, California during\n1917\n-\n18\n. Throop Polytechnic Institute was founded in\n1891\nand assumed its present name of the California Institute of Technology\n(\nCaltech\n)\nin\n1920\n. Weaver also served in the U.S. Air Force from\n1917\nto\n1919\n, and married Mary Hemenway in\n1919\n; they had two children.\nAfter completing his war service in the Air Force, Weaver returned to Throop Polytechnic Institute in\n1919\nwhere he taught for a year as an assistant professor of mathematics before returning to Wisconsin-Madison to complete his doctoral studies; he was awarded his Ph.D. in\n1921\n. He was appointed to the Mathematics Department at Wisconsin-Madison and progressed to become a full professor. He was chairman of the mathematics department from\n1928\nto\n1932\n. During this period he collaborated with\nMason\nto write the monograph\nThe electromagnetic field\nwhich was published by the University of Chicago Press in\n1929\n.\n(\nIt was reprinted in\n1952\n.\n)\nHe was not, however, a creative mathematician and was much more at home helping to solve the problems which colleagues in science departments brought to the mathematics department. He felt that the natural step would be to set up an Applied Mathematics Institute at Wisconsin specifically to provide a service to scientists but he failed to convince the university that this was a good idea.\nThe father and son philanthropists both named John D Rockefeller founded the Rockefeller Foundation in\n1913\n.\nMax Mason\nwas the director of natural sciences of the Rockefeller Foundation during\n1928\n-\n29\n, and was president of the foundation during\n1929\n-\n36\n. After becoming president,\nMason\napproached Weaver to take up the post of director of the Natural Sciences Division. Weaver was appointed in\n1932\nand held the position until\n1957\n. Reingold writes\n[\n3\n]\n:-\nMason specifically brought Weaver to the Rockefeller Foundation to launch a new program for stimulating the use of the ideas and methods of the physical sciences in biology. ... As developed by Weaver, the program operated on a worldwide basis and stressed the acquisition of knowledge - that is, it was conscientiously pure science. ... Weaver personally chose the grantees; peer review was not his style.\nPerhaps Weaver is best known for his work as an applied mathematician during World War II. He headed the Applied Mathematics Panel of the Office of Scientific Research and Development from\n1943\nto\n1946\n. It\n[\n3\n]\n:-\n... provided mathematical consulting services to the armed forces and defense contractors on a wide range of tactical problems. It was a much-enlarged version of his proposed institute at the University of Wisconsin.\nDetails of the work of the Applied Mathematics Panel is given in\n[\n6\n]\n.\nMina Rees\nwas executive assistant to Weaver and she shows her admiration of his contributions in\n[\n7\n]\n. She describes the mathematical activities which were part of the war effort in World War II and of their impact on applied mathematics after the war.\nWeaver suffered a serious illness shortly after the end of the war. He was diagnosed with MÃ©niÃ¨re's disease, which is an illness of the ear leading to loss of hearing, ringing in the ears, dizziness, and the feeling of pressure in the ears. He spent several months in bed and was not able to return to his work at the Rockefeller Foundation until\n1946\n. He was appointed director of the Division of Science and Agriculture in\n1951\nand he held this position until he became vice president Natural and Medical Sciences of the Rockefeller Foundation in\n1955\n. By this stage he was in charge of all the sciences and continued in this role until he retired from the Foundation in\n1959\n.\nLet us mention another aspect of Weaver's work. He wrote an expository introduction to the general mathematical theory of communication which appeared as the second of two papers in\nThe Mathematical Theory of Communication\npublished by The University of Illinois Press  in\n1949\n. Some ideas are suggested in this paper by Weaver for a broader application of the fundamental principles of communication theory. He suggested that there were three levels of problems in communication:-\n.   How accurately can the symbols of communication be transmitted?\n(\nThe technical problem\n.\n)\nHow precisely do the transmitted symbols convey the desired meaning?\n(\nThe semantic problem\n.\n)\nHow effectively does the received meaning affect conduct in the desired way?\n(\nThe effectiveness problem\n.\n)\nThe second author of this book, who wrote the first paper consisting of about two-thirds of the work, was\nClaude E Shannon\n. The book was translated into German and appeared as\nMathematische Grundlagen der Informationstheorie\nin\n1976\n.\nWeaver was also famed for his popular writings on science. For example he wrote\nLady Luck\nin\n1962\ngiving a popular account of the\ntheory of probability\n. Other works such as\nA great age for science\nrapidly became dated as\n[\n3\n]\n:-\nSubsequent events converted Weaver's text into an interesting but irrelevant period piece.\nIn\nScience and Complexity\nwhich appeared in the\nAmerican Scientist\nin\n1948\nWeaver writes\n(\namong many other things\n)\nabout science and war:-\nOut of the wickedness of war have come two new developments that may well be of major importance in helping science to solve these complex twentieth-century problems. The first piece of evidence is the wartime development of new types of electronic computing devices. ...\n[\nTheir\n]\ncombination of flexibility, capacity, and speed makes it seem likely that such devices will have a tremendous impact on science. They will make it possible to deal with problems which previously were too complicated, and, more importantly, they will justify and inspire the development of new methods of analysis applicable to these new problems of organized complexity. The second of the wartime advances is the \"mixed-team\" approach of operations analysis. ... As an illustration, consider the over-all problem of convoying troops and supplies across the Atlantic. Take into account the number and effectiveness of the naval vessels available, the character of submarine attacks, and a multitude of other factors, including such an imponderable as the dependability of visual watch when men are tired, sick, or bored. Considering a whole mass of factors, some measurable and some elusive, what procedure would lead to the best over-all plan, that is, best from the combined point of view of speed, safety, cost, and so on? Should the convoys be large or small, fast or slow? Should they zigzag and expose themselves longer to possible attack, or dash in a speedy straight line? How are they to be organized, what defences are best, and what organization and instruments should be used for watch and attack?\nHaving worked for the private support of science for most of his life, Weaver's book\nU.S. Philanthropic Foundations : Their History, Structure, Management and Record\n(1967)\nis written by someone who understood intimately the workings of such institutions. In\n1977\nhe published\nEarly support for mathematics from Rockefeller agencies\nin\nHistoria Mathematica\nsurveying some of the contributions made by the Rockefeller philanthropic organizations in the\n1920\n's to mathematical sciences.\nLet us end this article by quoting from a talk\nFour pieces of advice to young people\ngiven in Seattle in\n1966\n:-\nI urge each one of you not to decide prematurely what field of science, what speciality of science you are going to make your own. Science moves very rapidly. ...\n... there is no life that is possible to be lived on this planet that is more pleasant and more rewarding than the combined activity of teaching and research.\n... may I urge every single one of you to prepare yourself not only to be a scientist, but to be a scientist-citizen. You have to accept the responsibilities of citizenship ...\nDo not overestimate science, do not think that science is all that there is, do not concentrate so completely on science that there's nobody in this room who is going to spend the next seven days without reading some poetry. I hope that there's nobody in this room that's going to spend the next seven days without listening to some music, some good music, some modern music, some music. I hope very much that there's nobody here who is not interested in the creative arts, interested in drama, interested in dance. I hope that you interest yourselves seriously in religion, because if you do not open your minds and open your activities to this range of things, you are going to lead too narrow a life.",
