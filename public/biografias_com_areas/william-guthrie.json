On\n21\nJuly\n1926\nhe graduated with an M.A. with First Class Honours in Mathematics and Natural Philosophy.

In addition to this post he was appointed he was elected Bursar of Faculty in\n1945\n, then Principal in October\n1958\n.\nIt was widely expected that Magee College would become the second university in Northern Ireland when a committee was set up to report.

The announcement of their engagement reads:-\n12\nOctober\n1938\n.
