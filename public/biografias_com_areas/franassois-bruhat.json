  "biografia": "FranÃ§ois Bruhat\n's parents were Georges Bruhat, who was assistant director of the Ãcole Normale SupÃ©rieure in Paris, and Berthe Hubert. FranÃ§ois attended the LycÃ©e Henri IV in Paris, going on to prepare for university entry at the LycÃ©e Saint-Louis, also in Paris. From there he entered the Ãcole Normale SupÃ©rieure where he studied for his AgrÃ©gÃ© de mathematique. He was appointed to the National Centre for Scientific research in\n1952\nand he worked there until\n1955\n.\nBruhat was among the first to understand the importance of distributions, as introduced by\nLaurent Schwartz\n, in the theory of\nLie groups\nand their representations and his doctoral thesis was devoted to these topics. He published\nSur les reprÃ©sentations induites des groupes de Lie\nâ\n(\nOn induced representations of Lie groups\n)\nin\n1953\non this topic and continued his investigations in\nIrrÃ©ductibilitÃ© des reprÃ©sentations induites des groupes de Lie\nâ\n(\nIrreducibility of induced representations of Lie groups\n)\nwhich was published in the following year. This paper considered induced representations which Bruhat then applied in his next paper\nReprÃ©sentations induites des groupes de Lie semi-simples complexes\nâ\n(\nInduced representations of complex semi-simple Lie groups\n)\n(1954)\nto a complex semi-simple Lie group none of whose simple factor groups is one of the exceptional simple Lie groups. In the same year his paper\nReprÃ©sentations induites des groupes de Lie semi-simples rÃ©els\nâ\n(\nInduced representations of real semi-simple Lie groups\n)\nappeared which dealt with the case of a real semi-simple Lie group. In a major\n108\npage paper\nSur les reprÃ©sentations induites des groupes de Lie\nâ\n(\nOn induced representations of Lie groups\n)\n(1956)\nBruhat gave a new theory in which he dealt with more restricted groups but was able to handle more general representations of them.\nAfter spending three years at the National Centre for Scientific Research, Bruhat was appointed as MaÃ®tre de ConfÃ©rences at the Faculty of Science in Nancy in\n1955\n. He was later promoted to professor of mathematics at Nancy. Bruhat published two papers which resulted from a collaboration with\nHenri Cartan\nin\n1957\n. These papers\nSur la structure des sous-ensembles analytiques rÃ©els\nâ\n(\nOn the structure of real analytic subsets\n)\nand\nSur les composantes irrÃ©ductibles d'un sous-ensemble analytique-rÃ©el\nâ\n(\nOn the irreducible components of an analytical real-subset\n)\ndeal with real analytic manifolds with singularities. Bruhat continued his study of real analytic manifolds in a collaboration with\nWhitney\n. A course of lecture given by Bruhat in India in\n1958\nwere published as\nLectures on Lie groups and representations of locally compact groups\nand reissued in\n1968\n. The lectures are in three parts. The first covers elementary properties of Lie groups, the second covers the general theory of measures on a locally compact group and representation in general, while the final part contains a construction of the continuous sum of Hilbert spaces, decomposition of a unitary representation into a continuous sum of irreducible representations and the\nPlancherel\nformula.\nIn\n1959\nBruhat lectured on Lie groups and Lie algebras at Recife in Brazil and his lecture notes were published as\nAlgÃ©bres de Lie et groupes de Lie : RÃ©sumÃ© des eleÃ§ons\nin the same year. Another lecture course, this time given in India, was published as\nLectures on some aspects of p-adic analysis\nin\n1963\n. By this time Bruhat had an appointment in Paris, having been appointed to the Faculty of Science there in\n1961\n. He was appointed to UniversitÃ© de Paris VII in\n1970\nand he held this post until\n1989\n. From\n1976\nto\n1981\nhe was vice-president of the university.\nTogether with\nJacques Tits\n, Bruhat developed the theory of simple algebraic groups over local fields. They published a number of notes containing their results in this area but a detailed account of the theory of reductive algebraic groups over local fields appeared in their joint\n250\npage paper\nGroupes rÃ©ductifs sur un corps local\npublished in\n1972\n.\nFinally we should mention that Bruhat was a member of\nBourbaki\nbeing a third generation member along with\nArmand Borel\n,\nAlexandre Grothendieck\n,\nPierre Cartier\n,\nSerge Lang\n, and\nJohn Tate\n.\nAmong the honours that Bruhat received were that he was made an Officer of the LÃ©gion d'Honneur and the national order of merit. He was also made Commandeur des Palmes AcadÃ©miques.",
