  "biografia": "James Gregory\nwas born in the Manse of Drumoak. This is a small parish on the river Dee, about fifteen kilometres west of Aberdeen. His father was John Gregory and his mother was Janet Anderson. John Gregory had studied at Marischal College in Aberdeen, then gone on to study theology at St Mary's College in the University of St Andrews before spending his life in the parish of Drumoak.\nTurnbull\nwrites\n[\n20\n]\n:-\n[\nJohn Gregory\n]\nwas a man of courage and foresight but was not conspicuous for outstanding intellectual gifts ...\nJames seems to have inherited his genius through his mother's side of the family. Janet Anderson's brother, Alexander Anderson, was a pupil of\nViÃ¨te\n. He acted as an editor for\nViÃ¨te\nand fully incorporated\nViÃ¨te\n's ideas into his own teaching in Paris. James was the youngest of his parents three children. He had two older brothers Alexander\n(\nthe eldest\n)\nand David, and there was an age gap of ten years between James and David.\nJames learnt mathematics first from his mother who taught him geometry. His father John Gregory died in\n1651\nwhen James was thirteen and at this stage James's education was taken over by his brother David who was about\n23\nat the time. James was given\nEuclid\n's\nElements\nto study and he found this quite an easy task. He attended Grammar School and then proceeded to university, studying at Marischal College in Aberdeen.\nGregory's health was poor in his youth. He suffered for about eighteen months from the quartan fever which is a fever which recurs at approximately\n72\n-hour intervals. Once he had shaken off this problem his health was good, however, and he wrote some years later that the quartan fever\n(\nsee for example\n[\n20\n]\n)\n:-\n... is a disease I am happily acquainted with, for since that time I never had the least indisposition; nevertheless that I was of a tender and sickly constitution formerly.\nGregory began to study optics and the construction of telescopes. Encouraged by his brother David, he wrote a book on the topic\nOptica Promota\n. In the preface he writes:-\nMoved by a certain youthful ardour and emboldened by the invention of the elliptic inequality, I have girded myself with these optical speculations, chief among which is the demonstration of the telescope.\nThe reader may not understand Gregory's reference to \"the elliptic inequality\" which in fact refers to\nKepler\n's discoveries. Gregory, in\nOptica Promota\n, describes the first practical reflecting telescope now called the Gregorian telescope.\nThe book begins with\n5\npostulates and\n37\ndefinitions. He then gives\n59\ntheorems on reflection and refraction of light. There follows propositions on mathematical astronomy discussing parallax, transits and elliptical orbits. Next Gregory gives details of his invention of a reflecting telescope. A primary concave parabolic mirror converges the light to one\nfocus\nof a concave ellipsoidal mirror. Reflection of light rays from its surface converge to the ellipsoid's second focus which is behind the main mirror. There is a central hole in the main mirror through which the light passes and is brought to a focus by an eyepiece lens. The tube of the Gregorian telescope is thus shorter than the sum of the focal lengths of the two mirrors. His novel idea was to use both mirrors and lenses in his telescope. He showed that the combination would work more effectively than a telescope which used only mirrors or used only lenses.\nThe book was only a theoretical description of the telescope for at this stage one had not been constructed. Gregory remarks in the book\n[\n21\n]\n:-\n... on his lack of skill in the technique of lens and mirror making ...\nIn\n1663\nGregory went to London. There he met\nCollins\nand a lifelong friendship began. One of Gregory's aims was to have\nOptica Promota\npublished and he achieved this. His other aim was to find someone who could construct a telescope to the design set out in his book.\nCollins\nadvised him to seek the help of a leading optician by the name of Reive who, at Gregory's request, tried to construct a parabolic mirror. His attempt did not satisfy Gregory who decided to give up the idea of having Reive construct the instrument. However,\nHooke\nlearnt of Reive's failed attempt at making the parabolic mirror and this would lead to a successful construction of the first Gregorian telescope around ten years later.\nIn London Gregory also met Robert Moray, president of the\nRoyal Society\n, and Moray attempted to arrange a meeting between Gregory and\nHuygens\nin Paris. However,\nHuygens\nwas not in Paris and the meeting did not materialise. Moray was to play a major role in Gregory's career somewhat later.\nIn\n1664\nGregory went to Italy. He visited Flanders, Rome and Paris on his journey but spent most time at the University of Padua where he worked on using infinite convergent series to find the areas of the circle and\nhyperbola\n. At Padua he worked closely with\nAngeli\nwhose\n[\n20\n]\n:-\n... teaching profoundly influenced Gregory, particularly in providing the twin keys to the calculus, the method of tangents\n(\ndifferentiation\n)\nand of quadratures\n(\nintegration\n)\n.\nIn Padua Gregory was able to live in the house of the Professor of Philosophy who was Professor Caddenhead, a fellow Scot. Two works which were published by Gregory while he was in Padua are\nVera circuli et hyperbolae quadratura\npublished in\n1667\nand\nGeometriae pars universalis\npublished right at the end of his Italian visit in\n1668\n.\nOf\nVera circuli et hyperbolae quadratura\nDehn\nand\nHellinger\nwrite in\n[\n5\n]\n:-\nIn this work Gregory lays down exact foundations for the infinitesimal geometry then coming into existence. It is remarkable that some decades later, at the time when analysis was in a state of revolutionary development, exactness was at a much lower standard than with Gregory, and generally with the authors writing before the discoveries of\nNewton\nand\nLeibniz\n(\ne.g.\nHuygens\n,\nMengoli\n,\nBarrow\n)\n.\nThe work we are dealing with is of quite a different character. On the one hand, the source from which he is getting his inspiration is quite unknown to us. On the other hand we find here a singular mixture of far-reaching ideas, exact methods, incomplete deductions, and even false conclusions.\nThe work was really trying to prove that Ï and e are transcendental but Gregory's arguments contain a subtle error. However, this should not in any way detract from the brilliance of the work and the amazing collection of ideas which it contains such as: convergence, functionality, algebraic functions, transcendental functions, iterations etc.\nBefore he left Padua Gregory published\nGeometriae pars universalis\nwhich is really\n[\n13\n]\n:-\n... the first attempt to write a systematic text-book on what we should call the calculus.\nThis book contained the first known proof that the method of tangents\n(\ndifferentiation in our modern terminology\n)\nwas inverse to the method of quadratures\n(\nintegration in our modern terminology\n)\n. Gregory shows how to transform an integral by a change of variable and introduces the\nx\nâ¦\nx\nâ\n0\n(\nx\n)\nx \\mapsto x - 0(x)\nx\nâ¦\nx\nâ\n0\n(\nx\n)\nidea which is the basis of\nNewton\n's fluxions. Perhaps it is worth saying a little about how Gregory's work relates to that of\nNewton\n. By the time that Gregory published this work\nNewton\nhad formed his ideas of the calculus so probably had not been influenced by Gregory. On the other hand\nNewton\nhad not said anything of his ideas and so certainly these ideas could not have influenced Gregory. Essentially\nNewton\nand Gregory were working out the basic ideas of the calculus at the same time, as, of course, were other mathematicians.\nGregory returned to London from Italy at about Easter\n1668\n. He had sent a copy of\nVera circuli et hyperbolae quadratura\nto\nHuygens\nand written a covering letter saying how he was looking forward to hearing the expert opinions of\nHuygens\non it.\nHuygens\ndid not reply but published a review of the work in July\n1668\n. In the review he raised some objections and also claimed that he had been the first to prove some of the results. On the one hand the summer months that Gregory spent in London were profitable, particularly through his friendship with\nCollins\n. It was a time of rapid mathematical development and Gregory found that\nCollins\n, with his up-to-date knowledge of developments, was most helpful to him. On the other hand he was upset by\nHuygens\n' comments which he took to imply that\nHuygens\nwas accusing him of stealing his results without acknowledgement.\nIt was indeed unfortunate that these two great mathematicians should enter into a dispute, although having said that it is worth noting that disputes were common at this time, particularly regarding priority. Looking at the dispute with the hindsight of today's understanding of the mathematics involved we can say that\nHuygens\nwas certainly unfair in suggesting that Gregory had stolen his results. Gregory had proved them independently and\nHuygens\nshould have realised that Gregory could not have known of them. However,\nHuygens\n' main mathematical objection to Gregory's proof is a valid one. Despite this there is brilliant work in this text and in\n[\n16\n]\nScriba shows how close Gregory was to making further major discoveries. He writes\n[\n16\n]\n:-\nClearly\n[\nGregory\n]\ncould not see the consequences that lay concealed in his construction. But he had an unerring sense of where they would lead ...\nThe dispute had another unfortunate consequence, namely that Gregory became much less keen to announce the methods by which he made his mathematical discoveries and, as a consequence, it was not until\nTurnbull\nexamined Gregory's papers in the library in St Andrews in the\n1930\ns that the full brilliance of Gregory's discoveries became known.\nWe can now be certain that during the summer of\n1668\nGregory was completely familiar with the series expansions of sin, cos and tan. He also established that\nâ«\nÂ Â\nsec\nâ¡\nx\nd\nx\n=\nlog\nâ¡\n(\nsec\nâ¡\nx\n+\ntan\nâ¡\nx\n)\n\\int Â Â \\sec x dx = \\log(\\sec x + \\tan x)\nâ«\nÂ\nÂ\nsec\nx\nd\nx\n=\nlo\ng\n(\nsec\nx\n+\ntan\nx\n)\nwhich solved a long standing problem in the construction of nautical tables. He published the\nExercitationes Geometricae\nas a counterattack on\nHuygens\n. Although he did not disclose his methods in the small treatise he discussed topics including various series expansions, the integral of the logarithmic function, and other related ideas.\nAlso during his time in London in the summer of\n1668\nGregory attended meetings of the\nRoyal Society\nand he was elected a fellow of the\nSociety\non\n11\nJune of that year. He presented various papers to the\nSociety\non a variety of topics including astronomy, gravitation and mechanics. We have already mentioned that Robert Moray was a member of the\nRoyal Society\nwith whom Gregory was friendly. Moray was a fellow Scot and a graduate of St Andrews. It is almost certain that it was through Moray that Charles II was persuaded to create the Regius Chair of Mathematics in St Andrews, principally to allow Gregory a position in which he could continue his outstanding mathematical research.\nGregory arrived in St Andrews late in\n1668\n. He was not attached to a College, as were the other professors, but given the Upper Hall of the university library as his place of work. It was the only university building which was not part of a college so was the only possible place for an unattached professor. Gregory found that St Andrews was of classical outlook where the latest mathematical work was totally unknown. In\n1669\n, not long after arriving in St Andrews, Gregory married Mary Jamesone who was a widow. They had two daughters and one son. After Gregory's death she married for a third time.\nMary Jamesone's father George Jamesone was a distinguished Scottish portrait painter. You can his painting of her  at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nWhile in St Andrews Gregory gave two public lecture each week which were not well received:-\n... I am often troubled with great impertinences: all persons here being ignorant of these things to admiration.\nHowever Gregory was to carry out much important mathematical and astronomical work during his six years in the Regius Chair. He kept in touch with current research by corresponding with\nCollins\n. Gregory preserved all\nCollins\n's letters, writing notes of his own on the backs of\nCollins\n's letters. These are still preserved in the St Andrews University library and provide a vivid record of how one of the foremost mathematicians of his day made his discoveries.\nCollins\nsent\nBarrow\n's book to Gregory and, within a month of receiving it, Gregory was extending the ideas in it and sending\nCollins\nresults of major importance. In February\n1671\nhe discovered\nTaylor series\n(\nnot published by\nTaylor\nuntil\n1715)\n, and the theorem is contained in a letter sent to\nCollins\non\n15\nFebruary\n1671\n. The notes Gregory made in discovering this result still exist written on the back of a letter sent to Gregory on\n30\nJanuary\n1671\nby an Edinburgh bookseller.\nCollins\nwrote back to say that\nNewton\nhad found a similar result and Gregory decided to wait until\nNewton\nhad published before he went into print. He still felt badly about his dispute with\nHuygens\nand he certainly did not wish to become embroiled in a similar dispute with\nNewton\n.\nThe feather of a sea bird was to allow Gregory to make another fundamentally important scientific discovery while he worked in St Andrews. The feather became the first diffraction grating but again Gregory's respect for\nNewton\nprevented him going further with this work. He wrote:-\nLet in the sun's rays by a small hole to a darkened house, and at the hole place a feather\n(\nthe more delicate and white the better for this purpose\n)\n, and it shall direct to a white wall or paper opposite to it a number of small circles and ovals\n(\nif I mistake them not\n)\nwhereof one is somewhat white\n(\nto wit, the middle which is opposite the sun\n)\nand all the rest severally coloured. I would gladly hear Mr\nNewton\n's thoughts of it.\nThe Upper Room of the library had an unbroken view to the south and was an excellent site for Gregory to set up his telescope. Gregory hung his pendulum clock on the wall beside the same window. The clock, made by Joseph Knibb of London, was purchased in\n1673\n.\nHuygens\npatented the idea of a pendulum clock in\n1656\nand his work describing the theory of the pendulum was published in\n1673\n, the year Gregory purchased his clock.\nIn\n1674\nGregory cooperated with colleagues in Paris to make simultaneous observations of an eclipse of the moon and he was able to work out the longitude for the first time. However he had already begun work on an observatory. In\n1673\nthe university allowed Gregory to purchase instruments for the observatory, but told him he would have to make applications and organise collections for funds to build the observatory. Gregory went home to Aberdeen and took a collection outside the church doors for money to build his observatory. On\n19\nJuly\n1673\nGregory wrote to\nFlamsteed\n, the Astronomer Royal, asking for advice. He then travelled to England to purchase instruments.\nGregory left St Andrews for Edinburgh in\n1674\n. His reasons for leaving again paint a sorry picture of prejudice against the brilliant mathematician. Writing after taking up his Edinburgh Chair Gregory said:-\nI was ashamed to answer, the affairs of the Observatory of St Andrews were in such a bad condition, the reason of which was, a prejudice the masters of the University did take at the mathematics, because some of their scholars, finding their courses and dictats opposed by what they had studied in the mathematics, did mock at their masters, and deride some of them publicly. After this, the servants of the colleges got orders not to wait on me at my observations: my salary was also kept back from me, and scholars of most eminent rank were violently kept from me, contrary to their own and their parents wills, the masters persuading them that their brains were not able to endure it.\nIn Edinburgh Gregory became the first person to hold the Chair of Mathematics there. He was not to hold the Chair for long, however, for he died almost exactly one year after taking up the post. It was a year in which he was still very active in research in both astronomy and mathematics. On the latter topic he had become interested in the problem of solving quintic equations algebraically and made some interesting discoveries on Diophantine problems. His death came suddenly. One night he was showing the moons of Jupiter to his students with his telescope when he suffered a stroke and became blind. He died a few days later at the young age of\n36\n. Whiteside writes in\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nFor all his talent and promise of future achievement, Gregory did not live long enough to make the major discovery which would have gained him popular fame. For his reluctance to publish his \"several universal methods in geometry and analysis\" when he heard through\nCollins\nof\nNewton\n's own advances in calculus and infinite series, he postumously paid a heavy price ...\nWe have mentioned in this article many of the brilliant ideas which are due to Gregory. However, we now summarise these and other contributions in the hope that, despite his reluctance to publish his methods, his remarkable contributions might indeed be more widely understood: Gregory anticipated\nNewton\nin discovering both the interpolation formula and the general binomial theorem as early as\n1670\n; he discovered\nTaylor\nseries more than\n40\nyears before\nTaylor\n; he solved\nKepler\n's famous problem of how to divide a semicircle by a straight line through a given point of the diameter in a given ratio\n(\nhis method was to apply\nTaylor\nseries to the general cycloid\n)\n; he gives one of the earliest examples of a comparison test for convergence, essentially giving\nCauchy\n's ratio test, together with an understanding of the remainder; he gave a definition of the integral which is essentially as general as that given by\nRiemann\n; his understanding of all solutions to a differential equation, including singular solutions, is impressive; he appears to be the first to attempt to prove that Ï and\ne\ne\ne\nare not the solution of algebraic equations; he knew how to express the sum of the\nn\nn\nn\nth powers of the roots of an algebraic equation in terms of the coefficients; and a remark in his last letter to\nCollins\nsuggests that he had begun to realise that algebraic equations of degree greater than four could not be solved by radicals.",
