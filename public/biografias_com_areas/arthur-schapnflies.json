  "biografia": "Arthur SchÃ¶nflies\n's father, Moritz Isaaks SchÃ¶nflies\n(1812\n-\n86)\n, manufactured cigars in Landsberg, a city about\n130\nkm east of Berlin. Arthur's mother was Johanna Hirschfeld\n(1817\n-\n1879)\n, from Pyryce in Pomerania, the daughter of Samuel Hirschfeld and RÃ¶sel Boas. The wealthy Jewish SchÃ¶nflies family had a son Samuel Martin SchÃ¶nflies who was about ten years older than Arthur. Martin SchÃ¶nflies also trained as a mathematician and obtained a doctorate. Being much older than Arthur and following the same educational path, he was a strong influence on his younger brother.  Arthur entered the\nGymnasium\nin Landsberg in\n1862\nand studied there until\n1870\n. The Franco-Prussian War began in July\n1870\nbut the French troops had surrendered in September\n1870\nbefore SchÃ¶nflies became a student at the Friedrich-Wilhelms University of Berlin. He studied there until\n1875\nworking under\nEduard Kummer\nand\nKarl Weierstrass\nbut he also attended lectures by\nSiegfried Heinrich Aronhold\nat the Berlin Industrial Institute, an institution which would later become part of the Technical University of Berlin. After the award of a degree which entitled him to teach mathematics in Gymnasiums, he spent the year\n1876\nas a probation teacher at the Friedrich-Wilhelms-Gymnasium in Berlin. During this time, as well as learning practical teaching skills he was undertaking research for his doctorate following suggestions made by\nAronhold\n. Since the Berlin Industrial Institute could not award doctorates, SchÃ¶nflies had to have formal advisors at the University of Berlin. He obtained a doctorate from the Philosophical Faculty of the University of Berlin on\n2\nMarch\n1877\nfor his thesis\nSynthetisch-geometrische Untersuchungen Ã¼ber FlÃ¤chen zweiten Grades und eine aus ihnen abgeleitete RegelflÃ¤che\nâ\n(\nSynthetic-geometric investigations of surfaces of the second degree and ruled surfaces derived from them\n)\n.\nFollowing the award of his doctorate, SchÃ¶nflies continued teaching at a Friedrich-Wilhelms-Gymnasium in Berlin. In\n1880\nhe went to Colmar in Alsace to teach at the Gymnasium there but he had his sights set on an academic career and was working on his\nhabilitation\nthesis. He presented this thesis to the University of GÃ¶ttingen in\n1884\nand began teaching there as a\ndozent\n.\nFelix Klein\nworked to set up a chair of applied mathematics at GÃ¶ttingen and in\n1892\nSchÃ¶nflies was appointed to this chair. However,\nKlein\nhad great difficult with making the appointment due to the fact that SchÃ¶nflies was Jewish.\nHermann Amandus Schwarz\nleft GÃ¶ttingen in\n1892\nto fill\nWeierstrass\n's chair in Berlin and\nKlein\nwanted\nAdolf Hurwitz\nto fill the vacancy. However,\nHurwitz\nwas Jewish and\nKlein\nrealised that he would not be able to get approval for two Jewish appointments. He wrote to\nHurwitz\n(\nsee\n[\n11\n]\n)\n:-\nThere is ... - I must touch on it, as repugnant as the matter is to me, and knowing full well your justified sensitivity to this - the Jewish question. Not that your call as such would present difficulties; these I would be able to overcome. The problem is that we already have Arthur SchÃ¶nflies, for whom I would like to create a firm position as salaried Extraordinariuis. And having you and SchÃ¶nflies together is something I will not get past either the faculty or the Minister.\nHurwitz\n, perhaps because of anti-Semitism, was not appointed and the Prussian Ministry of Education appointed\nHeinrich Weber\nto fill\nSchwarz\n's chair.\nKlein\nwas furious and redoubled his efforts to have SchÃ¶nflies made an extraordinary professor. He wrote to the Prussian Ministry of Education saying that the situation\n(\nsee\n[\n11\n]\n)\n:-\n... can only be somewhat remedied by having SchÃ¶nflies named Extraordinarius. On the one hand, it is known that I have been working on his appointment for years, on the other, that my efforts have only met with resistance, so that I only dispensed from doing so as\nHurwitz\n's call stood in question. Should SchÃ¶nflies now be passed over, this impression\n[\ni.e., of\nKlein\n's impotence\n]\nwill become a virtual certainty. I would then be forced to advise young mathematicians not to turn to me, if they hope to make further advancements in Prussia.\nDavid Rowe writes\n[\n11\n]\n:-\nShortly after this letter was written Arthur SchÃ¶nflies was appointed ausserordentlicher Professor in GÃ¶ttingen, where for the next seven years he attracted droves of students to his classes in descriptive geometry.\nWhile SchÃ¶nflies was on the faculty at GÃ¶ttingen, he married Emma Levin\n(1868\n-\n1939)\n, the daughter of Albert Louis Levin, in Berlin on\n7\nApril\n1896\n. Arthur and Emma SchÃ¶nflies had one son Albert\n(\nborn\n1898)\nand four daughters Hanna\n(\nborn\n1897)\n, Elizabeth\n(\nborn\n1900)\n, Eva\n(\nborn\n1901)\nand Lotte\n(\nborn\n1905)\n. Two of his five children were murdered by the Nazis in\n1944\n: Albert who died in the Auschwitz concentration camp, and Eva. Lotte, Hanna and Elizabeth died in\n1981\n,\n1985\nand\n1991\nrespectively. SchÃ¶nflies left GÃ¶ttingen in\n1899\nto take up a chair at the University of KÃ¶nigsberg, then in\n1911\nhe became professor at the Academy for Social and Commercial Sciences in Frankfurt. He participated in the founding of the University of Frankfurt in\n1914\n, became the first Dean of the Science Faculty, and played a significant role in establishing its first Department of Mathematics. SchÃ¶nflies ended his career at the University of Frankfurt where he served as professor from\n1914\nuntil\n1922\nbeing rector of the University in the session\n1920\n-\n21\n.\nSchÃ¶nflies worked first on geometry and kinematics but became best known for his work on set theory and crystallography. He published the book\nGeometrie der Bewegung in synthetischer Darstellung\nâ\n(\nThe geometry of the movement in synthetic representation\n)\nin\n1886\n.\nFrank Morley\nwrites\n[\n10\n]\n:-\nThe main idea of the book is to consider a body in two or more positions relatively to another body, and thence as a limit case to discuss the instantaneous motion. Full advantage is taken of the duality arising from viewing things from the standpoint of the one body or the other.\nKlein\nsuggested the problem of finding the crystallographic space\ngroups\nin the late\n1880\ns. By\n1891\nSchÃ¶nflies had found the complete list of\n230\nsuch groups. His presentation of crystallographic space groups published in\nKrystallsysteme und Krystallstruktur\nâ\n(\nCrystal systems and crystal structure\n)\n(1892)\nused the latest aspects of group theory and became a classic on the subject. The book also includes the SchÃ¶nflies notation, one of the two conventions still used today to describe crystallographic point groups. In fact the classification of the crystallographic space groups was made independently by E S Fedorov. SchÃ¶nflies corresponded with Fedorov and they corrected some minor errors in both classifications before publishing their classification. Rolf Schwarzenberger writes\n[\n12\n]\n:-\nIn\n1879\nSohncke had listed\n66\ngroups consisting entirely of \"movements\"\n(\ni.e. orientation-preserving symmetries\n)\nthus completing a very incomplete list drawn up by\nJordan\nten years earlier. Both Fedorov and SchÃ¶nflies were stimulated by noticing a mistake in Sohncke's work\n(\none\nsymmetry group\nwas listed twice, giving\n65)\nand went on to count all symmetry groups, including those which include some orientation-reversing symmetries. Between\n1889\nand\n1891\nthey got different results:\nFedorov\n229\ngroups\n(\n+\n2\nomitted -\n1\nduplicated =\n230)\nSchÃ¶nflies\n227\ngroups\n(\n+\n4\nomitted -\n1\nduplicated =\n230)\nbut eliminated errors by mutual correspondence. Only in\n1892\ndid Fedorov publish a complete list showing the match between the two lists and making the often quoted remark: \"... an extremely surprising circumstance has come to light, viz a coincidence in the work of two researchers such as has, perhaps, never been observed in the history of science\" which has been misinterpreted as a statement that Fedorov and SchÃ¶nflies worked in complete isolation from each other\n(\nand in England further embroidered to include the fiction that Barlow independently arrived at the same result; in fact he knew of the Fedorov/SchÃ¶nflies papers but tried to obtain the same results direct from Sohncke's work by a different method and obtained a false result\n229\neven though - as Fedorov pointed out - \"... he had more than one complete list in front of him\"\n)\n.\nSchÃ¶nflies republished his classification in\n1923\nin\nTheorie der Kristallstruktur\n. R W G Wyckoff writes\n[\n17\n]\n:-\nThis book is essentially a new edition of Professor Schoenflies' 'Krystallsysteme und Krystallstruktur'\nâ\n(\nCrystal systems and crystal structure\n)\nwhich appeared in\n1891\n. Like its predecessor its primary concern is the deduction of the\n230\ncrystallographically significant space groups. Though remaining purely geometric in the details of its reasoning, this deduction has been so rewritten as to make it somewhat shorter and more concise. The insertion of numerous figures is a great help towards the picturing of individual groups. As before these groups are described through the statement of both their sub-groups and the coordinates of equivalent positions within them. This description has, however, been amplified and improved through a listing of the symmetry properties associated with points lying in elements of symmetry. Since the discovery of X-ray diffraction the theory of space groups has become of immediate and every day use in experimental physics. The realization of this changed importance has inevitably influenced Professor Schoenflies' treatment and has led him to lay greater stress upon items of applied crystallographic interest. A chapter has accordingly been inserted which outlines the practical usefulness of space groups in studies of the positions of atoms in crystals. Although this account will not meet the needs of the practicing crystal analyst, Professor Schoenflies' books remain the only suitable source of information for those interested in the derivation of space groups.\nIn around\n1895\nSchÃ¶nflies turned his attention towards set theory and\ntopology\n. He wrote many works which were important at the time they were published but they were rather superseded by\nHausdorff\n's\nGrundzÃ¼ge der Mengenlehre\nâ\n(\nGeneral set theory\n)\nin\n1914\n. Three important papers on plane topology proved the topological invariance of the dimension of the square. He introduced the topological notions of accessible point, closed curve and simple closed curve. However, his work contains gaps and errors which were investigated by\nBrouwer\nwho made some deep discoveries from studying these errors.\nBrouwer\npresented counterexamples to some of SchÃ¶nflies's theorems showing that the notion of closed curve was more complicated than SchÃ¶nflies had realised.\nWe should note the important contributions that SchÃ¶nflies made to set theory in publishing the two-hundred and fifty page report on set theory\nDie Entwickelung der Lehre von den Punktmannigfaltigkeiten\nâ\n(\nThe development of the theory of point manifolds\n)\n(1899)\n, a substantial part of which studies transfinite numbers. In this work he was the first to give the name '\nHeine\n-\nBorel\ntheorem' to the theorem which today is always known by this name. SchÃ¶nflies tells the reader that the proof of the\nHeine\n-\nBorel\ntheorem is one of the most significant applications of transfinite numbers. He goes on to say\n(\nsee for example\n[\n9\n]\n)\n:-\n... recent works have conferred on\n[\ncountable ordinals\n]\nan ever increasing importance. They have found application in many domains and have shown themselves to be natural symbols, in particular whenever indefinitely many sequences of limit processes occur.\nHe went on to write two further important papers on set theory:\nZur Erinnerung an Georg Cantor\nâ\n(\nIn memory of Georg Cantor\n)\n(1922)\nand\nDie Krisis in Cantor's Mathematischem Schaffen\nâ\n(\nThe crisis in Cantor's mathematical work\n)\n(1927)\n. The first of these contains charming personal comments from SchÃ¶nflies who had witnessed the mathematical revolution at first hand. For example\n(\nsee\n[\n9\n]\n)\n, SchÃ¶nflies writes:-\n[\nHurwitz\n]\npraised\nCantor\nas the one to whom the credit for the recent success in function-theory was due. I was able to witness the radiant satisfaction which\nCantor\nfelt, and I can still recall the shining brilliance of his large round eyes reflecting that satisfaction.\nIn his\n1927\narticle, SchÃ¶nflies gives the reader insight into\nCantor\n's thoughts. For example, SchÃ¶nflies puts\nCantor\n's contributions into three categories: general set theory and point-set theory; the theory of transfinite numbers; and his philosophical arguments. He writes\n(\nsee\n[\n9\n]\n)\n:-\n[\nCantor\n]\nattached equal importance to all these, since he gave the same devotion to all his ideas, including the non-mathematical. This was not the position taken by the scientific community. If he didn't find the reception he wanted for his philosophical ideas he probably got over this fairly quickly. This was not the case as far as the second number-class\n[\ncountable ordinals\n]\nwas concerned .... For this\n[\ni.e. countable ordinals\n]\nhe found no approval among the powers that be: he was not mistaken in thinking that even Weierstrass was in this respect at best only lukewarm towards him.\nSchÃ¶nflies also wrote on kinematics and\nprojective geometry\n. He wrote textbooks on descriptive geometry and analytic geometry, and a calculus textbook\nEinfÃ¼hrung in die mathematische Behandlung der Naturwissenschaft\nâ\n(\nIntroduction to the mathematical treatment of natural science\n)\n(1895)\nwritten jointly with Walter Nernst. This work, which had reached its eleventh edition by\n1931\n, was written primarily for students of physics and chemistry, but engineers also made considerable use of the text. In\n1895\nSchÃ¶nflies edited PlÃ¼cker's complete works. Otto Laporte, a theoretical physicist, spent a year in Frankfurt in\n1920\n. In an interview late in his life he spoke about SchÃ¶nflies:-\nWhen I went to Frankfurt, right away I was under the influence of some very great men. The oldest one there was a mathematician named Arthur SchÃ¶nflies, whom you know, of course, as the man who first formalised the theory of space groups of lattices, but who has many, many other great achievements. He was then an old man, but he gave beautiful courses.\nAmong the many honours that SchÃ¶nflies received we mention his election to membership of the\nGerman Academy of Scientists Leopoldina\nin\n1896\n, to corresponding member of the Royal Society of Sciences in Liege in\n1904\n, and corresponding member of the\nBerlin Academy of Scientists\nin\n1918\nwho specifically cited his contributions to promoting\nCantor\n's ideas on set theory. In\n1910\nhe was awarded the Red Eagle Order IV Class by the German Emperor and appointed as a Privy Councillor in\n1916\n. We also note that he was a founder member of the\nGerman Mathematical Society\n(\nDeutsche Mathematiker-Vereinigung\n)\nin\n1890\n.",
