  "biografia": "Chukwuka Okonjo\nspoke of his parents in\n[\n5\n]\n:-\nMy father used to be a teacher working with the Nigerian Railway Corporation\n(\nNRC\n)\nin Lagos. Though it was a normal thing; I was happy I had a father and mother who liked and did things for me and my younger ones. ... I went to school because my father was a teacher. He told me many things which other people didn't know. So I did those things and he saw to it that I got as much education as possible and it seemed that I did slightly better than other people who were around. He said I should further my education so that I would become a \"big man.\"\nFor a version of the interview\n[\n5\n]\nsee\nTHIS LINK\n.\nOkonjo began his education at the age of six at the government school in the town of his birth Ogwashi-Ukwu. In the following year,\n1935\n, his family moved to Lagos and he went to the Ladi-Lak Institute, Yaba, Lagos. This school had only been founded one year earlier, on\n4\nJune\n1934\n, by the lawyer Rita Akaje Macaulay. It was a small primary school with only four pupils in its first year. Okonjo was at this school for three years until\n1938\nwhen he went to the government school, Lagos where he spent the academic year\n1938\n-\n39\n.\nIn\n1939\nOkonjo began his secondary education at King's College, Yaba, Lagos. This school, established in\n1909\n, aimed:-\n... to produce students of profound character and academic distinction - men who would build an independent Nigeria.\nIn\n1944\nOkonjo moved from to the  Dennis Memorial Grammar School, Onitsha where he spent the year\n1944\n-\n45\n. This school, founded and run by the Church Mission Society, was established in\n1925\n, nearly\n70\nyears after the Society began its mission in the area. This long delay was due to the Society believing for a long time that its role was the propagation of Christianity for which secondary education was not necessary. By the time Okonjo attended the school, it had made great efforts to provide top quality science teaching in line with government policy. E D C Clark was principal at this time and had improved standards. Okonjo was awarded University of Cambridge Overseas School Certificate in\n1945\n.\nThe Higher College, Yaba, had been founded in\n1932\nand the most brilliant pupils from the Dennis Memorial Grammar School went there to follow higher academic courses. Okonjo followed this route, attending Higher College, Yaba from\n1946\n. This college, opened in January\n1934\nin Yaba, a town which has now become a suburb of Lagos, was a men's college which was affiliated with the University of London, England. The college trained science teachers and offered diplomas but students wanting higher education had to study correspondence courses and obtain degrees from the University of London.\nOkonjo attended University College, Ibadan in\n1948\n-\n49\n, but registered for correspondence courses with the University of London. University College, Ibadan, was established in\n1948\n, the year Okonjo began his studies there, as a College of the University of London, being the first university to be established in Nigeria. It became an independent university, the University of Ibadan, in\n1962\nafter the country gained its independence from Britain. Okonjo was awarded a Diploma in Education in\n1949\n.\nHis studies as an external student of the University of London from\n1948\nto\n1951\nled to Okonjo being awarded a B.Sc. in Mathematics, Logic and Scientific Method in\n1951\n. He had studied as a University of London external student while teaching at various schools in Nigeria. He had been a Tutor at Government College, Umuahia\n(1949\n-\n50)\n, a Tutor at West Boys High School, Benin City\n(1950\n-\n51)\n, and Principal of Ibadan Boys' Grammar School\n(1952\n-\n55)\n. Nurudeen Olorun-Nimbe Adedipe writes in\n[\n4\n]\n:-\nThe dominant rationale, which made all the difference, was the personality of the then Principal, then MrÂ Chukwuka OkonjoÂ\n(\nnow Professor Okonjo\n)\nwho, himself, lived practically with the boarders across the street. If he, a whole Principal, with King'sÂ College background, could live there, so could I! If he, a mathematician, as we were quickly informed, could wear shorts and be so admired, who was I to complain about the colour of the School shorts! If he couldÂ come all the way from Eastern Nigeria\n(\nas we then thought\n)\n, who was I not to leave home for\n111\nmilesÂ awayÂ and only a\n4\n-hour journey from Lagos! The spirit of adventure ... landed me at the Ibadan Boys' High School in January\n1954\n. ... Under the able leadership of Principal Okonjo, we were made to, and we did, feel equal to the other two boys' secondary schools in Ibadan.\nIn\n1955\nOkonjo went to Germany on a German government scholarship to study at the University of Erlangen-Nurnberg, where he remained until\n1961\n. He was awarded a vor-diplom PrÃ¼fung fÃ¼r Mathematiker\n(\nequivalent to a B.Sc. in mathematics\n)\nin\n1957\n, a Diplom Mathematiker\n(\nequivalent to an M.Sc. in mathematics\n)\nin\n1960\n, and a Diplom Volkswirt\n(\nequivalent to an M.Sc. in economics\n)\nin\n1962\n. He moved to the University of Cologne, Germany in\n1961\nwhere he studied for a doctorate advised by Ewald Burger and Johann Pfanzagl.\nOkonjo was awarded a Dr.rer.nat.\n(\nMathematical Economics and Statistics\n)\nby the University of Cologne in\n1962\nfor his thesis\nÃber stationÃ¤re Null-Eins-Prozesse\nâ\n(\nOn stationary\n0\n-\n1\n-processes\n)\n. Returning to Nigeria, he was appointed as a Lecturer at the University of Ibadan in\n1962\nand promoted to Senior Lecturer two years later. In\n1963\nhe published\nOn the teaching of economics in Nigeria\n. His Abstract reads as follows:-\nAlthough the\n1962\n-\n68\nNational Development Plan recognises the need for trained economists, relatively little thought has been given to the training of the desired economists, the content and mode of their education. In this article the education which the Nigerian would-be economists receive in the universities is examined and the assumptions which underlie their training are critically reviewed.\nIn the paper, Okonjo presents a plan for a four-year economics first degree. His next paper,\nPatterns of population growth\n(1964)\nhas the following Abstract:-\nIt had been hoped that the results of the\n1962\ncensus would be available for analysis and would form the basis of this paper. As the census was annulled, this paper is therefore being presented without the many calculations, using the\n1952\n-\n53\ncensus as a base and the\n1962\ncensus as a signpost, as had been planned. The author has been forced to forego the better insight into the pattern of population growth in this country, which an analysis of the figures from the two censuses might have provided. The article has the following parts: I. A review of thought on population growth through the ages; II. The concepts of growth, population and simple growth; III. Population growth; IV. The logistic curve and the logistic pattern of population growth; V. Patterns arising from a combination of different levels of fertility and mortality; VI. The pattern of Nigerian population growth.\nOn\n1\nOctober\n1960\nNigeria became independent. The country saw increasing unrest, however, which was intensified by elections in\n1964\nwith widespread reports of electoral fraud. A military coup in\n1966\nwas put down but resulted in the army taking over. The Biafran War broke out in July\n1967\n, the coup being a significant factor in the outbreak of war which was fought between government forces and the state of Biafra which was seeking independence motivated by ethnic and religious differences. In\n1967\n, as a result of the civil war, Okonjo moved to the University of Nigeria Nsukka, where he was appointed as a Senior Lecturer. He became a Brigadier in the Biafran Army and Head of the Biafran Organization of Freedom Fighters during the war. The war ended in January\n1970\nwith defeat for the Biafrans. In\n1971\nhe was promoted to Professor of Economics at the University of Nigeria. He continued to hold this position until\n1974\nwhen he began working for the United Nations.\nWe quote from\n[\n17\n]\n, the Press Release issued when Okonjo was the recipient of the Ghana National Award in November\n2016\n:-\nMr Okonjo ... is a renowned mathematician and economist who worked for a long time in Ghana as a United Nations staff and later as a consultant to the Ghanaian Government. He joined the United Nations System in\n1974\nas an official based in New York with his duty station at Accra, Ghana as the Director of the Regional Institute for Population Studies\n(\nRIPS\n)\nat the University of Ghana, Lego, Accra. He worked as a Professor of Economics at the University from\n1974\nto\n1985\nat a time the country was going through severe economic and political difficulties. During that time, Mr Okonjo installed the first African population information network popularly known as the Population Information and Documentation System for Africa valued at $\n350\n,\n000\n. He also created a twelve months Master of Arts\n(\nM.A.\n)\nprogramme, eighteen months Master of Philosophy\n(\nM.Phil.\n)\nand thirty-six months Doctor of Philosophy\n(\nPh.D.\n)\ndegrees in Population Studies at the University. Over\n437\npost graduate students successfully completed their studies under his leadership. Professor Chukwuka Okonjo later left the United Nations in\n1985\nand worked as the Education Adviser to Ghana's Minister of Education and Culture where he was instrumental in conceptualizing and implementing several reforms in the structure and organization of the minister. Some of the reforms include reducing the length of pre-tertiary education from\n17\nto\n12\nyears, increasing secondary school admission from\n26\n,\n000\nto\n260\n,\n000\nand growing primary school enrolment at a rate of\n12\nper cent per annum\n(\ntwice the rate approved by the World Bank for Ghana\n)\n.\nIn the interview\n[\n5\n]\nOkonjo explained that the UN asked the Ghana government to set up the Regional Institute for Population Studies but the government could not afford to do this so the UN agreed to set up the Institute on condition that the Ghana government would take over running it once it generated sufficient funding. Okonjo was asked to run the Institute but the Ghana government did not take over running it. Instead the UN continued to run it as the Department of Population Studies of the University of Ghana, located in the University but run as a United Nations Organisation.\nFor a version of the interview\n[\n5\n]\nsee\nTHIS LINK\n.\nIn\n2000\nOkonjo published\nThe Quiet Revolution. On creating an information-age education system for Nigeria\n. The Preview states:-\nThe author, an experienced demographer, argues that abundant intellectual capital, high educational standards and first class work skills are the key to modernisation, characterised by economic growth with equity and diversity. After a detailed survey of the education system at all levels, he concludes that modernisation can be achieved in Nigeria through the total reconstruction of the education system which includes an increase in the time pupils spend at school, changes in the curriculum, use of teaching aids and development studies.\nFor further information about Okonjo's views see a version of the interview\n[\n5\n]\nat\nTHIS LINK\n.\nOkonjo married Kamene Ofunne and they had seven children. The most famous of these seven children is Ngozi Okonjo\n(\nborn\n13\nJune\n1954)\nwho married the neurosurgeon Ikemba Iweala and is now known as Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala. She is an economist who worked for the World Bank for\n25\nyears, reaching the No\n2\nposition in the bank as the Managing Director, Operations. Her father said\n[\n5\n]\n:-\nIf it wasn't for the politics, she should have been President of the World Bank.\nShe also served two terms as Finance Minister of Nigeria, the first\n2003\n-\n2006\nand the second\n2011\n-\n2015\n.\nIn\n2007\nOkonjo became the Obi of Ogwashi Ukwu. The position of Obi is essentially that of a local king and is an hereditary position. This was disputed by another family who claimed that they had the right to succeed to the position of Obi of Ogwashi Ukwu. In\n[\n7\n]\nthe dispute is summarised:-\n... there has been a protracted kingship tussle over who occupies the throne between the Umudei ruling house represented by Izedunor lineage and the Umuobaha ruling house represented by Okonjo lineage. The state government had presented the staff of office to Chukwuka Okonjo, father of Nigeria's Minister of Finance as the Obi of Ogwashi-Uku Kingdom following his victory at the lower courts. However, Okonjo's victory at the lower courts is being challenged by the Izedunor lineage at the Supreme Court and as such the police advised both parties to maintain the status quo until judgement was delivered.\nOn\n10\nDecember\n2012\nOkonjo's wife Kamene was kidnapped. Kamene Okonjo\n[\n15\n]\n:-\n... the retired\n82\nyear old professor of sociology and Queen mother of the Delta state town of Ogwashi Ukwu, was kidnapped Sunday by\n10\narmed men in her husband's palace when she came out to serve drinks to workers.\nAfter being held for five days, with a ransom demanded for her release, Kamene Okonjo was released. It was not clear whether Okonjo had paid the ransom that had been demanded. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala\n[\n9\n]\n:-\n... told the press that the kidnappers told her mother she had been kidnapped because of the minister's policies concerning oil subsidy payments.\nNgozi Okonjo-Iweala  published the book\nFighting Corruption is Dangerous: The story behind the headlines\n(2018)\nin which she wrote that it:-\n... is not the book I intended to write. But when I sat down with my laptop, what came out was an account of my mother's ordeal at the hand of kidnappers and their demand that, for her to be released, I had to resign my position as Finance Minister and leave Nigeria. I followed this account with notes about my encounters with corruption that is pervasive within a certain segment of Nigerian government and society. It was my husband, Ikemba, who insisted that \"you have to put all this together into something that people can read. You owe it to your mother.\" I am grateful to him for his insistence and his pressure on me to write a few lines every day until the book was done. The book is dedicated to my mother, Kamene Okonjo, and my father Chukwuka Okonjo, because they - especially my mother - are the inspiration and instigation for it. I owe them too much to capture here, but I am grateful to God that they are alive and of sound mind and can read the book.\nOkonjo received the National Service Award in June\n1982\nfor the support he gave to the National Service Scheme of the Ghanaian Government. He received the Ghana National Award in\n2016\n\"in recognition of his contributions to the country's education system.\"\nFinally, let us record that Okonjo gave his hobbies as gardening and dancing.",
