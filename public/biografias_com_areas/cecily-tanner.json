  "biografia": "Rosalind Cecilia Hildegard Tanner\nonly took the name Tanner after her marriage. She was the daughter of the English mathematicians\nWilliam Henry Young\nand\nGrace Emily Chisholm\nwho were studying in GÃ¶ttingen, Germany when she was born. She was given the names\nRosalind Cecilia Hildegard\nYoung\nbut the name on her birth certificate has German versions of her names, appearing as Rosalinde CÃ¤cilie Hildegard Young. In fact she was known as Cecily and, to avoid confusion with other Youngs, we will call her Cecily throughout this biography. In fact her publications appear with the names R C Young, R Cecily Young or Rosalind Cecily Young until he marriage in\n1953\nafter which she published under the name R C Tanner.\nCecily's mother\nGrace Chisholm\nundertook research at GÃ¶ttingen, Germany, advised by\nFelix Klein\nand in\n1895\nshe obtained a Ph.D. for her thesis which applied\nKlein\n's group theory to spherical trigonometry. She sent a copy of her thesis to\nWilliam Henry Young\nwho had been her tutor for a term at Cambridge. By this time her parents were elderly, her father being\n86\nyears old, so she returned from Germany to England to help look after them. On\n11\nJune\n1896\nshe married\nWilliam Henry Young\nwho had studied at Peterhouse, Cambridge, had been fourth\nWrangler\nin the Mathematical Tripos of\n1895\nand had been elected a fellow of Peterhouse in\n1896\n.\nFelix Klein\ncame to Cambridge in\n1897\nto receive an honorary degree and encouraged the Youngs to go the GÃ¶ttingen to undertake research.\nWilliam\nand\nGrace\n's first child Francis\n(\nknown as Frank\n)\nwas born on\n4\nJune\n1897\nin Cambridge and in September the Youngs left Cambridge for GÃ¶ttingen. Grace wrote\n[\n10\n]\n:-\nAt Cambridge the pursuit of pure learning was impossible. ... Everything pointed to examination, everything was judged by examination standard. There was no interchange of ideas, there was no encouragement, there was no generosity.\nAfter a short while in Germany,\nWilliam\n,\nGrace\nand Frank Young left GÃ¶ttingen and travelled in Italy for a year spending some time studying geometry in Turin, then in September\n1899\n, they returned to GÃ¶ttingen where their second child Rosalind Cecilia Hildegard, the subject of this biography, was born in February\n1900\n.\nFelix Klein\n's daughter, Luise Klein\n(1879\n-\n1961)\n, acted as Cecily's unofficial godmother\n(\nLuise could not be her official godmother because she was not a member of the Church of England\n)\n. Four further children were born to the Youngs in GÃ¶ttingen: Janet Dorothea Ernestine Young\n(\nborn\n14\nDecember\n1901)\n, Helen Marian Kinnear Young\n(\nborn\n20\nSeptember\n1903)\n,\nLaurence Chisholm Young\n(\nborn\n14\nJuly\n1904)\n, and Patrick Chisholm Young\n(\nborn\n18\nMarch\n1908)\n.\nLet us give a few details about Cecily Young's siblings. Frank Young, although showing considerable mathematical abilities, was keen to become a pilot. During the First World War he was\n2\nnd Lieutenant, Royal Flying Corps. He was killed in active service on\n14\nFebruary\n1917\n, aged\n20\nyears, when his plane was shot down. Janet Dorothea Ernestine Young became a physician and married Stephen Ernest Michael. She died in London in July\n1997\n. Helen Marian Kinnear Young married Jean M Canu\n(1898\n-\n1989)\nin\n1929\n. She died in Germany in\n1947\n.\nLaurence Chisholm Young\nbecame a mathematician and has a biography in this Archive. Patrick Chisholm Young became a chemist and pursued a career in finance and business. He married Marjorie Sarjent in\n1950\nand died in\n1996\n.\nIn\n1905\nWilliam\nand\nGrace\nYoung published\nFirst book of geometry\n. This book is interesting here because it shows how the Youngs used non-conventional ways of teaching mathematics to Cecily and their other children.\nG H Hardy\nwrites\n[\n9\n]\n:-\nThe book is a genuine 'book for children' of a very interesting and original kind. The central idea is that children should be encouraged to think of geometrical objects in three dimensions, to think of a plane, for example, as a boundary of a solid, and of a line as an intersection of two planes, or as a fold in one. I am no authority on such a matter, but I should have thought that the idea was sound, and that a book based on it should be more concrete and more stimulating, for most learners, than those of the more conventional and abstract pattern. The authors, however, were asking too much of English teachers. It appeared that they could not, or would not, fold paper, and the book fell absolutely flat in England. It was much more successful abroad, has been translated into German, Italian, Magyar and Swedish, and used with success in German schools.\nTwo further children's books authored by\nGrace Young\n, written to introduce Cecily and her other children to science, wereÂ\nBimbo\nÂ\n(1906)\n, andÂ\nBimbo and the Frogs\nÂ\n(1907)\n. We note that 'Bimbo' was the Young's nickname for their eldest child Frank.\nIn\n1908\n, shortly after the birth of Patrick, the large Young family moved to Geneva, Switzerland where their children were educated. Cecily had begun her primary schooling in GÃ¶ttingen before the family moved, but from\n1908\ncontinued her education in Geneva. Much of the time, however,\nWilliam Young\nwas away from home. He returned to Cambridge during term time where he both taught and examined. At various times, in addition to his role as examiner at Cambridge, he was also an examiner to the Central Welsh Board\n(1902\nto\n1905)\n, the University of London, and the University of Wales. In\n1913\nhe accepted two part-time chairs, one being the Hardinge Professorship of Pure Mathematics in Calcutta University which he held from\n1913\nto\n1917\n, the other being the Professorship of Philosophy and the History of Mathematics at the University of Liverpool which he held from\n1913\nto\n1919\n.\nGrace Young\nhad, for the larger part of every year, the responsibility of bringing up the children on her own.\nIn\n1915\nthe family moved to Lausanne where Cecily completed the two final years of her schooling and entered the University of Lausanne in\n1917\n. In\n1919\nher father,\nWilliam Young\n,\n[\n9\n]\n:-\n... was appointed Professor of Pure Mathematics at Aberystwyth. Here he was as energetic as ever, but his residence abroad was sometimes a source of trouble, and disagreements about this, and about appointments to the staff, led to his resignation in\n1923\n.\nThese were four years in which Cecily was studying for her licence at the University of Lausanne but in fact she was in Aberystwyth for much of these four years acting as an unofficial assistant to her father.\nEdward Collingwood\nwas on the staff at Aberystwyth and between\n1921\nand\n1924\nshe helped him translate\nGeorges Valiron\n's French lectures into the book\nLectures on the General Theory of Integral Functions\n. It is worth noting that the Preface to the book was written by\nWilliam Young\nbut nowhere in the book is Cecily Young's help acknowledged. After spending time in Aberystwyth, she returned to full-time study at Lausanne and was awarded her 'Licence Ã¨s sciences\n(\nmathÃ©matique et physique\n)\n' in\n1925\n.\nCecily published her first paper in\n1925\n, namely\nLes fonctions monotones et l'intÃ©gration dans l'espace Ã  n dimensions\nâ\n(\nMonotonic functions and integration in n-dimensional space\n)\nwhich was published in\nL'Enseignement MathÃ©matique\n. In the paper she proves certain facts which were stated in\nWilliam Young\n's paper\nOn multiple integrals\n(1917)\nwithout proof. The paper is written in French and she gives her address as Lausanne.\nAfter completing her degree in Lausanne, Cecily matriculated at Girton College, Cambridge to undertake research for a Ph.D.; her mother,\nGrace Chisholm\n, had been an undergraduate at Girton. Her thesis advisor was\nErnest Hobson\nand she developed some important ideas which, as well as making a very powerful Ph.D. thesis, she published over the following few years. At Cambridge she was close to her brother\nLaurence Chisholm Young\nwho was studying at Trinity College, Cambridge. He was working on writing his first bookÂ\nThe theory of integration\nand Cecily assisted him, typing out the text. The book is an introduction toÂ\nLebesgue\n-\nStieltjes\nintegration using techniques based on monotone sequences of functions and was published by Cambridge University PressÂ inÂ\n1927\n. As well as translating French texts to English, Cecily translated texts from German to English, for example while studying at Cambridge she translated\nKonrad Knopp\n'sÂ\nTheorie und Anwendung der unendlichen Reihen\nâ\n(\nTheory and application of infinite series\n)\nand her translation was published as\nTheory and Application of Infinite Series\nÂ\n(1928)\n. She was awarded a Ph.D. in\n1928\nfor her thesis\nFoundations for the generalisation of the theory of Stieltjes integration and of the theory of length, area and volume. An n-dimensional treatment\n.\nDuring the years\n1928\n-\n32\n, Cecily published a number of papers related to the work of her thesis. The main ones are:\nOn the integral\nâ«\na\nb\nF\n(\nx\n)\nd\nx\nx\nâ\nt\n\\int_a^b \\large\\frac {F(x)dx}{x-t}\nâ«\na\nb\nâ\nx\nâ\nt\nF\n(\nx\n)\nd\nx\nâ\n(1928)\n;\nOn Riemann-Stieltjes integrals with respect to a Riemann integral in space of n dimensions\n(1928)\n;\nThÃ©orÃ¨mes sur les ensembles d'intervalles linÃ©aires au sens gÃ©nÃ©ral, avec application aux fonctions Ã  limites unilatÃ©rales uniques et finies en tout point\nâ\n(\nTheorems on sets of linear intervals in the general sense, with application to functions with unique unilateral limits and finite at any point\n)\n(1928)\n;\nFunctions of\nÎ£\n\\Sigma\nÎ£\ndefined by addition or functions of intervals in n-dimensional formulation\n(1929)\n;\nOn Riemann integration with respect to a continuous increment\n(1929)\n;\nOn \"Riemann\" integration with respect to an additive function of sets\n(1929)\n;\nOn many-valued Riemann-Stieltjes integration\n(1931)\n;\nOn many-valued Riemann-Stieltjes integration, II. Integration of bounded functions with respect to functions of bounded variation\n(1931)\n;\nNon-Uniform Convergence and Term-by-Term Riemann-Stieltjes Integration\n(1931)\n; and\nThe algebra of many-valued quantities\n(1931)\n. Let us illustrate these papers by quoting from some of them.\nCecily begins the paper\nOn Riemann-Stieltjes integrals with respect to a Riemann integral in space of n dimensions\n(1928)\nas follows:-\nJ M Whittaker\nand H J Ettlinger have lately discussed a very special point in the theory of\nRiemann\n-\nStieltjes\nintegration in one dimension, which can, in point of fact, be elucidated in a few lines, and in n-dimensional language, as a corollary to\nW H Young\n's necessary and sufficient condition for\nRiemann\n-\nStieltjes\nintegrability of bounded functions.\nThe following extract is from\nOn Riemann integration with respect to a continuous increment\n(1929)\n:-\nIn a previous communication to the Math. Zeitschrift\n(\nFunctions of\nÎ£\n\\Sigma\nÎ£\ndefined by addition or functions of intervals in n-dimensional formulation\n)\n, I had the opportunity of immediately illustrating the use of the notions there introduced and of some of the results, in the simple considerations relating to \"\nRiemann\n\" integration of continuous functions with respect to continuous increments. This application has an independent interest and may be extended in a similar manner to that in which ordinary\nRiemann\n-\nStieltjes\nintegration of continuous functions is extended. With this extension the present paper is concerned.\n...\nIn section I of the present paper, I discuss the definition of\nRiemann\nintegration with respect to a continuous increment, obtaining at the same time the elementary propositions needed in the sequel, and I examine the connection between this definition and the current definitions of\nRiemann\nintegration with respect to a function of bounded variation. In sections\n2\n-\n5\n, integrability of bounded functions with respect to a non-negative increment is considered, and necessary and sufficient conditions deduced for this case. In sections\n6\n-\n8\n, the restriction that the increment be non-negative is removed, and in section\n9\nthe precise formulation of the criteria of integrability is obtained for the case of an unbounded integrand. The latter discussion reduces Riemann integration of an unbounded function to that of a bounded function equal to it where it lies between certain fixed bounds\n(\ndepending on the integrator\n)\nand zero elsewhere; while the former reduces\nRiemann\nintegration of a bounded function with respect to any continuous increment to-that with respect to non-negative increments. Both these questions I have failed to find explicitly treated in previous literature even in the simple case of ordinary one-dimensional\nRiemann\n-\nStieltjes\nintegration, the step taken in sections\n6\n-\n8\nhaving indeed been slurred over by previous writers.\nFinally, we quote from\nOn \"Riemann\" integration with respect to an additive function of sets\n(1929)\n:-\nIn the present note I consider nominally seta of points of the field of\nBorel\nsets in space of n dimensions. The only idea, however, special to this type of set, actually involved is that of the distance between two elements\n(\npoints\n)\n, on which is based that of the span of a set, of the norm of a subdivision, as well as that of point of accumulation of a set and the consequent ideas of closed and open sets relatively to a containing set. The characteristic notions of product, sum, difference, limits of sets are not geometrical, and are common to all types of sets. The fields of sets considered may be restricted if desired, provided that we maintain the possibility of forming subdivisions of arbitrarily small norm of every set; of finding subsets of arbitrarily small span containing any element of any given set; and of proceeding to the limit of any sequence of sets, without leaving the field.\nIn the paper\nThe algebra of many-valued quantities\n(1931)\n, Cecily came up with ideas that were independently rediscovered over\n20\nyears later\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nThe idea of considering whole sets of numbers instead of particular numbers and using them in computation is not new in mathematics and appears in a relatively modern form with studies of Young\n(1931)\nwho used sets of limits of a given function in case the limit was not unique. Young considered intervals and other sets of numbers and defined generalisations of arithmetic operations and relations on them. For instance, she defined the sum\n[\na\n1\n,\na\n2\n]\n+\n[\nb\n1\n,\nb\n2\n]\n[a_1, a_2] + [b_1, b_2]\n[\na\n1\nâ\n,\na\n2\nâ\n]\n+\n[\nb\n1\nâ\n,\nb\n2\nâ\n]\nas the set of all numbers\na\n+\nb\na+b\na\n+\nb\nwhere\na\nâ\n[\na\n1\n,\na\n2\n]\na \\in [a_{1}, a_{2}]\na\nâ\n[\na\n1\nâ\n,\na\n2\nâ\n]\nand\nb\nâ\n[\nb\n1\n,\nb\n2\n]\nb \\in [b_{1}, b_{2}]\nb\nâ\n[\nb\n1\nâ\n,\nb\n2\nâ\n]\n. These rules later reappear in the context of interval analysis, which emerged in the\n1950\ns in connection with analysis of errors in computations on digital computers independently in the works of Dwyer, Warmus, Dunaga, and Moore, who referred to Dwyer's book. The basic arithmetic operations for intervals introduced by Young are reinvented in these works.\nDuring the time Cecily was writing these papers she held a fellowship at Girton College. Her fellowship ended in\n1932\nand for a year she was unable to find another position. She had hopes of a position at the University of Michigan in the United States but, despite support from\nNorbert Wiener\nwith whom she had written the joint paper\nThe total variation of\ng\n(\nx\n+\nh\n)\nâ\ng\n(\nx\ng(x+h) - g(x\ng\n(\nx\n+\nh\n)\nâ\ng\n(\nx\n)\n(1933)\n, she was unsuccessful. In\n1933\n, however, she was appointed at the Imperial College of Science and Technology, University of London, where she spent the rest of her career. Her last publications on topics close to her thesis were two more papers in\n1936\n. After this she became interested in the history of mathematics and in mathematical education.\nCecily attended several of the International Mathematical Congresses. She was at the\n1932\nCongress in Zurich, the\n1950\nCongress in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and the\n1958\nCongress in Edinburgh, Scotland. At the\n1958\nCongress she delivered the Short Address 'Equal and unequal'; none of the Short Addresses were published. By the time she attended the\n1958\nCongress, Cecily was R C H Tanner, for she had married Bernard William Tanner\n(1881\n-\n1954)\nin the Holy Trinity Church in Wallington, Surrey on\n3\nSeptember\n1953\n. Bernard Tanner, who was\n72\nyears old, had been an electrical engineer and the chief maintenance engineer at Imperial College, London. Their marriage only lasted nine months since Bernard Tanner died on\n12\nJune\n1954\nat The War Memorial Hospital Carshalton, Surrey.\nWe mentioned that Cecily became interested in the history of mathematics but she had a particular passion to make the work of\nThomas Harriot\nbetter known. Her paper\nOn the role of equality and inequality in the history of mathematics\nwas published in\n1962\n, see\n[\n12\n]\n. The paper begins:-\nThe following essay is adapted from one with the same title read to the British Society for the History of Science on\n20\nOctober\n1945\n- the anniversary, by a striking coincidence, of the birth of\nW H Young\n(1863\n-\n1942)\n. To his memory I dedicated the talk, and now rededicate its publication, not only because I am his daughter and of all that means, but because he invented a method, the method of monotone sequences, which shows the powerfulness of inequalities as a mathematical tool supremely. In\n1631\n, twenty-five years after Shakespeare died, eleven years before\nNewton\nwas born, Walter Warner, mathematician and philosopher, gave out in print the Algebra of\nThomas Harriot\n, his 'Artis Analyticae Praxis ad Aequationes resolvendas\nâ\n(\nAnalytical practice for resolving equations\n)\n'. This is the work in which our modern inequality signs are used for the first time in their modern sense, the left-hand pointing arrow-head  <  to mean 'is less than', the right-hand pointing arrow-head  >  to mean 'is greater than'. Today these signs are indispensable to the mathematician. To us it appears obvious that here was one of the happiest conceits in the history of mathematical thinking.\nIt was the study of inequalities that made Cecily enthusiastic about making\nThomas Harriot\n's contributions better known. She financed the\nThomas Harriot\nSeminar in Oxford,\nHarriot\n's home town, which began in\n1967\n. It ran until\n1983\nand contributed much to bringing\nHarriot\nto the fore and putting his work in context. She wrote a number of papers on\nHarriot\n, we mention in particular:\nThe study of Thomas Harriot's manuscripts\n(1967)\n;\nThomas Harriot as mathematician: A legacy of hearsay\n(1967)\n;\nThomas Harriot\n(1560\n?-\n1621)\n(1969)\n;\nHenry Stevens and the associates of Thomas Harriot\n((1974)\n;\nNathaniel Torporley's 'Congestor analyticus'  and Thomas Harriot's 'De triangulus laterum rationalum\nâ\n(\nOn a triangle with rational sides\n)\n(1977)\n;\nThe ordered regiment of the minus sign: Off-beat mathematics in Harriot's manuscripts\n(1980)\n; and\nThe alien realm of the minus: Deviatory mathematics in Cardano's writings\n(1980)\n.\nBernhard Neumann\nwrites about her interests other than mathematics and her health problems in\n[\n11\n]\n:-\nFrom childhood she suffered from impaired hearing, which became more severe over the years and restricted her contacts outside her family, though she learned to lip-read and had many friends, especially among fellow mathematicians. She was a talented violinist, wrote poetry, and was intermittently a churchgoing Christian. She donated generously to a number of organisations, especially those concerned with her historical interests, at Oxford, Durham, and Cambridge. She died in the Mayday Hospital, Croydon, from bronchopneumonia, acute myeloid leukaemia, and congestive heart failure on\n24\nNovember\n1992\n, and was cremated in Croydon.\nWe now give two quotes by Cecily. The first is from a letter she wrote to her parents giving insight into the relation between them\n[\n13\n]\n:-\nAnother famous partnership, that of George Eliot and Lewes, can be taken as in many respects the counterpart of that of my parents. There it was the man who took the brunt of life off the woman's shoulders and spent his creative energies in fostering her genius. This my mother clearly appreciated.\nWhen all is said, it remains that my father had ideas and a wide grasp of subjects, but was by nature undecided; his mind worked only when stimulated by the reactions of a sympathetic audience. My mother had decision and initiative and the stamina to carry an undertaking to its conclusion. Her skill in understanding and responding, and her pleasure in exercising this skill led her naturally to the position she filled so uniquely. If she had not that skill, my father's genius would probably have been abortive, and would not have eclipsed hers and the name she had already made for herself.\nFinally, let us quote her views on mathematics and the British\n[\n12\n]\n:-\nWe are supposed to be a non-mathematical nation, just as we were once regarded as a non-musical nation. I have a theory that the opposite is true. Inequality is so deeply part of mathematics that it is taken for granted and one hardly thinks of pointing out that it had to be given a symbol in order to become safe and simple to use. Our mathematics also is so deeply assimilated that it is taken for granted. We don't see the fun of simplification and systematisation until the less fundamentally mathematical-minded insist on it. That is why the decimal system leaves the majority of us cold. It seems to me that this sort of antithesis has always stood between us and Continental mathematics, and is the chief obstacle\nHarriot\nencountered too, and of course\nNewton\n.",
