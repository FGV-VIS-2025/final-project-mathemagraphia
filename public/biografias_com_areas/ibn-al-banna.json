  "biografia": "Ibn al-Banna\nis also known as Abu'l-Abbas Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Uthman al-Azdi. It is a little unclear whether al-Banna was born in the city of Marrakesh or whether it was the region of Marrakesh which was named Morocco by Europeans. There is a claim that al-Banna was born in Granada in Spain and moved to North Africa for his education. What is certain is that he spent most of his life in Morocco.\nThe Marinids tribe were allies of the Umayyad caliphs of CÃ³rdoba. The tribe lived in eastern Morocco then, under their ruler Abu Yahya, they began to conquer the region. The Marinids captured Fez in\n1248\nand made it their capital. They captured Marrakesh from the ruling Almohads tribe in\n1269\n, thus taking control of the whole of Morocco. Having conquered Morocco, the Marinids tried to help Granada to prevent the Christian advance through their country. The strong link between Granada and Morocco may account for the confusion as to which country al-Banna was a native.\nMorocco was certainly the country that al-Banna was educated in, learning the leading mathematical skills of the period. He studied geometry in general, and\nEuclid\n's\nElements\nin particular. He also studied fractional numbers and learnt much of the impressive contributions that the Arabs had made to mathematics over the preceding\n400\nyears. The Marinids had a strong culture for learning and Fez became their centre of learning. At the university in Fez Al-Banna taught all branches of mathematics, which at this time included arithmetic, algebra, geometry and astronomy. Fez was a thriving city with a new quarter being built housing the Royal Palace and the adjoining Great Mosque. Many students studied under al-Banna in this thriving academic community.\nIt is clear that al-Banna wrote a large number of works, in fact\n82\nare listed by Renaud\n(\nsee for example\n[\n9\n]\n)\n. Not all are on mathematics, but the mathematical texts included an introduction to\nEuclid\n's\nElements\n, an algebra text and various works on astronomy. One difficulty with the works on mathematics is knowing how much of the material which al-Banna presents is original and how much is simply his version of work by earlier Arab mathematicians which has been lost. We should certainly say that al-Banna does not claim any originality and, indeed, the style of his writing would suggest that he is collecting together ideas that he has learnt from other mathematicians.\nTwo \"firsts\" for al-Banna are that he seems to have been the first to consider a fraction as a ratio between two numbers\n(\nsee\n[\n12\n]\nfor more details\n)\nand he is the first to use the expression almanakc\n(\nin Arabic al-manakh meaning weather\n)\nin a work containing astronomical and meteorological data.\nPerhaps al-Banna's most famous work is\nTalkhis amal al-hisab\n(\nSummary of arithmetical operations\n)\nand the\nRaf al-Hijab\nwhich is al-Banna's own commentary on the\nTalkhis amal al-hisab\n. It is in this work that al-Banna introduces some mathematical notation which has led certain authors to believe that algebraic symbolism was first developed in Islam by ibn al-Banna and\nal-Qalasadi\n(\nsee for example\n[\n6\n]\n)\n. We refer the reader to the biography of\nal-Qalasadi\nwhere we present arguments to show that neither al-Banna nor\nal-Qalasadi\nwere the inventors of mathematical notation.\nThere are, however, many interesting mathematical ideas and results which appear in the\nRaf al-Hijab\n. For example it contains\ncontinued fractions\nand they are used to compute approximate square roots. Other interesting results on summing series are the results\n1\n3\n+\n3\n3\n+\n5\n3\n+\n.\n.\n.\n+\n(\n2\nn\nâ\n1\n)\n3\n=\nn\n2\n(\n2\nn\n2\nâ\n1\n)\n1^{3} + 3^{3} + 5^{3} + ... + (2n-1)^{3} = n^{2}(2n^{2} - 1)\n1\n3\n+\n3\n3\n+\n5\n3\n+\n.\n.\n.\n+\n(\n2\nn\nâ\n1\n)\n3\n=\nn\n2\n(\n2\nn\n2\nâ\n1\n)\nand\n1\n2\n+\n3\n2\n+\n5\n2\n+\n.\n.\n.\n+\n(\n2\nn\nâ\n1\n)\n2\n=\n1\n6\n(\n2\nn\n+\n1\n)\n2\nn\n(\n2\nn\nâ\n1\n)\n1^{2} + 3^{2} + 5^{2} + ... + (2n-1)^{2} = \\large\\frac{1}{6}\\normalsize (2n + 1)2n(2n - 1)\n1\n2\n+\n3\n2\n+\n5\n2\n+\n.\n.\n.\n+\n(\n2\nn\nâ\n1\n)\n2\n=\n6\n1\nâ\n(\n2\nn\n+\n1\n)\n2\nn\n(\n2\nn\nâ\n1\n)\n.\nPerhaps the most interesting of all is the work on\nbinomial coefficients\nwhich is described in detail in\n[\n2\n]\nand\n[\n3\n]\n. If we denote the binomial coefficient\np\np\np\nchoose\nk\nk\nk\nby\np\nC\nk\n_{p}C_{k}\np\nâ\nC\nk\nâ\nthen al-Banna shows that\np\nC\n2\n=\n1\n2\np\n(\np\nâ\n1\n)\n_{p}C_{2} =  \\large\\frac{1}{2}\\normalsize p(p-1)\np\nâ\nC\n2\nâ\n=\n2\n1\nâ\np\n(\np\nâ\n1\n)\nand then that\np\nC\n3\n=\n1\n3\np\nC\n2\n(\np\nâ\n2\n)\n_{p}C_{3} =  \\large\\frac{1}{3}\\normalsize _{p}C_{2}(p-2)\np\nâ\nC\n3\nâ\n=\n3\n1\nâ\np\nâ\nC\n2\nâ\n(\np\nâ\n2\n)\n.\nHe writes\n(\nsee for example\n[\n2\n]\nor\n[\n3\n]\n)\n:-\n... the ternary combination is thus obtained by multiplying the third of the third term preceding the given number; and so we always multiply the combination that precedes the combination sought by the number that precedes the given number, and whose distance to it is equal to the number of combinations sought. From the product, we take the part that names the number of combinations.\nAlthough this is a little difficult to interpret, what al-Banna is stating here is that\np\nC\nk\n=\np\nC\nk\nâ\n1\n1\nk\n(\np\nâ\n(\nk\nâ\n1\n)\n)\n_{p}C_{k} =  _{p}C_{k-1}\\large\\frac{1}{k}\\normalsize (p - (k - 1) )\np\nâ\nC\nk\nâ\n=\np\nâ\nC\nk\nâ\n1\nâ\nk\n1\nâ\n(\np\nâ\n(\nk\nâ\n1\n)\n)\n.\nHe then goes on to give the familiar\n(\nto us\n)\nresult\np\nC\nk\n=\n1\nk\n!\np\n(\np\nâ\n1\n)\n(\np\nâ\n2\n)\n.\n.\n.\n(\np\nâ\nk\n+\n1\n)\n_{p}C_{k} = \\large\\frac{1}{k!}\\normalsize  p(p - 1)(p - 2)...(p - k + 1)\np\nâ\nC\nk\nâ\n=\nk\n!\n1\nâ\np\n(\np\nâ\n1\n)\n(\np\nâ\n2\n)\n.\n.\n.\n(\np\nâ\nk\n+\n1\n)\nAs Rashed points out in\n[\n2\n]\n, this is only a small step from the\nPascal triangle\nresults given three hundred years earlier by\nal-Karaji\n, then still one hundred years before al-Banna by\nal-Samawal\n. However Rashed writes:-\n... in our opinion, there is something more fundamental than\n[\nthe Pascal triangle\n]\nresults; it is precisely the combinatorial appearance of ibn al-Banna's exposition, together with the relation he partially establishes between\npolygonal numbers\nand\ncombinations\n. It concern, in the first place,\ntriangular numbers\nand combinations of\np\np\np\nobjects in twos, and then polygonal numbers of order\n4\nand combinations of\np\np\np\nobjects in threes.",
