  "biografia": "Jakob Kulik\n's first name is, in addition to the common form Jakob, sometimes written as Jacob or Yakov. When he was born in Lviv, the city was known as Lemberg and was part of the Austrian Empire. Today the city is in Ukraine. Although Lviv was in the Austrian Empire, the inhabitants were largely Polish speaking and, indeed, Kulik's family considered themselves Polish. He attended the Philosophy Faculty of Lviv University and, after graduating, began to study law at the university. However, he soon lost interest in law as he became more and more fascinated by mathematics. He never completed his law degree.\nIn\n1814\na competition was announced for the position of professor of elementary mathematics at the Lyceum in Olomouc\n(\nthe German name for the town is OlmÃ¼tz\n)\n. Kulik entered the competition and was judged the best applicant, worthy of a professorship. He accepted the position and, while teaching in Olomouc, he undertook research towards a doctorate. While still undertaking research for his doctorate, he moved from Olomouc to Graz in\n1816\nwhen he was appointed Professor of Physics and Applied Mathematics at the Lyceum there. In the following year of\n1817\nhe took on additional duties, teaching astronomy at the Joanneum in Graz. He received his doctorate in\n1822\nfor a thesis which studied the rainbow, then, from\n1826\n, he was Professor of Higher Mathematics at the Charles University of Prague. In November\n1848\n, the year of revolution when many students joined in an insurrection, the library of the University of Lviv was destroyed by fire. Kulik donated over\n1000\nbooks to help rebuild the collection at the University in the town of his birth where he had studied. He remained in Prague until his death in\n1863\n. He was buried in the Vysehrad Cemetery in that city.\nKulik wrote textbooks on mathematics and mechanics, for example publishing\nLehrbuch der hÃ¶heren Analysis\nâ\n(\nTextbook of higher analysis\n)\n(1\nst\nedition\n1831\n,\n2\nnd\nedition\n1844)\nand\nAnfangsgrÃ¼nde der hÃ¶heren mechanik\nin\n1846\n. He also published his thousand-year calendar\nDer tausendjÃ¤hrige Kalender\nâ\n(\nThe millennial calendar\n)\nin\n1831\n(\nwith a\n2\nnd\nedition\n1834)\n. The calendar claims to be:-\n... a useful handbook for historians, archivists, judges, lawyers, country clergymen, and even for those who wish to determine chronological data occurring in old manuscripts, history books, and documents.\nKulik is best known, however, for producing numerous mathematical tables including an unpublished table of divisors of integers consisting of\n4212\npages. His first publication of mathematical tables was\nHandbuch mathematischer\nâ\n(\nHandbook of mathematics\n)\n(1824)\n. The contents are described by\nRaymond Archibald\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nIn the 'Handbuch' are\n30\ntables including the following:\n1\n-\n2\n: All factors of numbers up to\n21500\nand the smallest factors up to\n67100\n.\n3\n-\n4\n: Squares and cubes of numbers up to\n1000\nand higher powers of numbers up to\n100\n.\nÂ Â\n5\n: Square roots and cube roots of numbers up to\n1000\n.\n15\n,\n19\n: Natural and logarithmic sin and tan.\n16\n: Natural secants.\n28\n:\n11\n-place log of prime numbers up to\n1811\n.\nClearly Kulik intended this as part of a larger work which was never completed\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nIn the \"Vorerinnerung,\" dated November,\n1823\n, Kulik states that his 'Tafeln' are an extract from a larger work, to be published in the year\n1824\n, and entitled 'Collectio tabularum mathematico-physicarum locupletissima, vollstÃ¤ndige Sammlung mathematisch-physicalischer Tafeln'\nâ\n(\nComplete collection of physical-mathematical tables\n)\n. Among various volumes of tables which Kulik wrote I do not find that this one is ever mentioned, not even in the bibliography sent by Kulik to Poggendorff\n(1863)\nnearly\n40\nyears later.\nPerhaps some of the tables which Kulik intended for this larger publication were contained in his next volume which was published in\n1825\n, namely\nDivisores numerorum decies centena millia non excedentium. Accedunt tabulae auxiliares ad calculandos numeri cujuscunque divisores destinatae. Tafeln der einfachen Faktoren aller Zahlen unter Einer Million nebst HÃ¼lfstafeln zur Bestimmung der Factoren jeder grÃ¶sseren Zahl\nâ\n(\nTables of simple factors of all numbers under one million. In addition methods to determine the factors of any greater number\n)\n. Unlike the earlier work, the tables presented here are all related to primes and factors. He continued to work on producing various tables, some of which he did not publish until many years after he had begun the work. The next tables he published were: conversion tables\nToasirtafeln, zur leichtern Berechnung des LÃ¤ngen- FlÃ¤chenund Kubik-Inhaltes und der verschiedenen MÃ¼nz- Mass- und Gewichts-BetrÃ¤ge\nâ\n(\nTables to facilitate calculation of length, area, cubic content and various coin and weight amounts\n)\n(1833)\n; a table of squares and cubes\nTafeln der Quadrat- und Kubik-Zahlen aller natÃ¼rlichen Zahlen bis hundert Tausend, nebst ihrer Anwendung auf die Zerlegung grosser Zahlen in ihre Faktoren\nâ\n(\nTables of square and cube numbers of all natural numbers to a hundred thousand. In addition, application to the decomposition of large numbers into their factors\n)\n(1848)\n; multiplication tables\nNeue Multiplikationstafeln: ein unentbehrliches HÃ¼lfsmittel fÃ¼r Jedermann, um schnell, sicher und ohne ErmÃ¼dung zu rechnen\nâ\n(\nNew multiplication tables: an indispensable expedients for everyone to count quickly, safely and without fatigue\n)\n(1851)\n; and tables of hyperbolic sectors and elliptic arcs\nTafeln der hyperbolischen Sektoren und der LÃ¤ngen elliptischer BÃ¶gen und Quadranten\nâ\n(\nTables of hyperbolic sectors and the lengths of elliptical arcs and quadrants\n)\n(1851)\n.\nKulik's most impressive work, however, if one is just thinking about the sheer magnitude of the task, was his unpublished tables of factors. He did publish a description of the unpublished tables in\n1860\nand, in\n1866\n,\nJÃ³zeph Petzval\nalso described Kulik's tables. In\n[\n4\n]\nHoward Eves states that Kulik's greatest achievement was the construction of these factor tables:-\nHis as yet unpublished manuscript is the result of a twenty-year hobby, and covers all numbers up to\n100\n,\n000\n,\n000\n.\nSimilar statements are made in many other books, see for example\nLeonard Dickson\n's comments in\n[\n3\n]\n. Kulik's manuscripts are kept in the archives of the\nAustrian Academy of Sciences\n(\nKaiserliche Akademie der Wissenschaften in Wien\n)\nin Vienna, and Novy has studied them and has written\n[\n6\n]\nand\n[\n7\n]\nto correct false statements about them such as the one by Eves above. Novy gives the following summary of his article\n[\n6\n]\n:-\nThe manuscript tables of J P Kulik\n(1793\n-\n1863)\n, kept in the Archives of the\nAustrian Academy of Sciences\nof Vienna, are commonly alleged to give the least divisors of all numbers up to\n100\nmillion. The incorrectness of this assertion is demonstrated by an analysis of the manuscript materials including the unknown auxiliary computations made by Kulik. In the paper it is shown that the computations are incomplete, and that the least divisors of only certain numbers are entered in the tables, starting at the\n23\nrd\nmillion. In comparison with the preserved part of the tables\n(\nthe tables from\n13\n,\n000\n,\n000\nto\n23\n,\n000\n,\n000\nare lost\n)\n, the auxiliary computations reaching in a complete succession up to\n20\nmillion may be of greater value, although diminishingly so going up to\n80\nmillion. A description of Kulik's methods of computation is also given, and documents are referred to which substantiate the hypothesis that Kulik was helped in his work by collaborators. Meanwhile, we also give the basic dates for the rest of the tables\n(\nespecially of trigonometric functions\n)\ndeposited in Kulik's Nachlass in Vienna.\nNovy is even more direct in his criticisms of the unpublished tables in\n[\n7\n]\n:-\n... the manuscript of Kulik's tables of divisors is essentially useless beginning with the third volume; the second volume, which has been lost, could perhaps tell us more about the real value of the manuscript.\nKulik's methods of calculating his tables and other manuscripts left by him are, however, very interesting and are discussed in\n[\n7\n]\n. Other work by Kulik which we have not mentioned above includes:\nTheorie und Tafeln der Kettenlinie\nâ\n(\nTheory and tables for the catenary\n)\n(1832)\n;\nUntersuchungen Ã¼ber die KettenbrÃ¼ckenlinie\nâ\n(\nStudies of the cables of the Chain Bridge\n)\n(1838)\n; and\nÃber die Tafel primitiver Wurzeln\nâ\n(\nTables of primitive roots\n)\nâ\n(\nOn the layout of primitive roots\n)\n(1853)\n.\nThe\nUnion of Czech Mathematicians and Physicists\nbegan its existence on\n28\nMay\n1862\nwhen the Society for Open Lectures in Mathematics and Physics in Prague was founded. Initially it was a student Society for students at the Charles University of Prague, but university teachers quickly supported the Society. In particular Kulik gave strong support and in the year after the Society was founded he donated a large part of his extensive library of mathematics books to the Society. When he died the rest of his library was left to the Society.\nLet us end this biography by quoting the mathematician FrantiÅ¡ek Josef Studnicka\n(1836\n-\n1903)\n, a colleague of Kulik's at the Charles University of Prague, who wrote of Kulik's death\n(\nsee\n[\n10\n]\n)\n:-\nHe stopped calculating and living.",
