  "biografia": "Johann\n(\nII\n)\nBernoulli\nwas one of three sons of\nJohann Bernoulli\n. In fact he was the most successful of the three. He originally studied law and in\n1727\nhe obtained the degree of doctor of jurisprudence.\nYou can see the Bernoulli family tree at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nHe worked on mathematics both with his father and as an independent worker. He had the remarkable distinction of winning the Prize of the\nParis Academy\non no less than four separate occasions. On the strength of this he was appointed to his father's chair in Basel when\nJohann Bernoulli\ndied.\nHowever, quoting\n[\n1\n]\n:-\n... thereafter his mathematical production dwindled to occasional academic papers and a treatise, although he lived to almost as old as his father. His shyness and frail constitution did not, however, prevent him from engaging in extensive scientific correspondence\n(\nabout\n900\nitems\n)\nand from furthering the publication, in four volumes, of his father's Opera Omnia. He personified the mathematical genius of his native city in the second half of the eighteenth century.\nJohann\n(\nII\n)\nBernoulli worked mainly on heat and light.\nMaupertuis\n, who was President of the\nBerlin Academy\n, was accused by\nSamuel KÃ¶nig\nof plagiarising\nLeibniz\n's work. Voltaire was so critical of\nMaupertuis\n' work that eventually he left Berlin and, in\n1756\n, travelled to Basel where he took refuge in Johann\n(\nII\n)\nBernoulli home.\nMaupertuis\nremained in Johann's home for the last three years of his life.",
