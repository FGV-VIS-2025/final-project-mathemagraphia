  "biografia": "Proclus\n's father, Particius, and his mother, Marcella, were citizens of high social position in Lycia. Particius was a senior law official in the courts at Byzantium. Proclus was brought up at Xanthus, on the south coast of Lycia, where he attended school.\nIt was intended that Proclus should follow his father and enter the legal profession. With this aim in mind he was sent to Alexandria but, while in the middle of his studies, he visited Byzantium and he became convinced that his calling in life was the study of philosophy. He returned to Alexandria where now he studied philosophy under Olympiodorus the Elder, in particular making a deep study of the works of\nAristotle\n. He also learnt mathematics in Alexandria and in this subject his teacher was Heron\n(\nnot the famous mathematician, Heron was a common name at this time\n)\n.\nProclus was not entirely satisfied with the education he was receiving in philosophy in Alexandria so, while still a teenager, he moved from Alexandria to Athens where he studied at\nPlato's Academy\nunder the philosophers Plutarch of Athens and\nSyrianus\n(\na pupil of Plutarch\n)\n. He progressed from being a student at the\nAcademy\nto teaching there then, on the death of Syrianus, Proclus became head of the\nAcademy\n. The title Diadochus was given to him at this time, the meaning of the word being successor.\nAt the\nAcademy\nProclus appears to have been well off and to have helped his friends and relations financially. He never married and lived a life which was, in certain respects, not unlike that proposed by\nPythagoras\n. He did not eat meat and tried to live a religious life, composing hymns to the gods. His hymns were clearly highly thought of since seven of them have been preserved and are seen today as having considerable literary merit. Proclus was to remain as head of the\nAcademy\nuntil his death.\nA man of great learning, Proclus was regarded with great veneration by his contemporaries. He followed the\nneoplatonist\nphilosophy which\nPlotinus\nfounded, and\nPorphyry\nand\nIamblichus\ndeveloped around\n300\nAD. Other developers of these ideas were Plutarch and Syrianus, the teachers of Proclus.\nHeath\nwrites\n[\n4\n]\n:-\nHe was an acute\ndialectician\nand pre-eminent among his contemporaries in the range of his learning; he was a competent mathematician; he was even a poet. At the same time he was a believer in all sorts of myths and mysteries, and a devout worshipper of divinities both Greek and Oriental. He was much more a philosopher than a mathematician.\nOf course, as one might expect, his belief in many religious sayings meant that he was highly biased in his views on many issues of science. For example he mentions the hypothesis that the sun is at the centre of the planets as proposed by\nAristarchus\nbut rejects it immediately since it contradicted the views of a Chaldean whom he says that it is unlawful not to believe.\nProclus wrote\nCommentary on Euclid\nwhich is our principal source about the early history of Greek geometry. The book is certainly the product of his teaching at the\nAcademy\n. This work is not coloured by his religious beliefs and Martin, writing in the middle of the\n19\nth\ncentury, says\n(\nsee for example\n[\n4\n]\n)\n:-\n... for Proclus the \"Elements of Euclid\" had the good fortune not to be contradicted either by the Chaldean Oracles or by the speculations of Pythagoreans old and new.\nProclus had access to books which are now lost and others, already lost in Proclus's time, were described based on extracts in other books available to Proclus. In particular he certainly used the\nHistory of Geometry\nby\nEudemus\n, which is now lost, as is the works of\nGeminus\nwhich he also used.\nHeath\n, describing Proclus's\nCommentary on Euclid\nwrites\n[\n4\n]\n:-\nProclus deals historically and critically with all the definitions, postulates and axioms in order. The notes on the postulates and axioms are preceded by a general discussion of the principles of geometry, hypotheses, postulates and axioms, and their relation to one another; here as usual Proclus quotes the opinions of all the important authorities.\nAnother interesting part of Proclus's commentary is his discussion of the critics of geometry. He writes:-\n... it is against\n[\nthe principles of geometry\n]\nthat most critics of geometry have raised objections, endeavouring to show that these parts are not firmly established. Of those in this group whose arguments have become notorious some, such as the\nSceptics\n, would do away with all knowledge ... whereas others, like the\nEpicureans\n, propose only to discredit the principles of geometry. Another group of critics, however, admit the principles but deny that the propositions coming after the principles can be demonstrated unless they grant something that is not contained in the principles. This method of controversy was followed by\nZeno of Sidon\n, who belonged to the school of\nEpicurus\nand against whom\nPosidonius\nhas written a whole book and shown that his views are thoroughly unsound.\nMorrow in\n[\n1\n]\nconfirms the great debt that we owe to Proclus, and in particular his\nCommentary on Euclid\nwhen he writes in\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nProclus was not a creative mathematician; but he was an acute expositor and critic, with a thorough grasp of mathematical method and a detailed knowledge of the thousand years of Greek mathematics from\nThales\nto his own time.\nThe recent book\n[\n7\n]\ngives a good description of the writings of Proclus found in his commentary on Book I of\nEuclid\n's\nElements\n. The book\n[\n7\n]\nis an important contribution to the study of the philosophy of Proclus and in particular his philosophy of mathematics.\nProclus also wrote\nHypotyposis\n, an introduction to the astronomical theories of\nHipparchus\nand\nPtolemy\nin which he described the mathematical theory of the planets based on\nepicycles\nand on\neccentrics\n. He combined his geometrical skills and his knowledge of astronomy to give a geometrical proof that the epicycle theory for the planets is equivalent to the eccentric theory. In the epicycle theory the Earth is in the centre of a circle which has smaller circles rotating round its circumference. In the eccentric theory the planets move round in circles whose centres do not coincide with the Earth.\nNothing here is original and Proclus is proving results first given by\nHipparchus\nand\nPtolemy\n. However, although Proclus believed that this theory should be studied by his students at the\nAcademy\n, he was not uncritical, suggesting that the theory was overly complicated and also that it was an ad hoc theory with no reason to explain its various parts.\nIn his astronomical writings, Proclus described how the water clock invented by\nHeron\ncould be used to measure the apparent diameter of the Sun. Proclus's method can be used at the\nequinox\n. Water is collected from the clock in a container while the sun rises. As soon as the Sun has risen the water is collected in another container and this measurement continues until sunrise the following day. Then the ratio of the weights of water in the two containers gives the apparent diameter of the Sun.\nAmong Proclus's many works are\nLiber de causis\n(\nBook of Causes\n)\n,\nInstitutio theologica\n(\nElements of Theology\n)\n, a concise exposition of\nmetaphysics\n,\nElements of Physics\n, largely giving\nAristotle\n's views, and\nIn Platonis theologiam\n(\nPlatonic Theology\n)\ngiving\nPlato\n's metaphysics. His contribution is well summarised in\n[\n1\n]\nas follows:-\nProclus deserves to be remembered ... for the qualities he possessed that are exceedingly rare in any age and were almost unique in his: the logical clarity and firmness of his thought, the acuteness of his analyses, his eagerness to understand and readiness to present the views of his predecessors on controversial issues, the sustained coherence of his lengthy expositions, and the large horizon, as broad as the whole of being, within which his thinking moved.",
