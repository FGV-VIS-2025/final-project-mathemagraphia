  "biografia": "Leopold Klug\n's name is also written\nLipÃ³t Klug\n; the first version being German while the second version is Hungarian. His parents were Miksa Klug and Hani Neufeld; the family was Jewish. He attended the\ngymnasium\nin his hometown and entered the University of Budapest in\n1872\n. After he graduated from the University on\n16\nJuly\n1874\nwith a teaching diploma, he was appointed on\n25\nSeptember as a high school teacher in the Science High School in Pozsony\n(\nBratislava\n)\n. He taught there between\n1874\nand\n1893\n, writing his first books on geometry, after which he taught at a secondary school in Budapest. During these years he undertook research, first for his diploma which was awarded in\n1882\n, then for his\nhabilitation\n. He also taught as a\nprivatdocent\nin Synthetic Geometry at the University of Budapest from\n1891\n. During these years, he was greatly influenced by\nGyula KÃ¶nig\nwho taught at the Technical University of Budapest from the early\n1870\ns. After the award of his habilitation, Klug was appointed to the Joseph Franz University of KolozsvÃ¡r\n(\nnow Cluj\n)\nas an extraordinary professor in Descriptive Geometry. After two years he was appointed to the chair of Descriptive Geometry at the University of KolozsvÃ¡r, a position he held for nearly twenty years, until\n1917\n, when he retired and moved back to Budapest.\nSoon after he retired, Klug wrote to\nLeopold FejÃ©r\nand the letter contains interesting information about Klug's family\n(\nsee\n[\n2\n]\n)\n:-\nI'm telling you what you already know, that I retired, and that my daughter obtained the Music Teacher's Diploma. She's learning her eighth language, namely Turkish, because she has been reading novels and epic poems in Spanish and Russian for a long time.\nHe spent his years in retirement continuing to undertake scientific work and publishing the fruits of his efforts; it is no accident that the Technical University of Vienna keeps a whole box containing his works. However, his eyes must have troubled him for he wrote in a letter in April\n1918\n(\nsee\n[\n2\n]\n)\n:-\nI don't intend to write more because my eyes have became weak because of the reading and writing I've done in all these years. Now I'm not allowed to tire them with geometry work.\nDuring his retirement, he put in much effort encouraging young talents such as Ferenc KÃ¡rteszi\n(1907\n-\n1989)\nand Edward Teller\n(1908\n-\n2003)\n, the 'father of the hydrogen bomb'. Back in Budapest after his retirement, Klug lived on Kertesz Street,\n38\n, I/\n4\n, in the\n7\nth\nDistrict of Budapest; the Tellers also lived there. We quote from an interview by Teller in which he talks of the influence that Klug had on him:-\nWhen I was ten years old, my father, who had really no understanding of how and why I would be interested\n[\nin mathematics\n]\n, did see that I was. And he had an older friend who was a retired mathematics professor. His name was Leopold Klug. And he is probably the man who had the greatest influence on my life. I did not see him often, half a dozen times, a dozen times. He was a retired mathematics professor, and he did two things. One is, he got me a book. The title was 'Algebra', the author was\nLeonhard Euler\n. ... It was a very elementary book, starting from questions why to add, and why to multiply, and why minus one times minus one is plus one. All the way up to the solving of fourth order algebraic equations. The fifth order had not been solved at that time. And at the time of\nEuler\n, it was not known that the equations above the fourth order cannot be solved. That was shown much later, by a very young Frenchman,\nÃvariste Galois\n. Klug gave me that book, and I read it. It was my favourite book.\nKlug had a favourite subject, and that was projective geometry. Projective plane geometry. What happens if you take a drawing in a plane, and project it on another plane. What are the properties that remain unchanged? For instance, a line will remain a line. A triangle will remain a triangle. But an equilateral triangle will not remain an equilateral triangle. A circle may become a hyperbola. What is the similarity between these curves? What remains unchanged? I was ten years old, and the problems that came up were too difficult for me to solve, but not too difficult to understand. And there was a human element in it which impressed me.\nI found that the grown-ups had a terrible time, everybody got tired of what they were doing. Klug was the first grown-up who I met who loved what he was doing, who did not get tired, and who even enjoyed explaining things to me. That I think is when I made up my mind, very firmly, that I wanted to do something that I really did want to do. Not for anyone else's sake, not for what it may lead to, but because of my inherent interest in the subject.\nKlug died in Budapest towards the end of\n1944\nbut the circumstances of his death have been unclear up to now. In\n1944\n, with the Red Army and the Romanian Army approaching Budapest, the ninety-year-old mathematician walked out of his home in Budapest and he never came back. Probably he was the victim of a racially motivated attack.\nBarna SzÃ©nÃ¡ssy\n[\n1\n]\nsums up Klug's mathematical contributions:-\nAt the beginning of his activity spanning more than fifty years, LipÃ³t Klug turned to problems studied by Gyula VÃ¡lyi, consistently ignoring analytic methods. Later he studies more diverse fields with success.\nWe should now look at the Klug Foundation which he set up at the University of KolozsvÃ¡r\n(\nCluj\n)\nwith money which he saved from his pension during the years of his retirement in Budapest.  In August\n1942\n, two years before Klug died, the following report appeared in the\nHungarian Jewish Journal\n[\n3\n]\n:-\nProf Dr Leopold Klug\nIn the Hungarian Scientific circles it has been enthusiastically discussed for weeks that Prof Dr Leopold Klug, internationally recognized mathematician, has set up a foundation of ten thousand  Hungarian pengÃ¶ at the University of KolozsvÃ¡r\n(\nCluj\n)\n, where he was ordinary public teacher before the Romanian occupation.\nThe news proved to be true. The offer of the substantial foundation really has taken place. The Council of the University of KolozsvÃ¡r\n(\nCluj\n)\naccepted with thanks the gesture of patronage from the Jewish scientist. The Ministry of Religion and Education approved the constitution of the foundation.\nFrom the foundation of Leopold Klug - according to our information - the first aim will be to reward those students who have undertaken excellent work in the seminar in the field of Descriptive Geometry. The second aim will be to reward those who show extraordinary interest and special talent in Geometry. This subject was Dr Leopold Klug's favourite.\nDr Leopold Klug, the new patron of a university foundation, was born in GyÃ¶ngyÃ¶s in\n1854\n, as a child of a Jewish family; in\n1891\nhe became a privatdocent in synthetic geometry at the University of Budapest, and in\n1897\nhe became an extraordinary professor at the University of KolozsvÃ¡r\n(\nCluj\n)\n. In\n1900\nhe became ordinary professor at the University of KolozsvÃ¡r\n(\nCluj\n)\n. He published his work entitled \"The Elements of the Projective Geometry\" with the support of the\nHungarian Academy of Sciences\n. Several of his works were published in German by the Akademie der Wissenschaften in Wien\n(\nAustrian Academy of Sciences\n)\n.\nHis students became the future generations of mathematicians. His work is comparable maybe only to that of Dr L\neopold FejÃ©r\n, who also pursued his first scientific research at the old University of KolozsvÃ¡r\n(\nCluj\n)\n.\nDr Leopold Klug, at the age of a patriarch, living permanently in Budapest but spending each summer in the emergent KolozsvÃ¡r\n(\nCluj\n)\n, now wishes to serve Hungarian science by financially supporting the first steps of talented mathematicians and geometers at his former place of employment.\nThe first winner of the Leopold Klug Prize was Ferenc ZigÃ¡ny in\n1943\n. He was awarded the prize because of his report reviewing the scientific contributions made by Leopold Klug. Here is a short quote from ZigÃ¡ny's report\n(\nsee\n[\n2\n]\n)\n:-\nWith time things change, and scientific research is no exception. Its diverse problems are sometimes in vogue, but sometimes pushed into the background giving space for new ones. While in the past two centuries geometers chose their themes from the field of Projective Geometry, particularly from the domain of second degree curves and surfaces, interest in this topic has significantly decreased nowadays. Leopold Klug was an enthusiast for the flourishing of Projective Geometry, and within that, the synthetic method which inspired many great minds in the past. As big as the love was with which he promoted projective geometry based on the synthetical method, equally big was the bitterness after he realized the decrease of interest in it.\nThe highlight of his work is represented by two textbooks: 'The Elements of Projective Geometry' and 'Projective Geometry'\n(1903)\n. The first describes the problems in the plane while the second extends the study to problems in\n3\n-dimensional space. A very interesting and more extensively worked out detail of the first book is the different projectivities and involutions, and the relations of some of these\n(\nfor example, the adjuncteds\n)\n, as well as the conic with double tangential point. Both of these topics were Klug's favourites and several of his dissertations deal with them. A beautiful detail from of the second book is the part concerning the polaric tetraeder in the chapter entitled 'Hyperboloid', and in the chapter entitled 'The Third Order Space Curve'. The relation of this curve to the\n0\nsystem and the components of the hyperboloid intersecting the curve are studied. In the third place there is his textbook entitled 'Descriptive Geometry', a work written with an excellent pedagogical sense and with a great choice of material, then the fourth one: 'A Synthetic Discussion of Third-Order Space Curves'\n(1881)\n.\nBesides these textbooks a large number of his articles enrich our geometry literature.\nWe should note that Leopold Klug Prize was only awarded in\n1943\n. The prize was divided between Ferenc ZigÃ¡ny and LÃ¡szlÃ³ Fejes\n(\nTÃ³th\n)\nfor his successful geometrical research."
