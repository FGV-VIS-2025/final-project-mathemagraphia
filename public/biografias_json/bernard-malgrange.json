  "biografia": "Bernard Malgrange\n's father was an engineer while his mother's family also contained engineers and men who had studied at the Ãcole Polytechnique. Bernard grew up in Paris, living in the family home on the Rue de Rennes near the Luxembourg gardens. He was the eldest of his parents' eight children and he received his early education at a private school. Then he entered the eighth class of the LycÃ©e Montaigne, close to the Luxembourg gardens, before entering the LycÃ©e Louis Le Grand to prepare for university studies. Of course his school years were difficult ones, for he was only eleven years old when World War II began on\n1\nSeptember\n1939\n, the day when German forces entered Poland. On the following day, Britain, France and several other countries, declared war on Germany but over the following months France was not involved in any fighting, but spent time trying to build defences to protect the country from an invasion by Germany. The war changed dramatically for France on\n10\nMay\n1940\nwhen the German army crossed the Dutch and Belgium borders and soon German armies approached Paris. At this stage Malgrange's family moved to the provinces where he continued his education. He did not show particular strengths in mathematics at this provincial college. He said\n[\n6\n]\n:-\nCompared to the class, I was not terribly bright and there was a girl in my class who was very strong competition.\nHis father was held as a prisoner for a time, but when the family were able to return to Paris and he entered the LycÃ©e there, he found himself to be the best pupil in the class. After taking the baccalaureate examinations, he intended to train as an engineer and follow in his father's footsteps. However, his teacher suggested that he should take the entrance examination for the Ãcole Normale SupÃ©rieure. This was not the route that his family had envisioned since the Ãcole Normale SupÃ©rieure was essentially the place where teachers were trained and there was no tradition of teachers in either his father or his mother's families. It had more demanding entrance requirements that the Ãcole Polytechnique which would have been a much more natural choice for anyone wishing to train to become an engineer. Malgrange's father certainly would have preferred his son to attend the Ãcole Polytechnique.\nEven after the decision had been taken that, because of his outstanding performance, he would enter the Ãcole Normale SupÃ©rieure, he still had to choose between mathematics and physics. Although at first he thought that physics might be the more useful option, he had found that he did not have a great deal of dexterity for physics experiments at school and frequently broke the apparatus he was using. He also realised that the quality of mathematics teaching was superior to that of physics so in the end he opted for mathematics. In his first year at the Ãcole Normale SupÃ©rieure he was greatly helped by\nJean-Pierre Serre\nwho was two years ahead of him. In his second year of study he was taught by\nHenri Cartan\nwho had arrived back from a visit to Chicago and Harvard in the United States. Malgrange took\nCartan\n's courses on\ndifferential geometry\nand\nLie\ngroups in his second year. Following a suggestion by\nJean DieudonnÃ©\n, enthusiastically supported by\nHenri Cartan\n, Malgrange and his fellow student AndrÃ© Blanchard spent one semester of their second year of study at the Faculty of Sciences at Nancy. There they were taught by\nLaurent Schwartz\n,\nJean DieudonnÃ©\n,\nJean Delsarte\nand\nRoger Godement\n.\nSchwartz\nwrote\n[\n7\n]\n:-\nIt was a pleasure to receive in our university, which at that time had no research students, two young brilliant students from the Ãcole Normale SupÃ©rieure. It was a breath of fresh air. We had, at Nancy, an active seminar every Saturday in which all the professors and some of our students participated, which studied a variety of different topics. Malgrange and Blanchard were two active participants.\nAmong the topics at these seminars that Malgrange attended we mention differential topology, particularly\nde Rham\n's theorem. In his fourth year of study at the Ãcole Normale SupÃ©rieure, Malgrange took a course on functions of several complex variables from\nHenri Cartan\nand also attended a seminar led by\nJean-Pierre Serre\non the same topic. In\n1951\nMalgrange was awarded a grant by the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique to undertake research at Nancy advised by\nLaurent Schwartz\n. At Nancy he was one of three students studying for their doctorates with\nSchwartz\n.\nJacques-Louis Lions\nhad, like Malgrange, been a student at the Ãcole Normale SupÃ©rieure, while the other student,\nAlexander Grothendieck\n, had been an undergraduate at Montpellier.\nPaulo Ribenboim\narrived from Brazil to work in Nancy at about the same time as\nGrothendieck\n.\nLaurent Schwartz\nwrites\n[\n7\n]\n:-\nSo we had a very important group of young men to whom we gave our full attention. I think that, for some years, the Faculty of Science at Nancy was one of the major mathematical centres in the world for everything related to analysis.\nIn\n1952\nSchwartz\nwas appointed as a professor in Paris and his students went to Paris with him to complete their doctorates. An interesting story relating to\nGrothendieck\n's thesis was told by Malgrange, who was present at the thesis defence on\n28\nFebruary\n1953\n. He:-\n... recalled that after\nGrothendieck\nwrote his thesis he asserted that he was no longer interested in topological vector spaces. \"He told me, 'There is nothing more to do, the subject is dead',\" Malgrange recalled. At that time, students were required to prepare a \"second thesis\", which did not contain original work but which was intended to demonstrate depth of understanding of another area of mathematics far removed from the thesis topic.\nGrothendieck\n's second thesis was on sheaf theory, and this work may have planted the seeds for his interest in\nalgebraic geometry\n, where he was to do his greatest work. After\nGrothendieck\n's thesis defense, which took place in Paris, Malgrange recalled that he,\nGrothendieck\n, and\nHenri Cartan\npiled into a taxicab to go to lunch at the home of\nLaurent Schwartz\n. They took a cab because Malgrange had broken his leg skiing. \"In the taxi\nCartan\nexplained to\nGrothendieck\nsome wrong things\nGrothendieck\nhad said about sheaf theory,\" Malgrange recalled.\nA difficulty arose with Malgrange's thesis which is explained in detail by\nSchwartz\nin\n[\n7\n]\n:-\nThe idea of finding an elementary solution for all differential operators with constant coefficients might seem a bit far fetched. However, I had made the suggestion of the existence of such a solution using the theory of distributions. But I had no idea if this suggestion was sensible. Malgrange has precisely demonstrated this existence theorem at about the same time as LÃ©on Ehrenpreis in the United States. Ehrenpreis, moreover, put me in an embarrassing situation. Malgrange and Ehrenpreis worked for several years on very similar topics. They had both published notes and were preparing their theses. I worked very closely with Malgrange, but also with Ehrenpreis who regularly sent me material for reflection and told me his plans. But it was hardly possible for me to compare two students preparing their doctoral theses. If I received a letter from Ehrenpreis giving me some suggestions, did I have the right to tell Malgrange? This blurred the whole situation. Sometimes one, sometimes the other, was the more advanced, and I could not keep a balance. Although it is a profoundly anti-scientific principle, I asked Ehrenpreis not to write letters to me about his plans. He could send me notes of papers to be published once they were completely ready, as both of the two sent published notes to each other, he could decide himself whether he wanted to publish or not to publish. He understood this situation which was unpleasant for him and for me, and I'm grateful. He has also done remarkable work on similar topics.\nMalgrange was awarded his doctorate in\n1955\nfrom the UniversitÃ©\nHenri PoincarÃ©\nat Nancy for his thesis\nExistence et approximation des solutions des Ã©quations aux dÃ©rivÃ©es partielles et des Ã©quations de convolution\nâ\n(\nExistence and approximation of solutions of partial differential equations and convolution equations\n)\n. This work was based on ideas in the theory of distributions developed by\nLaurent Schwartz\nand also used ideas on analytic functions which had been developed by\nHenri Cartan\n. Even before his thesis was published, Malgrange had published a number of papers. These were the two-part paper\nÃquations aux dÃ©rivÃ©es partielles Ã  coeficients constants\nâ\n(\nPartial differential equations with constant coeficients\n)\n(1953\n,\n1954)\n, and the papers\nSur quelque propriÃ©tÃ©s des Ã©quations de convolution\nâ\n(\nOn some properties of convolution equations\n)\n(1954)\nand\nFormes harmonique sur un espace de Riemann Ã\nd\ns\n2\nds^{2}\nd\ns\n2\nanalytique\nâ\n(\nHarmonic forms on a Riemann space ds\n2\n-analytic\n)\n(1955)\n. These were all published in\nComptes Rendu\nof the\nAcademy of Sciences\n. Malgrange was appointed as an assistant lecturer in the Faculty of Sciences at Strasbourg in\n1955\nand later promoted to Professeur sans chaire.  He was invited to lecture at the Tata Institute in Bombay and his lectures were written up as the book\nLectures on the theory of functions of several complex variables\n(1958)\n. The book was republished in\n1984\n. In\n1960\nhe returned to Paris where he was appointed as an assistant lecturer in the Faculty of Sciences. He was given a personal chair on\n1\nJanuary\n1962\n.\nIn\n1965\nMalgrange became a professor in the Faculty of Science at Orsay. The University of Paris, the Ãcole Normale SupÃ©rieure and the CollÃ¨ge de France had set up a site at Orsay, in the south west suburbs of Paris, after World War II. It became a faculty in its own right on\n1\nMarch\n1965\nbut it was a small department that Malgrange joined. It soon became a large centre and\n[\n3\n]\n:-\n... we spent half of the year discussing recruitment, and the other half solving administrative problems.\nIn order to have a quieter time where he could devote more time to mathematics, he accepted the position of professor in the Faculty of Science at Grenoble in\n1969\n. In\n1971\nthe Faculty of Science at Grenoble changed its name to become the UniversitÃ© scientifique et mÃ©dicale de Grenoble. Malgrange remained there until\n1973\nwhen he was appointed Director of Research at the Centre national de la recherche scientifique.\nWe have mentioned his important work on linear partial differential equations above, but he has made numerous other very significant contributions to differential geometry, non-linear differential equations, and singularities of functions and mappings. In particular, he has studied hypoelliptic operators, ideals of differentiable functions, the classification of differential equations with regular singular points, and the algebraic theory of partial differential equations with variable coefficients. Perhaps his best known result is called the Malgrange Preparation Theorem and this appeared in his classic text\nIdeals of differentiable functions\n(1966)\n.\nMichael Atiyah\nwrites:-\nThis book gives a concise and complete account of a number of central theorems concerning differentiable functions. ... The\nWeierstrass\npreparation theorem for differentiable functions, in its various forms, is proved in Chapter V; this result, conjectured by\nRenÃ© Thom\nand proved by the author, is one of the important theorems of the book.\nThis book was based on a course of lectures given by Malgrange at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Bombay, India in January and February\n1964\n.\nIn\n1991\nMalgrange published\nÃquations diffÃ©rentielles Ã  coefficients polynomiaux\nâ\n(\nDifferential equations with polynomial coefficients\n)\n. Luis NarvÃ¡ez Macarro writes in a review:-\nThe modern algebraic theory of differential systems, or \"theory of D-modules'', brings us new relations between two mathematical areas traditionally far apart: the theory of systems of linear partial differential equations and algebraic geometry. The first benefited from the geometric point of view and the algebraic treatment of singularities. The second has seen it endowed with new structures, which explain some depth relations between discrete and continuous cohomological theories of varieties\n(\nRiemann\n-\nHilbert\ncorrespondence\n)\n. In the book under review, the author shows how to fully incorporate some new elements of classical analysis and mathematical physics to the theory of D-modules, especially the Laplace and stationary phase methods. The use of \"sophisticated'' tools, with respect to the traditional methods in classical analysis, such as sheaf theory and derived categories, allows us to understand many exceptional phenomena of the classical theory.\nMalgrange published\nSystÃ¨mes diffÃ©rentiels involutifs\nâ\n(\nInvolutive differential systems\n)\nin\n2005\n. It is a\n106\n-page work which contains the first modern presentation of the theory of involutive differential systems. In\n2007\n, in collaboration with\nPierre Deligne\nand Jean-Pierre Ramis, he published\nSingularitÃ©s irrÃ©guliÃ¨res\nâ\n(\nIrregular singularities\n)\n. Jan Stevens writes:-\nThis book documents the development of the theory of linear differential equations with irregular singularities in the interaction between\nDeligne\n, Malgrange and Ramis. It contains correspondence and previously unpublished manuscripts, mostly from the period\n1976\nto\n1991\n, with comments from the authors and references for further reading.\nMalgrange has received many honours. On\n24\nOctober\n1977\nhe was elected a Corresponding Member of the\nAcademy of Sciences\nand, on\n13\nJune\n1988\n, he became a full member. The\nAcademy of Sciences\nhas awarded Malgrange a number of prizes: the Prix CarriÃ¨re in\n1961\n, the Prix Servant in\n1970\nand the Prix Cognacq-Jay in\n1972\n. He has also been awarded the Prix Peccot-Vimont from the CollÃ¨ge de France in\n1962\nand delivered the prestigious series of lectures on his research there in that year, the Cours Peccot. He also received the Prix AndrÃ© Vera in\n1962\nand the Prix du Rayonnement FranÃ§ais in\n1987\n. The University of Geneva awarded him an honorary degree in\n1978\n."
