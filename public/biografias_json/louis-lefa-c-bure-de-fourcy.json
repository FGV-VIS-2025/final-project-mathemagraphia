  "biografia": "Louis LefÃ©bure de Fourcy\nwas born in Port-au-Prince, a city laid out by the French in\n1749\nwhen it was named L'HÃ´pital. In\n1770\nit became the capital of the French colony of Saint-Domingue. His father, Ãtienne-Louis Lefebvre, called himself Lefebvre du Coudray but, when he married in Saint-Domingue, it was under the name Ãtienne-Louis Lefebvre de Fourcy. The French colony of Saint-Domingue was, by the middle of the\n18\nth\ncentury, the most prosperous of France's possessions. Its wealth came from plantation agriculture and it was in this business that Ãtienne-Louis worked. The environmental damage caused by clearing trees for plantations led to marked drops in productivity and this, together with political problems from a growing independence movement, meant that Ãtienne-Louis had hit hard times by the time his son was born. His son was given the name Louis LefÃ©bure de Fourcy and this version appears on surviving baptismal records. The child only spent the first couple of years of his life in Saint-Domingue for, by\n1789\n, his mother had brought him to France. His father remained in Saint-Domingue where rebellions against French rule broke out in\n1891\n. Ãtienne-Louis Lefebvre died in Saint-Domingue in\n1794\n.\nLouis LefÃ©bure de Fourcy spent his childhood in Nantes but was sent to Paris to complete his education at the CollÃ¨ge de la Marine et des Colonies. From there he won a scholarship to study at the Ãcole Polytechnique which he entered in\n1803\nat the age of sixteen. Among those who entered in the same year, we mention\nFranÃ§ois Arago\n,\nCharles-Julien Brianchon\nand\nClaude-Louis Mathieu\n. These were the early years of the Ãcole Polytechnique during which it operated out of buildings attached to the Palais Bourbon, where the French parliament met. The three years that LefÃ©bure de Fourcy spent at the Ãcole Polytechnique were, of course, years during which France was in the grip of the French Revolution. One consequence of this was that LefÃ©bure, as we shall name him for the remainder of this biography, dropped the aristocratic \"de Fourcy\" in his name. Rather more surprising, however, is that he registered under his father's name so during his studies he was known as Ãtienne-Louis Lefebvre. France had adopted the revolutionary calendar so LefÃ©bure and his fellow students studied for eight and a half days in each\n10\nday week at the Ãcole Polytechnique. Ivor Grattan-Guinness writes\n[\n3\n]\n:-\nThe dominant role of mathematics soon led the students to deploy the catchword 'X' as a name for the school.\nNote that Roland Brasseur refers to the Ãcole Polytechnique as X throughout the article\n[\n2\n]\n. LefÃ©bure graduated from the Ãcole Polytechnique in\n1805\nand enrolled in the Ãcole d'artillerie in Metz. However, he left almost immediately and was appointed to the Pont-Levoy College in Loir-et-Cher. His circumstances had changed in January\n1806\nwhich may have been the reason for the change in his plans. After the death of his father in\n1794\n, his mother had remarried and had two sons before separating from her new husband. She died in January\n1806\nand this left LefÃ©bure responsible for bringing up his two half-brothers. By May\n1807\nhe was back in Paris at the Ãcole Polytechnique where he was appointed as an assistant rÃ©pÃ©titeur in analysis. Things had changed since he was a student. Napoleon Bonapart was now emperor of France and he had given the Ãcole Polytechnique a more military look. It had also moved from the buildings it had occupied when LefÃ©bure was a student, to occupy two colleges not far from the PanthÃ©on. He was awarded a doctorate in\n1811\nafter submitting two theses. One, on mechanics,\nÃquations gÃ©nÃ©rales du mouvement des fluides et application de ces Ã©quations Ã  la thÃ©orie du son\nâ\n(\nGeneral equations of fluid motion and application of these equations to the theory of sound\n)\nconsisted of five pages, while the second, on astronomy,\nDe l'attraction des sphÃ©roÃ¯des et de la figure des planÃ¨tes\nâ\n(\nOn the attraction of spheroids and the shape of planets\n)\n, contained eleven pages. He dedicated these works to\nSylvestre Lacroix\nwho must have acted as an advisor.\nHe became a rÃ©pÃ©titeur in analysis in\n1813\nand in applied analysis in the following year. Around this time there were major changes in France with the defeat of Napoleon in\n1814\nand the restoration of the monarchy. As a result of these changes, LefÃ©bure stopped using his father's name and went back to signing himself Louis LefÃ©bure de Fourcy. He became a rÃ©pÃ©titeur in descriptive geometry in\n1815\nand, from\n1817\nto\n1820\n, he was an examiner in descriptive geometry and the 'graphic arts'. In addition to his duties at the Ãcole Polytechnique, LefÃ©bure was appointed to teach mathematics at the College Louis-le-Grand in December\n1814\n. He had married Marie FranÃ§oise Victoire Peyron and they had two sons, Michel-Eugene LefÃ©bure de Fourcy born in November\n1812\nand Charles LefÃ©bure de Fourcy born in\n1815\n. Michel-Eugene became an engineer and married three times. His first wife was Anne Lassale\n(1809\n-\n1844)\n, his second wife Victoire-AnaÃ¯s Mousset\n(1824\n-\n1847)\n, and his third wife being Marie StÃ©phanie LamÃ©\n(1824\n-\n1909)\n,\nGabriel LamÃ©\n's daughter. Charles LefÃ©bure de Fourcy became Inspector General of Roads and Bridges and participated in the building of the Suez Canal. He married Nathalie Hennequin\n(1822\n-\n1903)\n.\nAt Louis-le-Grand, Louis LefÃ©bure de Fourcy was promoted to teach the special class in October\n1817\n. Of the\n21\nstudents in the special class of\n1817\n-\n18\n, one was the poet, novelist, and dramatist, Victor Hugo. Many years later, he spoke about his mathematics teacher:-\nProfessor M Lefebure de Fourcy, lanky with shoulders which incongruously supported a long pockmarked face, had energy and wit. He crossed the class in a stride, giving rapid demonstrations, streaking the table with lines.\nThe special mathematics class was held every afternoon, Monday to Saturday. As to its content, Victor Hugo explained that the course did not have:-\n... a detailed plan, but a list of books by which it is taught, and the authors for the mathematics texts are\nEuler\n,\nLagrange\nand\nLacroix\nin algebra,\nLacroix\nor\nBiot\nfor applications of algebra to geometry,\nMonge\nand\nPoinsot\nfor statics, and\nDelambre\nor\nBiot\nfor astronomy.\nThe Royal College of Saint-Louis was founded in\n1820\nand LefÃ©bure was appointed as professor of mathematics. There he taught the special class and among his pupils we mention in particular\nJoseph Liouville\n. LefÃ©bure taught at the College of Saint-Louis for five years, leaving in December\n1825\nwhen he was appointed as an assistant to\nSylvestre Lacroix\nat the faculty of Science in Paris. This led to his appointment as admissions examiner for the Ãcole Polytechnique in\n1826\n. Ivor Grattan-Guinness explains\n[\n3\n]\n:-\nStudents were chosen by admissions examiners. The country was divided into four regions, and also Paris, and an examiner travelled in a region for some weeks during the summer to interview promising young boys nominated by local families or dignitaries. The examiners and some school officers then met and chose the enrolment for the following autumn.\nThe Ãcole Polytechnique declared that being an admissions examiner was incompatible with teaching, so LefÃ©bure had free time which he devoted to writing student textbooks. He began publishing a series of books in\n1827\nand over the next few years various texts appeared:\nLeÃ§ons de gÃ©omÃ©trie analytique\nâ\n(\nLessons in analytic geometry\n)\n(1827)\n,\nThÃ©ories du plus grand commun diviseur algÃ©brique et de l'Ã©limination entre deux Ã©quations Ã  deux inconnue\nâ\n(\nTheories of the algebraic greatest common divisor  and the elimination between two equations with two unknowns\n)\n(1827)\n,\nTraitÃ© de gÃ©omÃ©trie descriptive\nâ\n(\nTreatise on descriptive geometry\n)\n(2\nvols.\n1829\n-\n1830)\n,\nÃlÃ©ments de trigonomÃ©trie\nâ\n(\nElements of trigonometry\n)\n(1830)\n,\nLeÃ§ons d'algÃ¨bre\nâ\n(\nAlgebra lessons\n)\n(1833)\n.\nThe title page of\nLeÃ§ons de gÃ©omÃ©trie analytique\nâ\n(\nAnalytic geometry lessons\n)\n(1827)\nlists LefÃ©bure as:-\nChevalier de la LÃ©gion-d'Honneur, Examinateur des Aspirans Ã  l'Ãcole Royale Polytechnique, Ã  l'Ãcole SpÃ©ciale Militaire, Ã  l'Ãcole de Marine et Ã  l'Ãcole ForestiÃ¨re.\nâ\n(\nChevalier of the Legion of Honor, Examiner of midshipmen at the Royal Polytechni  School, the Military Academy and the School of Marine and Forestry School.\n)\nThis book contained a version of the lectures that LefÃ©bure had given at the Royal College of Saint-Louis while he occupied the chair of Special Mathematics. The popularity of this book is indicated by the fact that by\n1881\na tenth edition had been produced.\nTraitÃ© de gÃ©omÃ©trie descriptive\nâ\n(\nTreatise on descriptive geometry\n)\nwas essentially translated into English by Thomas Grainger Hall, of King's College, London, when he wrote his book\nThe elements of descriptive geometry\n(1841)\n. In the Preface, Hall explains the position of descriptive geometry:-\nInvented by the genius of\nMonge\n, and pursued with ardour and success by the most eminent French geometricians, it is now taught in almost all universities and in the principal schools of the continent. In England it was unknown, as a branch of instruction, until lectures were given upon it by Mr\nBradley\n, in the Engineering Department of King's College; and the present work has been undertaken to supply the students with a text book, that by it they might the more profitably attend to what they heard in the lecture room: and as an elementary book was necessary for beginners, it has been thought expedient to place before the students, in an English dress, one which has stood the test of experience. The treatise on Descriptive geometry, by Mr LefÃ©bure de Fourcy has, therefore, been selected, and the following pages are, for the most part, translated from it.\nLefÃ©bure's text was very popular and in\n1881\nthe eighth edition of the book was published. By\n1858\na seventh edition of\nÃlÃ©ments de trigonomÃ©trie\nâ\n(\nElements of trigonometry\n)\nwas in print while\nLeÃ§ons d'algÃ¨bre\nâ\n(\nAlgebra lessons\n)\n, much revised over the years, was in its tenth edition in\n1893\n. In the Preface to the original\n1833\nedition of\nLeÃ§ons d'algÃ¨bre\nâ\n(\nAlgebra lessons\n)\n, LefÃ©bure states:-\nIf I had limited the contents to that which is required for admission to the Ãcole Polytechnique, it would have formed a much less extensive volume.\nLefÃ©bure's books are praised by his son in\n[\n1\n]\nas having:-\n... good ordering of materials, elegant methods, and clarity of style.\nHowever, other have criticised them for being \"totally devoid of original ideas.\" It would be tempting to believe that their popularity might have come from the fact that many students trying to gain entry to top education institutions had to be examined by LefÃ©bure. However, the popularity of these texts continued long after LefÃ©bure ceased being an examiner.\nAs an examiner, LefÃ©bure had a reputation which made the candidates extremely fearful. Together with\nLouis Benjamin Francoeur\nand\nJean Nicolas Pierre Hachette\n, LefÃ©bure examined\nÃvariste Galois\nfor his baccalaureate on\n14\nDecember\n1828\n. By two votes to one, the decision of the examiners was that\nGalois\nshould not enter the Ãcole Polytechnique. Most students dreaded being examined by LefÃ©bure and a report by an Inspector from the Paris\nAcademy of Sciences\nlets us see the reason:-\nSeveral times I attended oral examinations by Mr LefÃ©bure de Fourcy and this is my impression. The professor cannot be considered a benevolent reviewer, his voice is harsh, his tone is dismissive, also he questioned in a very firm stiff manner, and showed no mercy for any errors of logic.\nIt was not only with students that LefÃ©bure was severe and demanding, but he behaved in the same way towards his own sons. He prepared his son Michel-Eugene for the entrance examinations of the Ãcole Polytechnique. Michel-Eugene wrote\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nTwice a week, my father brought us together, one of my friends and I, in front of his old blackboard. I dreaded like fire these sessions, sometimes stormy bringing me to tears. If fear is the beginning of wisdom, perhaps that was how I entered the Ãcole Polytechnique at the first examination\n[\nin\n1829]\n.\nIn May\n1843\nLacroix\ndied and, in July of the same year, LefÃ©bure succeeded him in the chair of differential and integral calculus at the Faculty of Science in Paris. He gave up his role of admissions examiner at the Ãcole Polytechnique at this time. However, he did not distinguish himself as a higher education lecturer. A report by an Inspector from the Paris\nAcademy of Sciences\n, written in\n1860\n, states that:-\n... his teaching is of a low standard, and has no originality. The Professor simply repeats what he has learned previously.\n[\nLefÃ©bure, who\n]\nacquired a good reputation in secondary education, is far from successful, however, in higher education.\nIt was around this time that his health began to fail and LefÃ©bure retired from the Faculty of Science in September\n1863\n. His wife died in December of the following year after a painful illness throughout which, his son wrote, LefÃ©bure suffered in silence. He died on\n12\nMarch\n1869\nand his funeral was held three days later at the Church of Saint-Sulphice. At the Montparnasse Cemetery an address was given by\nJoseph Serret\n."
