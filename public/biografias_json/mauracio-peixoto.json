  "biografia": "MaurÃ­cio Peixoto\nwas the son of JosÃ© Carlos de Matos Peixoto\n(1884\n-\n1976)\nand Violeta Rodrigues de Matos. JosÃ© Carlos de Matos Peixoto was professor of Roman Law at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro and from\n1928\nto\n1930\nwas governor of the State of CearÃ¡. He married Noeme CÃ¢mara in\n1914\nand then his second marriage was to Violeta Rodrigues de Matos Peixoto, daughter of journalist and author TibÃºrcio Rodrigues and Elvira Garcia. In\n1930\nan armed Revolution led to the President being deposed and JosÃ© Carlos de Matos Peixoto was deposed as the governor of the State of CearÃ¡. Humiliated by the new regime, he left CearÃ¡ and went with his family of eight children to Rio de Janeiro, where he devoted himself to law and teaching.\nMaurÃ­cio was nine years old when the family moved to Rio de Janeiro in\n1930\nbut in\n1931\nhe was sent back to Fortaleza to complete his primary education. Back in Fortaleza he lived with an aunt until he finished his primary schooling at the end of\n1932\n. Returning to live with his parents and siblings in Rio de Janeiro he began studying at the ColÃ©gio Pedro II in\n1933\n. This college, the third oldest in Brazil founded in\n1837\n, took pupils from the full range of ages. Most of the students belonged to the country's economic and political elite. His performance at the ColÃ©gio Pedro II was poor, however, the result of the primary schooling he had in Fortaleza being of a much lower level than that in Rio de Janeiro, and he failed his examinations. His father decided that his son needed better teaching and employed Nelson Chaves, who was a student at the Escola Nacional de Engenharia. This tutor did an excellent job as Peixoto explained\n[\n12\n]\n:-\nHe was an intelligent young man, with very clear ideas about mathematics. It was a very important event, because it changed my life, in a certain sense. ... and I was blown away by his teaching; at that time I decided that I would study something that involved mathematics.\nWith Chaves' help, Peixoto easily passed the examinations at the ColÃ©gio Pedro II and spent six years at the school. In\n1938\nhe entered the Universidade do Distrito Federal to study mathematics. This university had been founded in Rio de Janeiro only three years before, in\n1935\n, on the initiative of the Secretary of Education, AnÃ­sio Teixeira. This university, with both administrative and pedagogical autonomy, employed professors with a wide range of views, a fact that generated fierce clashes with the Federal Government. The Universidade do Distrito Federal was forced to close in\n1939\nwhen Peixoto had only completed one year of his studies. He explained\n[\n12\n]\n:-\nAs a career as a mathematician did not exist, I went to study the subject in the only place where it was taught, that is, at the School of Engineering.\nIn\n1939\nPeixoto enrolled at the National School of Engineering at the University of Brazil in Rio de Janeiro.\nMarÃ­lia de Magalhaes Chaves\nand\nLeopoldo Nachbin\nwere both his fellow students, all three beginning their studies in the same year. Peixoto said in the interview\n[\n12\n]\n:-\nDuring the five years of the engineering course,\nLeopoldo\nand I were inseparable companions. ...\nMarÃ­lia\n's influence was very strong during these \"golden years\" ... Both\nMarÃ­lia Chaves\nand\nLeopoldo Nachbin\nwere important influences in my becoming a mathematician. This in the sense of trying to live for and by mathematics.\nIn\n1943\nPeixoto graduated with an engineering degree but he never intended to have a career as an engineer. Mathematics was always the subject for him and throughout his engineering course both he and\nNachbin\nstudied advanced mathematics together, often in the municipal library or at the university. Peixoto also attended lectures at the National Faculty of Philosophy at the University of Brazil by Luigi Sobrero and Gabriele Mammana. Luigi Sobrero\n(1909\n-\n1979)\nhad been born in Turin, Italy, and was awarded an engineering degree from the University of Rome in\n1931\nand a mathematics degree two years later. Between\n1939\nand\n1943\nhe was a visiting professor of theoretical physics at Rio de Janeiro. Gabriele Mammana\n(1893\n-\n1942)\nwas also an Italian mathematician who had graduated from Pisa and then became\nMauro Picone\n's assistant at the University of Catania. He taught in Livorno, Cagliari, Catania and Naples before teaching at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro between\n1939\nand\n1942\n. He was an analyst working on differential equations. Peixoto also gave private mathematics lessons throughout his time as an undergraduate.\nOn\n6\nSeptember\n1946\nPeixoto married the mathematician\nMarÃ­lia de Magalhaes Chaves\nin Rio de Janeiro.\nMarÃ­lia\nhad been born in Sant'Ana do Livramento, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil on\n24\nFebruary\n1921\n, to parents Tullio de Saboia Chaves\n(1884\n-\n1971)\n, Professor at the Surgical Medical School at Rio de Janeiro, and Zillah da Costa Magalhaes. MaurÃ­cio and\nMarÃ­lia\nhad two children, Marta Chaves Peixoto\n(\nborn\n31\nMarch\n1949)\nand Ricardo Chaves Peixoto\n(\nborn\n24\nMarch\n1953)\n.\nAfter graduating, Peixoto was an assistant to the professor of Rational Mechanics at the National School of Engineering. He continued to undertake research on mathematics studying differential equations involved in dynamics. He planned to compete for professorships and developed a thesis for this purpose. He began publishing mathematics papers in\n1946\nand published the\n68\n-page book\nSistemas nao holÃ´nomos\nâ\n(\nNon-holonomous Systems\n)\nin\n1947\n. In the same year, he began working at the Mathematics Centre of the FundaÃ§Ã£o GetÃºlio Vargas. This higher education institution had been founded in\n1944\nwith the aim of stimulating development in Brazil. At the Mathematics Centre there were lectures and much discussion between an enthusiastic group of young mathematicians. While at the FundaÃ§Ã£o GetÃºlio Vargas he met several leading mathematicians, for example\nOscar Zariski\n, who came to give lectures. The journal\nSumma Brasiliensis Mathematicae\nwhich began publishing in\n1945\ncame out of discussions at the FundaÃ§Ã£o GetÃºlio Vargas. Peixoto published the paper\nOn the existence of derivative of generalized convex functions\nin that journal in\n1948\n. His\n66\n-page work\nConvexidade das curvas\nâ\n(\nConvexity of curves\n)\nwas also published in\n1948\n.\nEdwin Beckenbach\nwrites in a review:-\n... there is presented a brief discussion of the basic theory of convex functions as developed by\nJensen\nand others, followed by a more extensive treatment of generalised convex functions. The latter development contains contributions which the author himself has made.\nThis work was produced in competition for a professorship in the School of Agronomy. He did not win the professorship but the thesis was accepted and it entitled him to a doctorate given the regulations in force in Brazil at this time.\nMarshall Harvey Stone\nand\nAdrian Albert\n, both from Chicago, came to Rio de Janeiro on a State Department programme and Peixoto, together with his friend\nLeopoldo Nachbin\n, decided to try to obtain a Buenos Aires Convention scholarship to study at Chicago. Both were eventually awarded a scholarship. Peixoto said\n[\n12\n]\n:-\nIt was a State Department grant, which cost us almost daily trips to Ministry of Foreign Affairs for about a year; the aid came from the Buenos Aires Convention, through which the American government gave scholarships to Latin Americans.\nOn\n21\nSeptember\n1949\n, Peixoto was elected to the\nBrazilian Academy of Sciences\n. After the award of the scholarship, Peixoto and his wife travelled to Chicago in\n1949\n. They both attended the International Congress of Mathematicians held in Cambridge Massachusetts from\n30\nAugust to\n6\nSeptember\n1950\n. Peixoto gave the presentation\nNote on uniform continuity\nin the Analysis Section on the morning of Wednesday\n6\nSeptember. On\n18\nSeptember\n1950\nthey flew from New York to Rio de Janeiro but on\n5\nOctober\n1950\nPeixoto returned without his wife on a flight from Rio de Janeiro to New York on his way back to Chicago. In Chicago he undertook research aiming for an American Ph.D. but, before completing his thesis, decided to return to Brazil and apply for a professorship at the University of Brazil. He flew back from New York to Rio de Janeiro on\n7\nJune\n1951\n. He said\n[\n12\n]\n:-\nI never regretted having dropped out of the doctorate, because a professorship at the University of Brazil appeared very infrequently, since it was for life; it was not an opportunity to be wasted.\nHe presented his thesis\nEquaÃ§Ãµes gerais da dinÃ¢mica\nâ\n(\nGeneral dynamics equations\n)\n(1951)\n, in the competition for the Chair of Rational Mechanics at the University of Brazil. He defended this thesis in\n1952\nand was appointed to the chair. Also in\n1952\nthe Institute of Pure and Applied Mathematics\n(\nIMPA\n)\nwas founded by Peixoto and his colleagues\nLeopoldo Nachbin\nand LÃ©lio Gama.\nIn\n1955\n, in the library of the IMPA, Peixoto came across a\n1952\narticle by H F DeBaggis entitled\nDynamical Systems with Stable Structure\n[\n19\n]\n:-\nThe encounter, apparently accidental, followed by the active browsing through it, had launched Peixoto's insightful mathematical intuition. At home, he worked on the article until late hours. Afterwards he also discussed it with his wife\nMarÃ­lia C Peixoto\n, also an engineer, mathematician and his assistant in the Chair of Mechanics. They decided that, in due time, he should prepare a presentation on Structural Stability in the Seminar he directed, which had the participation of\nMarÃ­lia\n, selected students and teaching assistants of the Chair of Mechanics.\nSolomon Lefschetz\nwrote about DeBaggis\n(\nsee\n[\n19\n]\n)\n:-\nFather Henry DeBaggis, an Assistant Professor of Mathematics at Notre Dame and a PhD. under\nKarl Menger\nat Notre Dame also, joined our Project in\n1949\nand was a member for two years\n1949\n-\n51\n. While his thesis was on Hyperbolic Geometry, he had little taste for that subject and wished to change over to Differential Equations. A reading of an appendix in Andronov and Chaikin\n1949\nrecently appeared, awoke his interest in structural stability.\nPeixoto began developing DeBaggis's ideas and wrote to\nLefschetz\nin\n1956\nexplaining the project he had set himself.\nLefschetz\nwas immediately interested and wrote back to Peixoto suggesting he apply for a Research Associate visiting position at Princeton. With support from the Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development, he visited Princeton in\n1957\n-\n58\n. Peixoto wrote\n[\n13\n]\n:-\nLefschetz\noffered me a table in his spacious office and we talked at length about mathematics, mathematicians and everything else under the sun. We became true friends as much as his eminence could allow, and also the fact that, at seventy-three, he was more than twice my age.\nLefschetz\nwas very fond of\nPontryagin\nand told me that at the age of\n14\n,\nPontryagin\nhad lost both his eyes in an accident with a stove.\nLefschetz\nhimself had been in an accident in\n1910\n, aged twenty-six, and had both arms amputated just below the elbows. He then decided to become a mathematician. In fact, before the summer of\n1958\n,\nLefschetz\nhad met\nPontryagin\nonly on a few occasions during a conference in Moscow in the early\n1930\ns. They talked at length about mathematics and\nLefschetz\nwas tremendously impressed. He referred to the young\nPontryagin\nof those days in hyperbolic terms: \"Everything he touched turned to gold.\"\nPeixoto,\nLefschetz\nand\nPontryagin\nwere all at the International Congress of Mathematicians held in Edinburgh, Scotland, from\n14\nAugust to\n21\nAugust\n1958\n. Peixoto delivered the short communication\nOn structural stability\n. In a published version of his talk he writes:-\nIt is only fair to acknowledge here my indebtedness to Professor\nS Lefschetz\n, who followed closely the development of this work, and to Professor\nH Whitney\nfor his kind advice. Both read a first draft of the manuscript and suggested many valuable improvements ...\nPeixoto wrote about meeting\nPontryagin\nat the Congress\n[\n13\n]\n:-\nDuring the International Congress of Mathematicians in Edinburgh in\n1958\n,\nLefschetz\ntook the initiative to arrange a meeting between me and\nPontryagin\nand offered to serve as an English-Russian interpreter. The idea was that I would communicate to\nPontryagin\nthe content of 'On structural stability' that had not yet been published. From my point of view, the meeting was not very productive.\nPontryagin\nwas not interested in the matter ...\nArticles that Peixoto published in\n1959\n,\n1962\nand\n1963\ncontain Peixoto's Theorem. In\n1969\nhe was awarded the Moinho Santista Award by the Bunge Foundation for Peixoto's Theorem: the citation states:-\n... the theorem of Peixoto on the structural stability in two-dimensional varieties inspired the mathematician\nS Smale\nto create the general theory of dynamic systems.\nIn\n[\n13\n]\nPeixoto writes about meeting\nSmale\n:-\nAnother mathematician who believed in structural stability, and who would become the central figure in the qualitative theory of ordinary differential equations, was\nSteve Smale\n. I was introduced to him by\nElon Lima\nat Princeton in the summer of\n1958\nshortly after I returned from Edinburgh. Before that, some time ago, and through\nLima\nhimself, I was already aware that\nSmale\nhad great promise. Later, in evocative notes,\nSmale\nwrote about our meeting at Princeton and describes his reaction upon learning of the results that were supposed to appear in my Annals article: \"Through\nLefschetz\n, Peixoto became interested in structural stability and showed me his own results on structural stability in the disk\n(\nin an article due to appear in the \"Annals of Mathematics,\n1959\n\"\n)\n. I was immediately excited, not only by what he was doing, but by the possibility that, using my experience in Topology, I could extend his work to the n th dimension.\"\nIn\n1986\nPeixoto received the TWAS prize from the\nThird World Science Academy\n. The following citation, which was read on the podium by\nShiing-shen Chern\nat the opening ceremony, was engraved on the medal that was presented to Peixoto by the Pakistani theoretical physicist and a Nobel Prize laureate Abdus Salam, President of the Third World Science Academy:-\nFor his pioneering and fundamental study of the structural stability of dynamical systems, in particular, for proving that flows on surfaces are generally structurally stable.\nIn his acceptance speech, Peixoto said\n[\n13\n]\n:-\nI would like to point out that this work on structural stability was basically carried out in several articles mentioned below, one of which was in collaboration with my first wife\nMarÃ­lia\n[\nStructural Stability in the plane with enlarged boundary conditions\n(1959)]\n, who did not live to see the end of this adventure. However, her influence in those golden days, decisive and already distant, was great.\nLet us return to Peixoto's career. He continued to hold the professorship of Rational Mechanics at the University of Brazil until\n1964\nwhen he accepted an invitation by\nLefschetz\nto a professorship at Brown University in Providence, USA. It may have been the coup by the armed forces in Brazil which happened in April\n1964\nand the following military dictatorship, that was a factor in his decision to leave the country and accept the professorship at Brown University. He continued to hold this position until\n1970\nwhen he returned to the Institute of Pure and Applied Mathematics in Rio de Janeiro. In\n1971\nhe organised the first International Symposium on Dynamical Systems, bringing together world leading experts, held at the University of Bahia,Â Salvador, Brazil from\n26\nJuly to\n14\nAugust. Peixoto edited the conference proceedings and wrote the Preface, see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nIn\n1973\nPeixoto was appointed as a professor at the Institute of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of SÃ£o Paulo. He continued in this post until\n1978\nafter which he returned to the Institute of Pure and Applied Mathematics in Rio de Janeiro. In\n1974\nhe gave an invited\n30\n-minute lecture at the International Congress of Mathematicians held in Vancouver, Canada, fromÂ\n21\nÂ August toÂ\n29\nÂ August. His lecture with title\nOn Bifurcations of Dynamical Systems\nbegins:-\nWe survey here a certain line of developments of bifurcation theory of dynamical systems on a compact differentiable manifold\nM\nn\nM^{n}\nM\nn\n.  The word bifurcation was introduced by\nPoincarÃ©\nin connection with differential equations of celestial mechanics depending on a real parameter\nÎ»\n\\lambda\nÎ»\n. He focused on a certain feature of the equation, say an isolated closed orbit, present for\nÎ»\n=\nÎ»\n0\n\\lambda = \\lambda_{0}\nÎ»\n=\nÎ»\n0\nâ\n. If when\nÎ»\n\\lambda\nÎ»\nvaries past\nÎ»\n0\n\\lambda_{0}\nÎ»\n0\nâ\nthis closed orbit disappears or undergoes a sudden topological change,\nÎ»\n0\n\\lambda_{0}\nÎ»\n0\nâ\nis said to be a bifurcation value; otherwise it is an ordinary value of the parameter. Traditionally bifurcation theory has been developed from this local point of view. After the emergence of the generic theory of dynamical systems via the coming of age of the concept of structural stability it became natural to take a more general  and global approach to bifurcation theory ...\nHe served as President of the\nBrazilian Mathematical Society\n(1975\n-\n1977)\n, President of the National Research Council\n(1979\n-\n1980)\n, and President of the\nBrazilian Academy of Sciences\n(1981\n-\n1991)\n.\nPeixoto's first wife\nMarÃ­lia\ndied in\n1961\nand he married twice more, to the mathematician Maria LÃºcia Alvarenga and to the mathematician AlcilÃ©a Augusto.\nIn\n2010\nPeixoto was\n89\nyears old. In that year Marcelo Viana, the director of the Institute of Pure and Applied Mathematics, wanted to select Peixoto's most important articles and publish them in a book. Peixoto suggested that Viana wait for a few years since he felt the work he was doing at the time should be included. In fact Peixoto published four papers in\n2011\nand his final paper was published in\n2014\n. He died in Rio de Janeiro at the age of\n98\n."
