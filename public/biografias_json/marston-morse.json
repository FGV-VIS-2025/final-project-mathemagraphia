  "biografia": "Marston Morse\n's mother was Ella Phoebe Marston and his father was Howard Calvin Morse. The name \"Marston\" by which he wanted to be known, was therefore his mother's maiden name and not a forename. Howard Morse, Marston's father, was a farmer and a real estate agent. Marston attended Coburn Classical Institute until he was eighteen years old, at which time he entered Colby College in Waterville.\nMorse received his B.A. from Colby College in\n1914\n, gaining distinction, and from there he entered Harvard to undertake research in mathematics. He obtained a Master's Degree from Harvard in\n1915\nthen continued to work there on his doctoral dissertation which was directed by\nG D Birkhoff\n. He was awarded a Ph.D. in\n1917\nfor a thesis entitled\nCertain Types of Geodesic Motion of a Surface of Negative Curvature\n. Morse taught briefly at Harvard before entering military service for the period of World War I. For the duration of the war he served as a private in the U.S. Army in France and for his outstanding work in the Ambulance Corps he was awarded the Croix de Guerre with Silver Star. From\n1919\nto\n1924\nhe was a second lieutenant in the Reserve Coast Artillery Corps but during this time he had renewed his academic career. In fact his wartime service had prevented him publishing his doctoral thesis, and after the war he set about doing so; it appeared in print in\n1921\n.\nHe was\nBenjamin Peirce\nInstructor at Harvard in\n1919\n-\n20\nand he then became an assistant professor at Cornell\n(1920\n-\n1925)\nand Brown University\n(1925\n-\n1926)\n. From\n1926\nuntil\n1935\nhe was at Harvard, serving as assistant professor\n(1926\n-\n28)\n, associate professor\n(1928\n-\n29)\n, and professor from\n1929\nto\n1935\n. He then moved to the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton for the rest of his career until he retired in\n1962\n.\nDuring his time at Cornell, Morse had married CÃ©leste Phelps on\n20\nJune\n1922\n. The marriage produced one son and one daughter but ended in divorce in\n1930\n. At the time of the divorce Morse was a professor at Harvard, and there was a scandal in August\n1932\nwhen CÃ©leste Phelps married\nOsgood\n, a colleague of Morse's at Harvard. Osgood was\n28\nyears older than Morse, and he was\n68\nyears old at the time of the marriage. These events came as a great shock to Morse, and the scandal led to\nOsgood\nretiring. In\n1940\nMorse married Louise Jeffreys, this marriage producing three daughters and two sons.\nMorse developed variational theory in the large with applications to equilibrium problems in mathematical physics. This is now called Morse theory and it grew out of a major discovery which Morse made not long after returning to mathematics after the war and published in his important paper\nRelations between the critical points of a real function of\nn\nn\nn\nindependent variables\nin\n1925\n. Morse theory is important in the field of global analysis which is the study of ordinary and\npartial differential equations\nfrom a global or topological point of view. It builds on the classical results in the calculus developed by\nHilbert\nand his students. Cooper writes in\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nHe will have enduring fame as the creator of this subject.\nMorse's major works include\nCalculus of variations in the large\n(1934)\n,\nFunctional\ntopology\nand abstract variational theory\n(1938)\n,\nTopological methods in the theory of functions of a complex variable\n(1947)\nand\nLectures on analysis in the large\n(1947)\n.\nWhat distinguishes Morse from many other famous mathematicians is his single-minded persistence with a single theme throughout his life. However this theme, Morse theory, is perhaps the single greatest contribution of American mathematics. It was certainly not his only contribution, however, for in all he wrote about\n180\npapers and eight books on a whole range of topics. These include papers on minimal surfaces, some on the theory of functions of a complex variable where he was particularly interested in applying topological methods, papers on\ndifferential topology\nand on dynamics.\nIt is slightly surprising that the topics which most captivated Morse do not show up as such in this list, although in many ways they were still the motivation behind much of his work. From the time he undertook research as a postgraduate with\nBirkhoff\nhe was directed to the major problems which had interested\nPoincarÃ©\nsuch as the three body problem. He also wanted to produce a topological version of quantum theory, but this largely remained a dream which he never achieved.\nAfter his appointment to the Institute for Advanced Study in\n1935\nhe held various positions such as consultant to the Office of Ordnance and the Coast and Geodetic Survey. He served on various councils and commissions for improving mathematics in the United States including the National research Council\n(1940\n-\n42)\nand the National Commission on Mathematics\n(1959\n-\n63)\n. At an International level he served as vice president of the International Congress of Mathematicians from\n1958\nto\n1962\nhaving earlier in his career given important lectures at the International Congress of Mathematicians in ZÃ¼rich in\n1932\nand Cambridge, USA in\n1950\n.\nMorse received many awards for his work. These include the Presidential Certificate of Merit for his war work\n(1947)\nand the National Medal for Science from the United States for his mathematical contributions, the Legion d'honneur and the Croix de Guerre from France, and a list of twenty honorary degrees from universities throughout the world. In\n1933\nthe\nAmerican Mathematical Society\nawarded him the\nBÃ´cher\nPrize for his memoir\nThe foundations of a theory of the\ncalculus of variations\nin the large in m-space\npublished in\nTransactions of the American Mathematical Society\nin\n1929\n(\nwhich he shared with\nNorbert Wiener\n)\n. The\nAmerican Mathematical Society\nmade him Colloquium Lecturer in\n1932\n, vice-president in\n1933\n-\n34\n, president in\n1941\n-\n42\n, and\nGibbs\nLecturer in\n1952\n.\nZund, writing in the\nDictionary of American Biography\n, says this of his character:-\nThroughout his life Morse retained the stamp of his Maine upbringing in his frugality and industry. He worked long hours and had many collaborators\n(\nusually at the postgraduate level\n)\nto whom he transmitted his boundless enthusiasm for mathematics."
