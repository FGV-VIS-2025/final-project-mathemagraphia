  "biografia": "Vijay Patodi\nattended the Government Higher Secondary School in Guna before entering Vikram University in Ujjain. After obtaining his B.Sc. degree from Vikram University, Patodi moved to Banares Hindu University were he studied for his Master's Degree in Mathematics. This was awarded in\n1966\nand Patodi then spent a year at the Centre for Advanced Study at the University of Bombay.\nIn\n1967\nPatodi joined the School of Mathematics of the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research in Bombay and he was to remain on the staff there until his death at the distressingly early age of\n31\n.\nMathematical fame for Patodi came early in his career with papers of great importance coming for the work of his Ph.D. His doctoral thesis,\nHeat equation and the index of elliptic operators\n, was supervised by M S Narasimhan and S Ramanan and the degree was awarded by the University of Bombay in\n1971\n.\nPatodi's first paper\nCurvature and the eigenforms of the\nLaplace\noperator\nwas part of his thesis and the contents of this paper are described in\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nAn analytic approach, via the heat equation yields easily a formula for the index of an elliptic operator on a compact\nmanifold\n: but, the formula involves an integrand containing too many derivatives of the symbol, while from the Atiyah-Singer index theorem one would expect only two derivatives to figure. ... Patodi's first contribution was to prove that such a fantastic cancellation of higher derivatives did indeed take place.\nThe second paper which came from his thesis was An analytic proof of the\nRiemann\n- Roch- Hirzebruch theorem for Kaehler manifolds which extended the methods of his first paper to a much more complicated situation.\nThe years\n1971\nto\n1973\nwere ones which Patodi spent on leave at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton. There he worked with\nM F Atiyah\nand made several visits to work with others in his field at various centres in the United States and England. During this time he also collaborated with\nR Bott\nand\nI M Singer\n.\nOn his return to Bombay and the Tata Institute in\n1973\nPatodi was promoted to associate professor. He was promoted to full professor in\n1976\nbut by this time his health was very poor. He had in fact had to overcome health problems for most of his career, making his achievements the more remarkable.\nPatodi's publications, in addition to the two mentioned above, include a number of joint ones with\nAtiyah\nand\nSinger\n. These papers introduce a spectral invariant of a compact Riemannian manifold. In another paper he studies the relationship between Riemannian structures and triangulations. Other work gives a combinatorial formula for\nPontryagin\nclasses."
