  "biografia": "Eugen Netto\n's father was Heinrich Netto\n(1795\n-\n1889)\n, an official at the Franckesche Stiftung at Halle. The Stiftung was a Protestant religious institute which included a school for the poor, an orphanage, a medical centre, and publishing house. Eugen's mother was Sophie Louise Neumann\n(1816\n-\n89)\n. We note that several biographies give\n1848\nas Netto's year of birth but Netto himself gives\n1846\nin the Vita at the end of his dissertation\n[\n12\n]\nand it seems highly unlikely that he would have made an error. Up to the age of eleven Eugen attended a school in Halle, but from that time he went to the Friedrich-Wilhelm\nGymnasium\nin Berlin, an excellent school founded in\n1797\n.\nKarl Ferdinand Ranke\n(1802\n-\n1876)\n, a classical philologist, was the rector of the Friedrich-Wilhelm-Gymnasium from\n1842\nto\n1876\n, so was the rector when Netto began his studies there. Ranke introduced more English, French and mathematics into the curriculum at the expense of Greek. Netto was fortunate to have two outstanding teachers of mathematics at the Gymnasium in Karl Heinrich Schellbach and August Rudolph Luchterhandt. Schellbach\n(1805\n-\n1892)\nhad studied mathematics, physics and philosophy at Halle before being awarded a doctorate by the University of Jena in\n1834\n. He had been a teacher at the Friedrich-Wilhelm Gymnasium from\n1841\nwhere he had taught\nGotthold Eisenstein\n. Luchterhandt was born\n1810\nin Marienwerder, and had studied at the University of KÃ¶nigsberg before becoming a teacher of mathematics at the Friedrich-Wilhelm-Gymnasium. Both Luchterhandt and Schellbach were excellent mathematicians and exceptional teachers but it was Schellbach who showed Netto the excitement of mathematics and from that time on mathematics was clearly the only topic that he considered. After graduating from the Gymnasium in\n1866\n, Netto entered the University of Berlin to study mathematics. He mentions in his Vita in\n[\n12\n]\nthat Alexander Carl Heinrich Braun\n(1805\n-\n1877)\n, who was a botanist, was rector of the University of Berlin when he entered.\nAt the University of Berlin he again had some inspiring teachers in\nLeopold Kronecker\n,\nKarl Weierstrass\nand\nErnst Eduard Kummer\n. However, there were others whose courses he took while studying there. These included: Heinrich Wilhelm Dove\n(1803\n-\n1879)\n, a physicist and meteorologist who was appointed an ordinary professor at Berlin in\n1845\n; Wilhelm Julius Foerster\n(1832\n-\n1921)\n, an astronomer who became a professor at Berlin University in\n1858\nand worked at the Berlin Observatory becoming director in\n1865\n; Friedrich Harms\n(1819\n-\n1880)\n, a philosopher who, after being appointed as an ordinary professor at Kiel in\n1858\n, was appointed to Berlin in\n1867\n; Georg Hermann Quincke\n(1834\n-\n1924)\n, a physicist who was a docent in Berlin from\n1858\nand a professor from\n1865\n; Wilhelm Ludwig ThomÃ©, a mathematician who had been advised by\nWeierstrass\nand awarded a Ph.D. in\n1865\n; and Friedrich Adolf Trendelenburg\n(1802\n-\n1872)\n, a philosopher who was an ordinary professor at Berlin from\n1837\n. Netto says in\n[\n12\n]\nthat he greatly benefited by the outstanding teaching of all these men but his greatest thanks went to\nLeopold Kronecker\n,\nErnst Eduard Kummer\nand\nKarl Weierstrass\n.\nNetto graduated from Berlin in\n1870\nhaving worked specifically under\nWeierstrass\nand\nKummer\n. It was in fact\nWeierstrass\nwho examined his final\n20\n-page doctoral dissertation, written in Latin,\nDe transformatione aequationis\ny\nn\n=\nR\n(\nx\n)\ny^{n} = R(x)\ny\nn\n=\nR\n(\nx\n)\n, designante\nR\n(\nx\n)\nR(x)\nR\n(\nx\n)\nfunctionem integram rationalem variabilis x in aequationem\nÎ·\n2\n=\nR\n1\n(\nx\ni\n)\n\\eta^{2} = R_{1}(xi)\nÎ·\n2\n=\nR\n1\nâ\n(\nx\ni\n)\nâ\n(\nThe transformation of the equation  y\nn\n= R\n(\nx\n)\ndesignating \\R\n(\nx\n)\nas a rational function of the variable x in the equation \\ Î·\n2\n= R\n1\n(\nxi\n)\n)\n. He defended his thesis in a public examination on\n2\nNovember\n1870\nwith three opponents,\nErnst Heinrich Bruns\n, Friedrich Wilhelm August Ludwig Kiepert, and Paul Simon.\nBruns\nhas a biography in this archive. He was awarded a Ph.D. in\n1871\nadvised by\nWeierstrass\nand\nKummer\n. Kiepert\n(1846\n-\n1934)\nwas awarded a Ph.D. in\n1870\n, also advised by\nWeierstrass\nand\nKummer\n. Simon was a student at Berlin at the time of the examination and was awarded a Ph.D. from Halle-Wittenburg in\n1876\n. Netto had to submit three further minor theses in order to obtain his doctorate. These, again written in Latin, were:\n1\n. Â\nFacilis in analysin valorum negativorum introductio nocuit cognitioni valorum complexorum.\n2\n. Â\nGeneralitatem atque necessitatem signa esse judiciorum a priori, Kantius non satis confirmavit.\n3\n. Â\nTrigonometria ita est docenda, ut a circulo non a triangulo rectangulo considerando initium capiatur.\nThere was no immediate university appointment for Netto, however, and he taught at the Friedrich-Werder Gymnasium in Berlin for nine years before being appointed as extraordinary professor at the University of Strasbourg in\n1879\n. For the first few years teaching at this Gymnasium, Netto published relatively little, the only publication after his\n1870\ndissertation before\n1877\nwas\nZur Theorie der zusammengesetzten Gruppen\nâ\n(\nOn the theory of composite groups\n)\n(1874)\n. He published two papers in\n1877\n, namely\nBeweise und LehrsÃ¤tze Ã¼ber transitive Gruppen\nâ\n(\nProofs and theorems on transitive groups\n)\nand\nNeuer Beweis fÃ¼r die UnauflÃ¶sbarkeit der Gleichungen von hÃ¶herem als dem vierten Grade\nâ\n(\nA new proof of the unsolvability of equations of degree higher than four\n)\n. In\n1878\nhe published three papers, two on substitution groups and one on entire functions.\nFor a list of Netto's publications, see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nIt was the French-German war of\n1870\n-\n71\n, which ended with Alsace being annexed by the German empire, that had led to a German university being set up in Strasbourg. In\n1872\nthe so-called Kaiser-Wilhelms-UniversitÃ¤t was opened in Strasbourg. The Mathematics Seminar there was directed by\nElwin Christoffel\nand\nTheodor Reye\n, and Netto took part in this seminar. His involvement is described in\n[\n15\n]\nwhere interesting background information about the working conditions and the number of students is given. In\n1880\n, while he was Strasbourg, Netto married Hedwig Elfriede Freund\n(1860\n-\n1921)\n; they had one son and two daughters.\nAfter three years at the University of Strasbourg\nWeierstrass\nrecommended that Netto be appointed an extraordinary professor at the University of Berlin and he took up the appointment in\n1882\n. There he taught courses on advanced algebra, the\ncalculus of variations\n, mechanics,\nFourier\nseries, and synthetic geometry. Netto held this post in Berlin until\n1888\nwhen he was appointed ordinary professor at the University of Giessen. He held this post for twenty-five years until his retirement in\n1913\n. He gave a course of lectures entitled\nEinleitung in die Algebra\nâ\n(\nIntroduction to algebra\n)\nduring the summer semester of each year in the University of Giessen. This course became the book\nElementare Algebra\nâ\n(\nElementary algebra\n)\n(1904)\n.\nIn\n1878\nhe attempted the second general proof of the invariance of 'dimension' but, like the first by\nJohannes Thomae\n, it was not completely satisfactory. Despite this, Netto's \"proof\" was widely accepted as providing a solution to the dimension problem until Jurgens' criticism in\n1899\nof Netto's proof. Jurgens similarly criticised a proof of the invariance of 'dimension' which had been given by\nGeorg Cantor\n. These events are fully described in\n[\n10\n]\n.\nCantor\nshowed in\n1878\nthat the unit interval\nI\nI\nI\ncan be mapped bijectively onto the unit square\nI\n2\nI^{2}\nI\n2\n. In the following year Netto showed that such a mapping cannot be a continuous function. These results by\nCantor\nand Netto are starting points for the investigations of space-filling curves which are an active research area today.\nNetto made major steps towards abstract group theory when he combined\npermutation group\nresults and groups in\nnumber theory\n. He did not however include\nmatrix\ngroups! He published this work in his book\nSubstitutionentheorie und ihre Anwendung auf die Algebra\nâ\n(\nSubstitution theory and its application to algebra\n)\nin Berlin in\n1882\ndescribed by Biermann in\n[\n1\n]\nas:-\n... a milestone in the development of abstract group theory.\nThe book was translated into English by\nFrank Nelson Cole\nand published under the title\nThe theory of substitutions and its applications to algebra\n(1892)\n.\nOskar Bolza\nwrote a review in which he wrote\n[\n5\n]\n:-\nThe great merit of Netto's book consists in the skilful and highly pedagogical presentation of the theory of substitutions, given in the first part of the book. The reader is gradually led from the most elementary considerations on symmetric and alternating functions to the general theory of unsymmetric functions of\nn\nn\nn\nindependent elements, out of which the theory of substitutions is step by step evolved, the unsymmetric functions serving all the while as a concrete substratum for the abstract conclusions of the theory of substitutions. By this means an easy and attractive entrance into the theory of substitutions is gained, accessible even to the beginner, and it may fairly be said that Netto's book has largely contributed to spread the knowledge of this important branch of mathematics.\nFor a longer extract from\nBolza\n's review, see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nFor\nCole\n's translation of Netto's Preface to the\n1882\nGerman text, see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nThis was only the first of a number of important books published by Netto. Others were:\nVorlesungen Ã¼ber Algebra\n. Band\n1\nâ\n(\nLectures on algebra. part\n1\n)\n(1896)\n;\nVorlesungen Ã¼ber Algebra. Erste Lieferung des\n2\n. Bandes\nâ\n(\nLectures on algebra. First part of the\n2\nnd volume\n)\n(1900)\n;\nÃber die Grundlagen und die Anwendungen der Mathematik\nâ\n(\nOn the fundamentals and applications of mathematics\n)\n(1900)\n;\nLehrbuch der Combinatorik\nâ\n(\nTextbook of combinatorics\n)\n(1901)\n;\nElementare Algebra. Akademische Vorlesungen fÃ¼r Studierende der ersten Semester\nâ\n(\nElementary algebra. Lectures for students of the first semesters\n)\n(1904)\n;\nGruppen- und Substitutionentheorie\nâ\n(\nGroups and substitution theory\n)\n(1908)\n;\nDie Determinanten\nâ\n(\nDeterminants\n)\n(1910)\n; and\nGrundlehren der Mathematik.\n1\n. Teil,\n2\n. Band: Algebra\nâ\n(\nFundamentals of Mathematics.\n1\nst part,\n2\nnd volume: Algebra\n)\n(1915)\n.\nFor extracts of reviews of some of these books see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nHe further contributed to the development of group theory in other papers. In particular, in\n1877\nNetto had given new proofs of the\nSylow\n's theorems. His book\nGruppen- und Substitutionentheorie\nâ\n(\nGroups and substitution theory\n)\n(1908)\nis an important introduction to group theory. Harold Hilton writes\n[\n9\n]\n:-\nThe author has succeeded in producing a book which is elementary and is quite the sort of thing a beginner wants. The exposition is very clear, and the earlier chapters contain many useful illustrative examples.\nReviewing the same book, William Benjamin Fite write\n[\n7\n]\n:-\nProfessor Netto aims to give in this book an introduction to the theory of groups of finite order. He has succeeded admirably in his purpose. ... In publishing so excellent a treatment of the subject Professor Netto has performed a service of value to the mathematical public.\nFor longer extracts from these reviews, see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nHe also contributed a number of articles to\nEnzyklopÃ¤die der Mathematischen Wissenschaften\nâ\n(\nEncyclopaedia of Mathematical Sciences\n)\n. For example:\nCombinatorik\nâ\n(\nCombinatorics\n)\n;\nRationale Functionen einer VerÃ¤nderlichen, ihre Nullstellen\nâ\n(\nRational functions of a variable, their zeros\n)\n; and\nRationale Functionen mehrerer VerÃ¤nderlichen\nâ\n(\nRational functions of several variables\n)\n.\nBeginning in\n1910\n, Netto suffered from Parkinson's disease, which as the disease progressed forced him to withdraw increasingly from the public. He retired from his professorship at the University of Giessen in\n1913\nand spent the last six years of his life in increasing difficulty as his health deteriorated."
