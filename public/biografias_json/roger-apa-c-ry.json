  "biografia": "Roger ApÃ©ry\n's father, Georges ApÃ©ry\n(1887\n-\n1978)\n, was born in Constantinople in\n1887\nbut he was of Greek origin. He was a student at the Ãcole Nationale SupÃ©rieure d'IngÃ©nieurs at Grenoble having arrived in France a couple of years earlier, in\n1903\n, to prepare for his studies. He was still in France when World War I broke out in\n1914\nand, as a way of gaining French citizenship, he enlisted to fight for France. For his service he was awarded the Croix de Combattant Volontaire. While fighting in the Dardanelles, he contracted typhoid and was returned to France to recuperate. He moved to Rouen where he married Justine Vander Cruyssen\n(1992\n-\n1965)\n. She was a piano teacher and, disliking her Flemish name, she was known by the French equivalent of Vander Cruyssen, namely Delacroix. She also disliked Justine and was known as Louise. Roger, the subject of this biography, was their only child.\nThe ApÃ©ry family spent the first four years of Roger's life in Rouen then, in\n1920\n, they moved to Lille where Georges worked as an engineer. Roger attended the lycÃ©e Faidherbe in Lille and he was such a bright child that by\n1926\nhe was two grades ahead of children of his age. It was in\n1926\nthat the family moved again, this time going to Paris where Roger continued his education at the lycÃ©e Ledru-Rollin. Again he showed his brilliance, being particularly strong in history and mathematics. It was at this school that, in\n1928\n, he first met Euclid's axioms and became fascinated by the parallel postulate. Perhaps even at this stage the passion that he had for geometry throughout his life became evident. The Great Depression, which began in the United States in the summer of\n1929\n, soon began to impact other countries and by early\n1930\nFrance was in recession. The ApÃ©ry family had moved into very basic accommodation in Paris with the intention of improving their position as soon as their finances allowed them to better themselves. It was not to be, however, for the economic downturn in France led to Georges ApÃ©ry loosing his position as an engineer. Although he was only\n43\nyears old, he never managed to get a job as an engineer again being judged too old by the time the French economy improved. He was employed as a watchman at the MinistÃ¨re des Anciens Combattants and his wife helped out with the family finances by giving piano lessons. However, they never managed to afford better accommodation.\nRoger, however, continued to show his brilliance, moving to the famous lycÃ©e Louis-le-Grand in Paris. Because their home was not suitable for anyone to study in, Roger boarded with the monks of the Ãcole Bossuet\n(\nnamed after Jacques-BÃ©nigne Bossuet, a Roman Catholic bishop known for his literary works\n)\n. One day when ApÃ©ry was not in his room, the abbot searched among his papers and found one which contained the words, \"MoliÃ¨re, who was right not to like priests ...\". ApÃ©ry was given a punishment detention, and from this time on he developed a dislike of priests and the Church. He continued to be fascinated by mathematics, however, and in\n1932\nhe met the cross-ratio as a projective invariant; his love of geometry became more specific, turning into a love of\nalgebraic geometry\n. ApÃ©ry was a Concours GÃ©nÃ©ral laureate in\n1932\n, coming third in mathematics in the whole of France in the junior competition. In the following year he went one better, coming second in mathematics in the senior Concours GÃ©nÃ©ral. He also received an honourable mention in physics. He was awarded his baccalaureate in mathematics and philosophy in\n1933\nand prepared for university entry.\nA financial scandal came to light in December\n1933\nwhen investments in Alexandre Stavisky's credit organisation became worthless. Stavisky was found dead in January\n1934\nand the official story that he had committed suicide was not believed by right-wing supporters who believed in a government conspiracy. Riots followed outside the Chamber of Deputies on\n6\nFebruary and ApÃ©ry, who was already deeply politically aware, took a strong stand for radical socialism opposed to the right-wing demonstrators. In April\n1934\n, he joined Camille Pelletan's Radical Party. This was to have consequences for his academic career for, despite a brilliant performance in mathematics, ApÃ©ry was not ranked sufficiently highly to gain entry to the Ãcole Normale SupÃ©rieure in\n1935\n. Having worked hard to improve his performance in chemistry, he was ranked second in the admission examination for the Ãcole Normale SupÃ©rieure in the following year and began his university career.\nThe Munich agreement of September\n1938\n, allowing Germany to annex the Sudetenland, was signed by the French premier Ãdouard Daladier, a member of the Radical Party. This prompted ApÃ©ry, who was still an undergraduate, to resign from the Radical Party in protest. ApÃ©ry would continue as a staunch socialist but outside the mainstream parties. At the Ãcole Normale SupÃ©rieure he was coached by Raymond Marrot and came first equal in the\nAgrÃ©gation de Mathematiques\nin\n1939\n. Marrot was a Communist and the two men became friends sharing a passion for left-wing politics. The other candidate who came first equal with ApÃ©ry was\nJacqueline Ferrand\n, better known by the name she adopted after her marriage, Jacqueline Lelong-Ferrand.\nJean DieudonnÃ©\nwas an examiner for analysis and he wrote:-\nI was a member of the agrÃ©gation jury, for the only time in my life, by the way, and I gave a rather unusual analysis problem. Only two of the papers impressed me with their sense of analysis and precocious maturity very rare among candidates for the agrÃ©gation. Those two were by Roger ApÃ©ry and\nJacqueline Ferrand\n.\nApÃ©ry was already undertaking research and published\nSur les sextiques Ã\n8\nrebroussements\nâ\n(\nOn sextics with\n8\ncusps\n)\n(1939)\n.\nIn August\n1939\n, Russia and Germany signed a secret pact, the so-called Ribbentrop-Molotov pact, to divide Poland between them. The two-pronged attack on Poland began on\n1\nSeptember\n1939\nand, on the following day, Britain, France and several other countries, declared war on Germany. The Germans attacked from the west and the Russians from the east, quickly defeating the Polish army. ApÃ©ry was drafted into the French army on\n16\nSeptember\n1939\n. Over the following months France was not involved in any fighting, but spent time strengthening the Maginot line, designed to protect the country from an invasion by Germany. In February\n1940\nApÃ©ry was promoted to sublieutenant in the\n145\nth\nArtillery and sent to Nancy. The war changed dramatically for France on\n10\nMay\n1940\nwhen the German army crossed the Dutch and Belgium borders. Five days later German forces crossed into France and, by\n20\nMay, the German armies were heading for the coast. German forces entered Paris on\n14\nJune and a couple of days later France requested armistice terms but fighting continued. The Germans overcame the French at Nancy and, on\n20\nJune, ApÃ©ry was captured and became a prisoner-of-war. The armistice was signed on\n22\nJune and within a couple of days all hostilities in France had ended. ApÃ©ry, however, was held as a prisoner in Germany where, through the Red Cross, he was able to receive a number of mathematical articles sent by\nFrancesco Severi\n. Since he was suffering from pleurisy, ApÃ©ry was sent back to France for health reasons on\n11\nJune\n1941\n. This was largely due to the efforts of\nÃlie Cartan\nwho had been in contact with the German authorities making a case for his repatriation.\nApÃ©ry was discharged on\n23\nAugust\n1941\nand Georges Bruhat, director of the Ãcole Normale SupÃ©rieure and father of\nFranÃ§ois Bruhat\n, offered him a research fellowship at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique. He was able to undertake research advised by RenÃ© Garnier, at the same time lecturing at the Sorbonne. He published many papers on Italian style algebraic geometry over the next few years:\nSur les courbes d'ordre n ayant un point multiple O d'ordre n -\n4\net n -\n2\ntacnodes, les tangentes tacnodales passant par O\nâ\n(\nOn the nth order curves with a multiple point O of order  n -\n4\nand n -\n2\ntacnodes with the tacnodales tangents passing through O\n)\n(1941)\nand\nSur les quintiques Ã  cinq rebroussements\nâ\n(\nOn quintic curves with five cusps\n)\n(1941)\nwere followed by four papers in\n1942\n, and another four in\n1943\n. These, of course, were difficult times with Paris under the control of the occupying German forces. ApÃ©ry was very active in the French Resistance being director of the Front National, a resistance movement at the Ãcole Normale SupÃ©rieure, as well as forging identity papers in his room and undertaking other highly dangerous activities. In August\n1944\nthe Gestapo searched the Ãcole Normale SupÃ©rieure and ApÃ©ry, realising what was happening, burnt the incriminating papers he had been forging in his room. Georges Bruhat, director of the Ãcole Normale SupÃ©rieure, was taken prisoner at this time; he died shortly afterwards in the Buchenwald concentration camp.\nPaul Dubreil\n, who spent the years of World War II in Nancy, returned to Paris in\n1946\nand advised ApÃ©ry on submitting his thesis on algebraic geometry and ideals, which he did in\n1947\n. In the autumn of that year he was appointed as MaÃ®tre de conferences at Rennes University. Also in\n1947\nhe married Denise BienaimÃ©; they had three sons, Denys\n(\nborn\n1948)\n, FranÃ§ois\n(\nborn\n1950)\nand Robert\n(\nborn\n1953)\n. FranÃ§ois became a mathematician and is the author of\n[\n2\n]\n. He writes in that article about ApÃ©ry's married life:-\nHis romantic life was troubled. ... a tense and bitter home life ended in divorce in\n1971\n; a second marriage in\n1972\nwas followed by a second divorce in\n1977\n. He could not seem to reconcile family life, mathematical research, and political activism.\nWe note that his second wife was Claudine Lamotte.\nReturning to ApÃ©ry's career, he was invited to give the prestigious Cours Peccot at the CollÃ¨ge de France in\n1948\n; he spoke on \"Algebraic geometry and ideals\". He was only on the staff at Rennes for two years before being appointed to the University of Caen in\n1949\n. He remained in Caen for the rest of his career, being promoted to professor in\n1953\n. For many years he continued to have parallel political and mathematical careers. His support of Communist ideas came to an end in\n1948\nwhen they supported Trofim Lysenko's ideas about heredity. Lysenko disputed Mendel's theory of heredity claiming that acquired characteristics could be transmitted directly, something which suited the Communist philosophy but was highly unscientific. ApÃ©ry became a staunch supporter of Pierre MendÃ¨s-France, the radical socialist who was premier of France in\n1954\n. MendÃ¨s-France opposed both the Communists and the followers of Charles de Gaulle, and ApÃ©ry gave him his full support. In\n1958\nApÃ©ry became president of the Calvados district of the Parti rÃ©publicain radical. He continued to take an active role in politics and was sent to Algeria as a reserve lieutenant in December\n1959\non a fact finding mission. In May\n1968\nthere was a revolt by students and workers. It rapidly collapsed and, from that time on, ApÃ©ry decided to leave politics. In\n1969\nde Gaulle was defeated and ApÃ©ry resigned from the Radical Party feeling that the French Republic was no longer threatened. He retired from his chair at Caen in\n1986\nbut continued to live in Caen. However, his last years before retiring were increasingly difficult ones for he was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in\n1977\nand this slowly decreased his mental activities as well as making him increasingly less mobile.\nLet us now look at ApÃ©ry's mathematical contributions. As we noted above, his early work was on Italian style algebraic geometry. However, in the\n1950\ns he became interested in number theory and worked on\ndiophantine equations\n. In particular he studied the diophantine equation\nx\n2\n+\nA\n=\np\nn\nx^{2} + A = p^{n}\nx\n2\n+\nA\n=\np\nn\n, where\nA\nA\nA\nand\np\np\np\n(\na prime\n)\nare given.\nTwo short papers, both entitled\nSur une Ã©quation diophantienne\nâ\n(\nOn a Diophantine equation\n)\n, are devoted to a study of this equation.\nHe was also interested in the philosophy of mathematics, writing papers such as\nAxiomes et postulats\nâ\n(\nAxioms and postulates\n)\n(1949)\n,\nLe rÃ´le de l'intuition en mathÃ©matiques\nâ\n(\nThe role of intuition in mathematics\n)\n(1951)\n,\nLes mathÃ©matiques sont-elles une thÃ©orie pure?\nâ\n(\nIs mathematics purely theory?\n)\n(1952)\n,\nRÃ©forme ou dÃ©molition de l'enseignement mathÃ©matique\nâ\n(\nReform or demolition of mathematics teaching\n)\n(1971)\n,\nMathÃ©matique constructive\nâ\n(\nConstructive Mathematics\n)\n(1982)\n,\nLe temps du mathÃ©maticien\nâ\n(\nThe time of a mathematician\n)\n(1983)\n, and\nNature des objets mathÃ©matiques\nâ\n(\nThe nature of mathematical objects\n)\n(1986)\n. Pierre Ageron writes\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nRoger ApÃ©ry is well known for advocating constructive mathematics and for being a resolute opponent to formalism and Bourbakism. It is less known that he was also one of the first French academics to promote category theory, in spite of its highly structural and formal nature.\nThis mathematical output represents an excellent contribution but in\n1977\n, when he was\n61\nyears old, he produced a result of incredible brilliance. This was his proof that Î¶\n(3)\nis irrational. Note that Î¶\n(3)\nis the sum of the reciprocals of the cubes of the natural numbers.\nEuler\nhad known that\nÎ¶\n(\n2\n)\n=\n1\n1\n2\n+\n1\n2\n2\n+\n1\n3\n2\n+\n1\n4\n2\n+\n.\n.\n.\n=\n\\zeta(2) = \\large\\frac{1}{1^{2}\\normalsize}  + \\large\\frac{1}{2^{2}\\normalsize}  + \\large\\frac{1}{3^{2}\\normalsize}  + \\large\\frac{1}{4^{2}\\normalsize}  + ... =\nÎ¶\n(\n2\n)\n=\n1\n2\n1\nâ\n+\n2\n2\n1\nâ\n+\n3\n2\n1\nâ\n+\n4\n2\n1\nâ\n+\n.\n.\n.\n=\nÏ\n2\n6\n\\Large\\frac{Ï^2}{6}\n6\nÏ\n2\nâ\nand it was also known that\nÎ¶\n(\n2\nk\n)\n\\zeta(2k)\nÎ¶\n(\n2\nk\n)\nis irrational but, before ApÃ©ry, it was unknown whether\nÎ¶\n(\n2\nk\n+\n1\n)\n\\zeta(2k+1)\nÎ¶\n(\n2\nk\n+\n1\n)\nis rational or irrational. Note that it is still an open question whether\nÎ¶\n(\n2\nk\n+\n1\n)\n\\zeta(2k+1)\nÎ¶\n(\n2\nk\n+\n1\n)\nis rational for\nk\n>\n1\nk > 1\nk\n>\n1\n.\nFor a variety of reasons, mathematicians doubted that ApÃ©ry's proof would be correct when it was first announced. The problem had long been an open question, yet ApÃ©ry's proof only used methods which had been available for\n200\nyears. Also, very few mathematicians produce their most remarkable piece of work when over\n60\nyears of age. Another possible factor is that it appears that ApÃ©ry was not popular with his colleagues. Alfred van der Poorten attended JournÃ©es ArithmÃ©tiques de Marseille-Luminy in June\n1978\n. He writes\n[\n14\n]\n:-\nThe board of programme changes informed us that R ApÃ©ry\n(\nCaen\n)\nwould speak Thursday,\n14\n:\n00\n\"Sur l'irrationalite de\nÎ¶\n(\n3\n)\n\\zeta(3)\nÎ¶\n(\n3\n)\n\". Though there had been earlier rumours of his claiming a proof, scepticism was general. The lecture tended to strengthen this view to rank disbelief. Those who listened casually, or who were afflicted with being non-Francophone, appeared to hear only a sequence of unlikely assertions. I heard with some incredulity that, for one, Henri Cohen\n(\nGrenoble\n)\nbelieved that these claims might well be valid. Very much intrigued, I joined Hendrik Lenstra\n(\nAmsterdam\n)\nand Cohen in an evening's discussion, in which Cohen explained and demonstrated most of the details of the proof. We came away convinced that Professor ApÃ©ry had indeed found a quite miraculous and magnificent demonstration of the irrationality of Î¶\n(3)\n. But we remained unable to prove a critical step. ... We were quite unable to prove that\n[\ncertain sequences satisfied a recurrence as claimed by ApÃ©ry\n]\n.\n(\nApÃ©ry rather tartly pointed out to me in Helsinki that he regarded this more a compliment than a criticism of his method\n)\n. But empirically\n(\nnumerically\n)\nthe evidence in favour was utterly compelling. It seemed indeed that Î¶\n(3)\nhad been proved irrational ...\nNeither Cohen nor I had been able to prove\n[\nthe missing steps\n]\nin the intervening two months\n[\nbefore we attended the International Congress of Mathematicians at Helsinki in August\n1978]\n. After a few days of fruitless effort the specific problem was mentioned to Don Zagier\n(\nBonn\n)\n, and with irritating speed he showed that indeed the sequence satisfies the recurrence. This more or less broke the dam and\n[\nthe missing steps\n]\nwere quickly conquered. Henri Cohen addressed a very well-attended meeting at\n17\n:\n00\non Friday, August\n18\nin the language of the majority, proving\n[\nthe missing step\n]\nand explaining how this implied the irrationality of\nÎ¶\n(\n3\n)\n\\zeta(3)\nÎ¶\n(\n3\n)\n. ApÃ©ry then made some remarks on the status of the French language, and alluded to the underlying motivation for his astonishing proof. ... It is some measure of ApÃ©ry's achievement that these questions have been considered by mathematicians of the top rank over the past few centuries without much success being achieved. ... ApÃ©ry's incredible proof appears to be a mixture of miracles and mysteries. ... Most startling of all though should be the fact that ApÃ©ry's proof has no aspect that would not have been accessible to a mathematician of\n200\nyears ago. The proof we have seen is one that many mathematicians could have found, but missed.\nPhilip Gibbs gives a more colourful account of ApÃ©ry's conference announcement in\n[\n11\n]\n:-\nIn\n1978\nhe presented a lecture on his proof at the JournÃ©es ArithmÃ©tiques de Marseille which was greeted with doubt and disbelief. Each step he wrote on the blackboard appeared to be a remarkable identity that his audience considered unlikely to be true. When someone asked him \"where do these identities come from?\" he replied \"They grow in my garden.\" Obviously this did not boost anyone's confidence. Nevertheless, a few mathematicians recognised that there was something significant in the proposed proof. They checked the identities numerically and found that they did indeed seem to hold. It was not long before the full validity of ApÃ©ry's work was confirmed and the sceptics were forced to eat their words.\nIn fact Frits Beukers managed to produce a simpler version of ApÃ©ry's remarkable proof which he published in\n[\n9\n]\n. Beukers writes in\n[\n8\n]\n:-\nIt has been my good fortune to find a very simple version of the proof a few months after ApÃ©ry's announcement.\nApÃ©ry was honoured by being made a Knight of the LÃ©gion d'Honneur in December\n1970\n. He eventually succumbed to Parkinson's disease in\n1994\nafter years of ill health. He was buried in Paris, with his parents, in a small tomb set in a wall of PÃ¨re Lachaise cemetery's Columbarium. A small plaque contains the names of ApÃ©ry and his parents, and the formula:\n1\n1\n+\n1\n8\n+\n1\n27\n+\n1\n64\n+\n.\n.\n.\nâ\np\nq\n.\n\\large\\frac{1}{1}\\normalsize  + \\large\\frac{1}{8}\\normalsize  + \\large\\frac{1}{27}\\normalsize  + \\large\\frac{1}{64}\\normalsize  + ... â  \\Large\\frac{p}{q}\\normalsize .\n1\n1\nâ\n+\n8\n1\nâ\n+\n2\n7\n1\nâ\n+\n6\n4\n1\nâ\n+\n.\n.\n.\nî\nâ\n=\nq\np\nâ\n."
