  "biografia": "Ernst Ãpik\nwas the son of Karl Heinrich Ãpik, a customs officer, and Leontine Johanna Freiwald. To understand the events of Ernst Ãpik's life we need to give a very brief overview of the history of Estonia. We quote from\n[\n7\n]\n:-\nThe Estonians are a small ethnic group, closely related to the Finns, that settled in the area south of the Gulf of Finland more than a thousand years ago. Their language belongs to the Finno-Ugric group, unrelated to the Indo-European languages spoken in most of the rest of Europe. Throughout most of historical time the land of the Estonians was occupied and governed first by Germans and Danes, then by Swedes, and finally\n(\nsince\n1721)\nby Russians, but their identity was never lost. Estonia ... gained her independence in\n1920\n... Independence lasted little more than two decades ... Russian troops invaded Estonia in June\n1940\nand the country became a member republic of the Soviet Union in August of that year ... In July\n1944\nEstonia was conquered by the German army, which in turn was expelled by the Russians in July\n1944\n.\nJohanna Karl was born on\n3\nNovember\n1861\n, in Tallinn, Estonia, and Leontine was born on\n15\nDecember\n1864\n, also in Tallinn. Karl and Leontine married in\n1885\nand had ten children including: Anna\n(1886\n-\n1955)\n, who taught herself\n13\nlanguages, including Sanskrit, and translated Homer's\nOdyssey\ninto Estonian; Paul\n(1888\n-\n1967)\n, President of the Pikalaen Bank,\n1928\n-\n1940\n; Heinrich\n(1890\n-\n1890)\n, died less than one year old; Ernst\n(1893\n-\n1985)\n, the subject of this biography; Oskar\n(1895\n-\n1974)\n, Estonian ambassador to France and Germany as well as at the League of Nations; Armin\n(1898\n-\n1983)\n, Professor of Geology and Palaeontology at the University of Tartu, later Member of the\nAustralian Academy of Sciences\n.\nNorma Romot, Armin Ãpik's daughter, writes in\n[\n7\n]\nthat Karl:-\n... was orphaned at an early age and was brought up at an orphanage and on a cadet ship of the Russian Imperial navy. Because of his strict upbringing, Karl Heinrich tried to apply the same regimen at home and would have made his children's lives utter misery if my grandmother's influence had not been stronger. She was soft hearted, and taught her children languages, music, art, etc.\nErnst's interest in astronomy might well have begun when he was very young as his brother Oskar suggested\n[\n16\n]\n:-\nErnst's sister Anna was the one who opened his eyes to the beauty of heaven and stars in the courtyard of the port on one night - it was probably a small comet in Lyra that brother Ernst observed and he has since become a world-renowned astronomy scholar.\nIn\n1900\nErnst left Kunda and went to Tallinn where he attended the Nikolai High School. This school was founded in\n1631\nby the King of Sweden Gustav II Adolf but was renamed Nikolai I Gymnasium by the Russians. Up to\n1890\nit had been a German speaking school but the Russian adopted a policy of Russification and brought in Russian teachers who taught in Russian. Ernst, however, reacted against the Russification by being active in a secret literary circle who made an introduction to Estonian literature. Ernst wrote of his school years\n[\n5\n]\n:-\nIn the upper classes of the school, I organized a circle of physicists-mathematicians who relied on me to be so confident about physics that we were given free access to the physics and chemistry laboratories. I especially studied and gave presentations in chemistry ... With one of my brothers and Karl Reinberg, I founded a group of astronomers, the Vega circle of amateurs, and we bought a telescope, which is currently owned by the University of Tartu, donated by the former Vega members. With its rare lens, I observed the planet Mars in Tallinn in autumn\n1911\n, which also resulted in my first scientific paper published in\n1912\n.\nÃpik graduated from the high school in\n1911\nwith the gold medal. Fred Singer writes\n[\n15\n]\n:-\nHe\n[\nÃpik\n]\nclaimed that he learnt all of the important physics and mathematics at that high school ...\nHe wished to study astronomy at the University of Moscow but, as he explained some\n25\nyears later, he could not begin immediately\n[\n5\n]\n:-\nAfter graduating from upper secondary school, I could not go to university right away, namely for economic reasons; with ten children there was no way for our parents to support their studies - on the contrary, we, the children, when studying at high school had to be able to support the family by giving paid lessons. In the year following graduation I studied mathematics - almost the entire university mathematics course was covered in this year, so that later, at university, I could immediately start research in my field. Already having a sufficient mathematical preparation I continued, of course, with astronomical observations.\nIn the autumn of\n1912\nÃpik began his studies at the University of Moscow. He chose the University of Moscow rather than the University of Tartu because in Moscow he could earn some money giving lessons but it was still a great struggle and he had to run up debts living in the Moscow Society of Estonia dormitory which he settled when he had the chance to give more lessons. Despite these difficulties, between\n1912\nand\n1916\nhe produced\n18\narticles, showing a rapid development from an amateur level at the beginning to a top world-class researcher by the end of the four years. Although a student, he seems largely self-taught for he claimed he had nothing to learn from the astronomy professors at the University of Moscow, Vitold Czerask\n(1849\n-\n1925)\nand Pavel Sternberg\n(1865\n-\n1920)\n. He graduated with an astronomy degree in\n1916\nand continued to work to qualify as a university professor.\nThe Russian Revolution of\n1917\nsaw the country enter political chaos, with coup attempts and a collapsing economy with food shortages. Ãpik was not the only member of his family in Moscow at that time for his brother Oskar and sister Anna were also there. Oskar wrote\n(\nsee\n[\n9\n]\n)\n:-\nI remember one day when Ernst and I had nothing to sustain us except the boiling water in the samovar. It was then that Anna arrived, like an angel, with food.\nMoscow remained relatively quiet for much of\n1917\nbut, after the Bolsheviks seized power in St Petersburg in October, fighting began in Moscow. By\n3\nNovember the Bolsheviks were in control of the city. Ãpik was totally opposed to the Bolsheviks so he joined the White Army, travelling to Yaroslavl where the Red Army was stationed. Ãpik had a mysterious girlfriend in Yaroslavl which proved useful when he was captured by the Bolsheviks and sentenced to death. He claimed he had been using false identity papers so he could visit his married lover in Yaroslavl. He must have been convincing for he was released and able to return to astronomy in Moscow. We quote from Ãpik's own description of the events of\n1919\n[\n13\n]\n:-\nIn the beginning of\n1919\n, when Bolshevik rule was firmly established in most of Russia, with some fighting still continuing on the fringes, the new rulers decided to found a university in Tashkent ... . Over\n100\nprofessors and other teaching staff with their families volunteered to leave starving Moscow and to start a new life in the food-rich but otherwise risky Asiatic surroundings. As the only astronomer in the group, I was to be Chairman of Astronomy and put new life into Tashkent Observatory. A former military geodetic observatory, it had been reorganized by V V Stratonoff, but after three decades of respectable research activity it had somehow fallen into disarray during the Revolution, and it was now to be made an integral part of the new Turkestan University. Rail communications in Russia were at that time in a state of disorganization, and so it was no wonder that our legendary trek of\n3000\nkm from Moscow to Tashkent took\n70\ndays, from end of January to beginning of April,\n1919\n. ... After arrival in April,\n1919\n, I served for two years on the faculty of the newly organized Turkestan University, with my main concern being the revitalization of the Tashkent Observatory.\nIn\n1921\nafter only knowing each other for a short time, Ãpik married Vera Oreshkina in\n1921\n. Vera had been born on\n17\nJuly\n1901\n, in Don Oblast, Russia.\nPublishing was difficult, in fact almost impossible, for Ãpik in Tashkent and he decided to make efforts to return to Estonia, his beloved native land, which at that time had become an independent country. On\n1\nDecember\n1921\nÃpik was appointed to the University of Tartu where he worked at the Astronomical Observatory. He published two estimates of the distance to the Andromeda nebula M\n31\n, one in\n1921\nand the other in the following year, both based on an estimate of its mass derived from its observed velocity of rotation compared with its centripetal acceleration. Both are reasonable, the first being an overestimate, the second an underestimate. The two values come from using different mass-luminosity ratios. In the\n1922\npaper, he states that, assuming his distance estimate is reasonable\n[\n6\n]\n:-\n... the nebula is a stellar universe comparable with our Galaxy.\nThis was confirmed by\nEdwin Hubble\nin\n1923\nusing\nHenrietta Swan Leavitt\n's Cepheid variable period/luminosity relationship.\nIn\n1922\nErnest and Vera Ãpik's first daughter, Maija, was born. He submitted a thesis on meteor observations to the University of Tartu and was awarded a doctorate in\n1923\n. Ãpik was by this time publishing a remarkable number of papers: in\n1922\neight of his papers appeared totalling\n143\npages; in\n1923\n, eight of his papers appeared totalling\n152\npages; in\n1924\nnine works were published having a total of\n479\npages. At the Astronomical Observatory in Tartu, Ãpik had a research assistant Alide Piiri, who had been born on\n30\nJune\n1899\n, in Torila, Tartumaa. In\n1926\nÃpik had two children, a daughter called Inna with his wife, and a son, Uno, by Alide. At first his wife Vera did not know about Alide and Uno. Reasonably enough, she was very angry when she learnt about them but she came to accept the situation. Ãpik set up a second home with Alide, had a second daughter Elina with his wife Vera, followed by two daughters Helgi and Tiiu with Alide.\nIn\n1930\nÃpik went to Harvard University in the United States where he spent much time over the following four years as a Visiting Scientist and Lecturer. He had been invited by\nHarlow Shapley\n, the director of the Observatory\n[\n6\n]\n:-\nDuring his stay in the USA, Ãpik created a lot of interest for meteors among the Harvard astronomers and thereby generated the later Harvard meteor programme. Already in\n1932\n, Ãpik discussed the influence of stellar perturbations on nearly parabolic ellipses, which\n18\nyears later was to be an important mechanism in Oort's concept of the Comet Cloud surrounding the Sun. It is for this reason that Whipple, who started his professional career in\n1931\nat the Harvard College Observatory and who entered the field of meteor research because of Ãpik's influence, always speaks of the \"Ãpik-Oort Comet Cloud\".\nÃpik returned to the Astronomical Observatory in Tartu in\n1934\nand there followed a number of happy years before World War II\n[\n9\n]\n:-\nEstonia was overrun by the Red Army in\n1940\n, and a year later by the Nazis. Ernst refused to let the small matters of war get in the way of his research. But in\n1944\n, with the Red Army re-invading, he decided to flee. \"I would go to the sea and drown myself rather than live under the Russians,\" he said. With the Red Army closing in, he ordered Alide and their three children to go by van to Tallinn while he put family possessions on a horse-drawn cart. Tallinn was under a thick pall of smoke from locals burning their papers before the Soviets arrived, destroying evidence of collusion with the Germans. The family sailed to Germany and lived for several years in camps as refugees. Ernst had also helped two of his daughters by Vera, Maija and Inna, to escape. They found their way to America, but the youngest, Elina, just\n15\n, stayed with her mother. She would have no contact with her father until after Stalin's death almost a decade later, and did not see him for\n34\nyears.\nArriving in Germany, Ãpik, with Alide and family, went to Hamburg Observatory and was given hospitality until the war ended. After this a Baltic University was set up in Hamburg in March\n1946\nto provide education for displaced students and Ãpik became Professor of Astronomy and the Rector for Estonian students. This University was always going to be a short-term venture so Ãpik had to find permanent employment. In fact the University closed in\n1949\nbut Ãpik had left in\n1948\n. The astronomers at Harvard learnt of Ãpik's predicament and Eric Mervyn Lindsay\n(1907\n-\n1974)\ncame to his help. Lindsay had been born in Northern Ireland and studied at Queen's University, Belfast. He went to Harvard University to undertake research for his doctorate which he was awarded in\n1934\n. Lindsay had, therefore, been a research student at Harvard at the time Ãpik worked there and, in fact, Ãpik had been one of the examiners of Lindsay's Ph.D. thesis. Lindsay had returned to Northern Ireland in\n1937\nwhere he was appointed director of Armagh Observatory. In December\n1947\nLindsay offered Ãpik the position of Research Associate at Armagh Observatory and he arrived in Northern Ireland to take up the position in June\n1948\n. He was accompanied by Alide and family.\nAlthough Ãpik continued to work at the Armagh Observatory for the rest of his career, he also made many visits to the University of Maryland in the United States beginning in\n1956\n. Fred Singer writes in\n[\n15\n]\n:-\nWhen I invited Ãpik to the University of Maryland in\n1956\n, I had never met him before. It was his work that attracted my attention. And it was his work habits that had a profound influence on my own scientific career. He steered me towards planets and satellites, and taught me to use simple physical principles in place of more obscure mathematical approaches.\nD J Mullan writes in\n[\n12\n]\n:-\nDuring the semester when he was in residence in Maryland, he usually taught a seminar on a research topic which was currently of interest to him. When I took the seminar\n(\nit happened to be about cometary break-up\n)\n, I found that Dr Ãpik had little or no time for teaching material which he considered as already well-established in the field of knowledge. He gave the impression of always wanting to be on the frontiers of knowledge, even in the classroom: anyone who took his seminar was expected, I suppose, to absorb the well-established material elsewhere.\nA newspaper report in November\n1962\nmay show more about Ãpik's passionate dislike of Russians than anything else:-\nCollege Park, Maryland. A world-famous astronomer says he will be pleasantly surprised if the Russian space vehicle now heading towards Mars adds any significant information on space science. Dr Ernest J Ãpik, visiting research professor at the University of Maryland, said in an interview Thursday that the \"Russians have contributed only five-tenths of one per cent\" of the new information on space. \"They\n(\nthe Russians\n)\nprofess to have sent huge payloads into space\n10\nto\n100\ntimes larger than any the United States are capable of sending,\" Dr Ãpik said. \"At the same time, however,\n99\n.\n5\nper cent of all new information on space has come from the United States probes.\nIn Northern Ireland, Eric Lindsay initiated the founding of the\nIrish Astronomical Journal\nin\n1950\nedited by Ãpik. He remained as editor until he retired in\n1981\nat the age of\n87\n. Even after this he continued as an associate editor up until his death in\n1985\n.\nOther than astronomy, the other passion in Ãpik's life was music. He played the piano to a very high standard and he composed piano pieces which have been published.\nWilliam McCrea\nwrites\n[\n10\n]\n:-\nOn the evening in\n1975\nafter the meeting of the\nRoyal Astronomical Society\nat which he had received his Gold Medal, it fell to my lot to propose his health at dinner. ... I then indicated to him that the company would be pleased if he cared to say just a few words in reply. ... He got to his feet - and said nothing! He sang! I was too startled properly to take in the words - they seemed a graceful acknowledgement of the honour and of our congratulations upon it.\nÃpik received many honours for his outstanding contributions to astronomy. He was elected to the\nEstonian Academy of Sciences\n(1938)\n, the\nRoyal Astronomical Society\n(1949)\n, The\nRoyal Irish Academy\n(1954)\n, the\nNational Academy of Sciences\n(\nUnited States\n)\n(1975)\n, and the\nAmerican Academy of Arts and Sciences\n(1977)\n. He received honorary degrees by Queen's University, Belfast\n(1968)\nand the University of Sheffield\n(1977)\n. Among many prizes and awards he received we mention the J Lawrence Smith Medal from the\nNational Academy of Sciences\n(\nUnited States\n)\n(1960)\n, the F C Leonard Medal of the International Meteoritical Society\n(1968)\n, a Gold Medal from the American Association for the Advancement of Science\n(1974)\n, the Gold Medal of the\nRoyal Astronomical Society\n(1975)\n, the Catherine Wolfe Bruce Gold Medal of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific\n(1976)\n, and the Louis Jacot Grand Prix, PensÃ©e University, Paris\n(1978)\n.\nAs a final comment, we note that Ãpik's only son was Uno Ãpik\n(1926\n-\n2005)\nwho studied at Tartu High School, then left with his parents for Germany in\n1944\n. He studied at the Baltic University\n1946\n-\n48\nafter which he moved to Northern Ireland with his parents. He was awarded a Ph.D. from Queen's University, Belfast in\n1954\n. He then taught physics and applied mathematics at several universities with his career mainly being at Queen's University, Belfast from\n1962\nto\n1986\n. Uno Ãpik married Liivi Vedo and their eldest son was Lembit Ãpik\n(\nborn\n1965)\nwho became a Liberal Democrat member of the British Parliament from\n1997\nto\n2010\n. He was also a well-known television personality and currently presents radio and television shows."
