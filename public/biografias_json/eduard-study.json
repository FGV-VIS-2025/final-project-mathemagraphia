  "biografia": "Eduard Study\nwas the son of Carl Traugott Wilhelm Study, a teacher of Latin, Greek, German and history at the Coburg\nGymnasium\n, and Caroline Therese Henriette von Langsdorff. Eduard's talent for mathematics was probably inherited from his mother for his great grandfather Karl Christian von Langsdorff had been a professor of mathematics at Heidelberg from\n1806\nto\n1834\nwhile his grandfather Wilhelm Gustav von Langsdorff\n(1803\n-\n1847)\nhad taught applied mathematics at St Petersburg and Mannheim. Eduard was christened Christian Hugo Eduard Study on\n16\nApril\n1862\nbut he always used the name Eduard. When he was four years old, his mother died. His father wrote\n(\nsee\n[\n4\n]\n)\n:-\nMonday,\n13\nAugust\n1866\n. At\n7\n:\n55\nearly in the morning my dearly beloved, good, good wife breathed her last breath. She died after a long and terrible suffering with pulmonary tuberculosis. ... So I am left alone with the task of educating the child that she gave me. When will I find my motivation?\nCarl Study, Eduard's father, got a lot of support from the rest of his family. In particular, his sister-in-law Elise was a great help to him bringing up Eduard and Carl married Elsie two years after the death of his first wife. Sadly, Elsie also died of tuberculosis when Eduard was eleven years old and after that, alone with his father, he enjoyed a strict upbringing. It was not a religious upbringing; quite the reverse for he was brought up by his father to think for himself and he received no religious education. Although Eduard seems to have inherited more from his mother than from his father, one love which he did inherit from his father was a love of nature. Carl was a member of the Alpine Club and enjoyed trips with botanists. When Eduard was twelve years old his father sent him for a\n3\n-week holiday in the Upper Bavarian forests. Rather remarkably, he sent the twelve year old Eduard on this holiday on his own. Eduard attended the Coburg Gymnasium where his two favourite subjects were mathematics and biology and, after graduating from school in\n1880\n, he entered the University of Jena to study with the biologist Ernst HÃ¤ckel\n(1834\n-\n1919)\n. HÃ¤ckel was professor of comparative anatomy at Jena from\n1862\nto\n1909\n.\nAfter studying at the University of Jena for a year, Study decided that he wanted to move towards mathematics and in order to do this he went to the University of Strasbourg to work with\nTheodor Reye\n.\nReye\nhad published a two volume work on synthetic geometry\nGeometrie der Lage\nâ\n(\nGeometry of position\n)\n> in\n1866\nand\n1868\n. Study solved all the problems in the first volume of this book during the academic year\n1881\n-\n82\nwhen he was at Strasbourg. He spent the winter semester of\n1882\n-\n83\nat the University of Leipzig before returning to Strasbourg. He did not spend long on this second period at Strasbourg for he soon moved to the Ludwig-Maximilians University of Munich.\nWe should note that Study, almost certainly because of his upbringing, worked in a very solitary manner. He did not attend many lectures preferring instead to work on his own. This, in many ways, was not because he thought this the best method of working. Rather it seems that he would liked to have behaved differently but felt that he had not had the best training in his youth. He wrote in a letter to\nFriedrich Engel\nin January\n1892\n(\nsee\n[\n4\n]\n)\n:-\nI envy anyone who has learned anything decent in his youth. My self-taught patchy knowledge annoys me ...\nHe sat his final examination at the University of Munich on\n21\nJuly\n1884\n. This consisted of three written questions, two on mathematics and one on physics. Despite the fact that Study chose to prove a generalisation of one of the problems that had been set,\nPhilipp von Seidel\ncriticised his solution as clumsy. He then had an oral examination with examiners Philipp von Jolly\n(1809\n-\n1884)\n, Gustav Bauer\n(1820\n-\n1906)\n, the professor of botany Ludwig, Adolph Timotheus Radlkofer\n(1829\n-\n1927)\n, and the dean Adolf von Baeyer\n(1835\n-\n1917)\n, who was a chemist. He was awarded Grade I in mathematics, his major subject, and also in physics and in botany. Naturally, the overall Grade was also I.\nHe obtained his doctorate from the University of Munich in\n1884\nfor his thesis\nÃber die Massbestimmung extensiver GrÃ¶ssen\nâ\n(\nOn the mass determination of extensive magnitudes\n)\n. He had been advised by\nPhilipp von Seidel\nand Gustav Bauer. He published his thesis in\n1885\nbut this was not his first mathematics publication since\nÃber Distanzrelationen\nâ\n(\nOn distance relationships\n)\n(1882)\n,\nElementare Beweise einiger geometrischer SÃ¤tze\nâ\n(\nElementary evidence of some geometrical theorems\n)\n(1883)\n, and\nGeometrische Konstruktion der Abbildung des Kreisringes auf ein Rechteck\nâ\n(\nGeometric construction of the figure of the annulus to a rectangle\n)\n(1884)\nhad already appeared. The last two mentioned papers were published in\nCrelle\n's Journal. After the award of his doctorate, Study returned to the University of Leipzig where he worked on his\nhabilitation\nthesis encouraged by\nFelix Klein\nto whom he expressed his \"very special thanks\". In\n1885\nStudy was appointed as an assistant in mathematics at the University of Leipzig where, in addition to\nKlein\n, he met\nDavid Hilbert\nwho had just arrived there. The fact that he was largely self taught in mathematics clearly showed in his very individual approach. Although his interests were close to those of\nHilbert\n, he found it difficult to work with him.\nHilbert\nwrote in a letter to\nAdolf Hurwitz\n(\nsee\n[\n5\n]\n)\n:-\nStudy is a strange person, almost at the opposite pole from my nature and, as I think I can judge, from yours too. Dr Study approves, or rather he knows, only one field of mathematics and that is the\ntheory of invariants\n, very exclusively the symbolic theory of invariants. Everything else is unmethodical 'fooling around' ... He condemns for this reason all other mathematicians; even in his own field he considers himself to be the only authority, at times attacking all the other mathematicians of the symbolic theory of invariants in the most aggressive fashion. He is one who condemns everything he doesn't know whereas, for example, my nature is such that I am most impressed by just that which I don't yet know.\nKlein\nsuggested that both\nHilbert\nand Study should visit Erlangen and discuss their research with\nPaul Gordan\nwho was the leading expert on invariant theory. However, the visit did not take place at that time.\nKlein\nthen told both Study and\nHilbert\nthat they should visit Paris. They both went in early\n1886\n, Study arriving first.\nKlein\nhad given them instructions as to which of the Paris mathematicians they should visit and they did as he told them, alternately writing to\nKlein\nabout their experiences. One of the first mathematicians they visited was\nHenri PoincarÃ©\nwho returned their visit a few days later. The two young visitors read their letters to\nKlein\nout loud to each other so that they would not both tell him the same things. He replied to each in turn, making clear that he was treating them equally. In a letter written to Study,\nKlein\ncontinued to insist that he must have personal contact with\nGordan\nand\nNoether\n. In Paris,\nCamille Jordan\ngave a dinner for Study and\nHilbert\nto which\nGeorge-Henri Halphen\n,\nAmÃ©dÃ©e Mannheim\nand\nGaston Darboux\nwere invited. On this occasion the French mathematicians all spoke German out of politeness to their German guests who complained to\nKlein\nafterwards that the mathematical conversation had been very superficial. They were also disappointed with their meeting with\nPierre Bonnet\nwhom they felt was too old for mathematical discussions. The mathematician with whom they seemed to get on best was\nCharles Hermite\n. Although they considered him very old\n(\nhe was\n64)\n, he was \"extraordinarily friendly and hospitable\" and discussed the big problems of invariant theory which interested Study. Since they had found their visit especially useful, they returned to\nHermite\n's home for a second visit a few days later. Study returned to Germany and reported in person to\nKlein\nabout his Paris visit. However,\nKlein\nwas disappointed that Study did not speak as much about mathematics as he had expected.\nBack at Leipzig, Study\nhabilitated\nand gave various lecture courses:\nEinleitung in die analytische Geometrie der Ebene und des Raumes\nâ\n(\nIntroduction to the analytic geometry of the plane and space\n)\n(\nSummer semester\n1886)\n;\nEinfÃ¼hrung in die Theorie der WÃ¤rmeleitung, in Verbindung mit der Theorie der Fourier'schen Reihen und Fourier'schen Integrale\nâ\n(\nIntroduction to the theory of heat conduction, in conjunction with the theory of Fourier series and Fourier integrals\n)\n(\nWinter semester\n1886)\n;\nEinleitung in die neuere Algebra und deren geometrische Anwendungen\nâ\n(\nIntroduction into modern algebra and their geometric applications\n)\n(\nSummer semester\n1887)\n;\nEinleitung in die Ausdehnungslehre und Quaternionentheorie\nâ\n(\nIntroduction to the theory of extension and quaternions\n)\n(\nSummer semester\n1887)\n;\nNeuere Algebra\nâ\n(\nNewer algebra\n)\n(\nWinter semester\n1887)\n;\nMechanische Theorie der WÃ¤rme\nâ\n(\nMechanical theory of heat\n)\n(\nWinter semester\n1887)\n; and\nPrincipien der Mathematik\n(\nZahlbegriff und geometrische Axiome\n)\nfÃ¼r Fortgeschrittenere\nâ\n(\nPrinciples of mathematics\n(\nconcept of number and geometric axioms\n)\nfor more advanced students\n)\n(\nSummer semester\n1888)\n. Study spent a month, from\n15\nJanuary\n1887\nto\n15\nFebruary\n1887\n, at Erlangen where he had discussions with\nGordan\n. This was at\nKlein\n's suggestion but this time Study was keen to go. He wanted to get to know\nGordan\npersonally and at Erlangen he had many useful discussions with him. Study, who seems to have got on with\nGordan\nextremely well, wrote in letters to\nKlein\nand to\nFriedrich Engel\n:-\nOf course, I first visited Professor\nGordan\n, who showed me the greatest kindness and devotion. I am with him for several hours every day\n(\nprobably this is possible due to the small number of students here\n)\n. He talks to me on mathematical matters which I find very stimulating and helpful. I am fortunate that I have learned sufficient to be able to follow him. His kindness goes so far as to hold lectures on advanced topics just for me. I have learnt much, even things that I can use in my current research. ... He is one of the cleverest people I have ever met - he is deep, thorough and clear like nobody else I have ever met.  ... He is a very amiable man who treated me in the kindest possible way and I am most grateful to him.\nStudy had first met\nEngel\nin July\n1885\njust after he had returned from a ten month visit to\nSophus Lie\nin Oslo. From that time on, Study corresponded with both\nEngel\nand\nLie\nconcerning his mathematical results. Study's father died in\n1888\nafter a long illness. This meant that he inherited enough money to allow him to marry. Soon after his father's death he married his cousin Lina von Langsdorff; they had only one child, a daughter Trude\n(\nborn\n26\nJune\n1889)\n.\nIn July\n1888\n, Study left Leipzig and moved to the University of Marburg where he became a\nprivatdocent\n. His move to Marburg was an attempt to push his career forward more quickly, believing that he would have better opportunities at a Prussian university. He published his first book\nMethoden zur Theorie der ternÃ¤ren Formen\nâ\n(\nMethods to the theory of ternary forms\n)\nin September\n1889\n.\nGian-Carlo Rota\nwrote in his introduction to the\n1982\nreprint of Study's\n1889\noriginal book:-\n... the flamboyant German style and the scattered remarks, often sparkling and original, make the reading enjoyable, and the deciphering of the two examples of irrational invariants will be a test of the reader's understanding of the vagaries of the invariant-theoretic mind. ... The reader will miss in Study's book\nElliott\n's philatelic detail,\nCapelli\n's combinatorial skill,\nHilbert\n's and\nAlfred Young\n's steam-rolling genius, but will find instead a breadth of conceptual view and philosophical insight that displays Continental mathematical thought in its finest hour.\nStudy became more and more unhappy at Marburg. He only had two or three students attend his lectures and his colleagues did not fare any better. This led to a degree of rivalry between Study and the other lecturers and he came to dislike the lecturing side of his job. The only colleague with whom he got on well was\nHeinrich Weber\nbut in\n1892\nWeber\nleft Marburg when he was appointed to the University of GÃ¶ttingen. Around this time, however, Study began work on writing a book on spherical trigonometry having already published the paper\nÃber die sphÃ¤rische Trigonometrie\nâ\n(\nOn spherical trigonometry\n)\nin\n1891\n. The book\nSphÃ¤rische Trigonometrie, orthogonale Substitutionen und elliptische Functionen. Eine analytisch-geometrische Untersuchung\nâ\n(\nSpherical trigonometry, orthogonal substitutions and elliptic functions. An analytical-geometric investigation\n)\nwas published in\n1893\n. In July\n1893\nhe visited the United States where he attended the mathematical conference at the Columbian Exposition in Chicago in August\n1893\nand then went to Evanston to attend\nKlein\n's series of lectures on contemporary mathematical research held from\n28\nAugust to\n9\nSeptember\n1893\n. After this he went to Johns Hopkins University where\nFabian Franklin\narranged for him to receive $\n250\nfor giving three lectures on invariant theory. While in the United States he published a paper in English, namely\nOn the addition theorems of Jacobi and Weierstrass\nin the\nAmerican Journal of Mathematics\n. While he was in America he received a letter from\nEngel\ntelling him that a professorship in Bonn had been advertised. Study was interested but not confident that he would be a strong applicant. He wrote:-\nIt will probably be a sham, I have no more hope.\nDespite his pessimism, two months later he would be appointed to the professorship at Bonn. He left America on\n25\nApril\n1894\nhaving first visited\nJ Willard Gibbs\nat New Haven, Connecticut,\nSimon Newcomb\nin Washington, and\nHenry Fine\nat Princeton. On his return to Germany in April\n1894\nhe was appointed extraordinary professor of mathematics at Bonn. However, at Bonn he found that he was not receiving much more in salary than he had in Marburg but found Bonn a much more expensive place to live. Again Study was to move after three years, this time to a full professorship at Greifswald. In\n1904\nhe made his final move when he accepted the chair at the University of Bonn which had been left vacant on the death of\nRudolf Lipschitz\nin October\n1903\n. Study held the chair at Bonn until he retired in\n1927\n.\nStudy became a leader in the geometry of complex numbers. He reformulated, independently of\nFrancesco Severi\n, the fundamental principles of enumerative geometry due to\nHermann Schubert\n. He also worked on invariant theory helping to develop a symbolic notation. In\n1923\nhe proved important theorems on real and complex algebras of low dimension publishing these results. Study's contribution is summarised by W Burau in\n[\n1\n]\nas follows:-\n... Study demonstrated what he considered to be a thorough treatment of a problem. ... With\nCorrado Segre\n, Study was one of the leading pioneers in the geometry of complex numbers. ... Adept in the methods of invariant theory ... Study, employing the identities of the theory, sought to demonstrate that geometric theorems are independent of coordinates. ... Study was the first to investigate systematically all algebras possessing up to four generators over\nR\n\\mathbb{R}\nR\nand\nC\n\\mathbb{C}\nC\n.\nOther areas which Study worked on were straight lines in elliptic space, with his student at Bonn\nJ L Coolidge\n, and he simplified the method of differential operators. In\n1903\nhe published\nGeometrie der Dynamen\nwhich considered euclidean kinematics and the mechanics of rigid bodies. In\n[\n1\n]\nthe impact of\nGeometrie der Dynamen\nis described:-\nUnfortunately, because of its awkward style and surfeit of new concepts, this work has never found the public it merits.\nStudy remained in Bonn after his retirement at the end of the summer semester of\n1927\n, being made professor emeritus at this time. He died of stomach cancer three years later. He was cremated on\n9\nJanuary\n1930\nand the urn with his ashes was buried in the Poppelsdorf cemetery in Bonn.\nOne final fact about Study is of interest. He had always been interested in biology from his student days and one of the ways that he continued this interest through his life was by having an impressive collection of butterflies."
