  "biografia": "Max Deuring\n's parents were liberally minded people as is evident from the fact that they were subscribers to the liberal GÃ¶ttingen newspaper until the Nazi party came to power in\n1933\nand closed the paper down. Max was brought up in GÃ¶ttingen completing his school education at the Oberrealschule there. In\n1926\nhe entered the University of GÃ¶ttingen where he studied mathematics and physics. Apart from the winter semester of\n1928\n/\n29\nwhich he spent in Rome, his university studies were completely undertaken at GÃ¶ttingen. His interests were in number theory, and at the this time\nHilbert\n's ideas dominated the area but new ideas were flourishing, particularly driven by\nEmmy Noether\n's new algebraic approach.\nDeuring was captivated by the new approach to algebra which\nEmmy Noether\nwas developing at GÃ¶ttingen and, from\n1927\non, she advised him on the research for his doctorate. He submitted his doctoral dissertation\nArithmetische Theorie der algebraischen Funktionen\nâ\n(\nArithmetic theory of algebraic functions\n)\nin\n1930\n, the degree being conferred in the following year. One of the great strengths shown by Deuring at this stage, and throughout his career, was an ability to make simplifications and generalisations to existing work. For example in his first paper\nVerzweigungstheorie bewerteter KÃ¶rper\nâ\n(\nThe bifurcation theory of valuation fields\n)\n(1931)\nhe generalised\nHilbert\n's theory of prime divisors in\nGalois\nextensions to more general abstract fields. Again his ability to simplify proofs and gain better understanding with his knowledge of class field theory is shown in his second paper published in\n1931\nZur Theorie der Normen Relativzyklischer KÃ¶rper\nâ\n(\nOn the theory of standard relatively cyclic fields\n)\n.\nBartel van der Waerden\nhad also undertaken research at GÃ¶ttingen. He was four years older than Deuring but the two had become friends, both being part of the circle of young mathematicians around\nEmmy Noether\n. After short spells at the University of Rostock and the University of Groningen,\nvan der Waerden\nhad been appointed professor of mathematics at the University of Leipzig in\n1931\nand Deuring was appointed as his assistant. By\n1935\n, with an excellent publication record behind him, including his famous book\nAlgebren\nâ\n(\nAlgebras\n)\npublished in that year, Deuring wanted to qualify as a lecturer and submit his\nhabilitation\nthesis. He would have liked to become a lecturer at Leipzig but he was aware that this route was blocked for political motives.\nHelmut Hasse\nwas by this time director of the Mathematical Institute at GÃ¶ttingen and he encouraged Deuring to\nhabilitate\nthere. However, Erhard Tornier, a staunch Nazi supporter, although accepting the quality of Deuring's work, nevertheless found him politically unacceptable. Tornier was supported by militant Nazi sympathisers among the students, and Deuring was refused the right to lecture by the Ministry. He remained at Leipzig but was not qualified to lecture.\nPerhaps Deuring's greatest mathematical idea came in\n1936\n. We will look below at these impressive contributions. However before that we will follow the rest of Deuring's career. In\n1937\nhe was allowed to proceed with his career at the University of Jena. After six years in Jena, he was appointed as an extraordinary professor at the University of Posen in\n1943\n. This was not the most attractive of appointments for Deuring since the University of Posen had been set up by the Nazis in PoznÃ¡n, Poland. The university had opened in February\n1940\nin the territory annexed from Poland at the start of World War II, only offering economics and political science when it first opened. Deuring remained in PoznÃ¡n until the end of the war when he returned to his home town of GÃ¶ttingen. In\n1947\nhe was appointed to Marburg then, in the following year, to the University of Hamburg.\nHerglotz\nhad held a chair at GÃ¶ttingen until he was forced to resign due to ill health in\n1946\n. The chair remained unfilled until\n1950\nwhen Deuring was appointed. He continued to hold this chair until\n1976\nwhen he retired and was made professor emeritus.\nHasse\nproved in\n1932\nan analogue of the\nRiemann\nhypothesis for the\nzeta function\nassociated with an elliptic curve over a finite field. Deuring's 'greatest mathematical idea' which we referred to above was an idea on how to generalise\nHasse\n's result but to do this he had to introduce a radically new approach. Deuring was in Leipzig in\n1936\n, having failed to be accepted at GÃ¶ttingen in the previous year as we explained above. He wrote to\nHasse\non\n9\nMay\n(\nsee for example\n[\n6\n]\n)\n:-\nIn the last few weeks, I have tried to generalize your results for\nelliptic function\nfields to fields of higher genus. I have succeeded in doing so, all the way to the construction of the ring of multipliers and the proof that it is algebraic. Since you may already be further ahead in these questions, I enclose the introduction to a projected paper. There the algebraic results are only stated. I have complete proofs of them; but they are still monstrous.\nWhat Deuring had found was a way to approach extending\nHasse\n's results from curves of genus\n1\n, the elliptic curves, to curves of higher genus. It involved his algebraic theory of correspondences.\nHasse\nwas impressed and replied to Deuring\n[\n6\n]\n:-\n... At any rate, I am sure that you have laid the ground for coming to terms with the\nRiemann\nhypothesis in arbitrary function fields. I am convinced that I will be able to give a proof of the\nRiemann\nhypothesis by linking my own approaches, which I have thought about these past weeks, with your results. I will think this over as soon as possible, also with a view to smoothing out your proofs.\nIn fact it was neither\nHasse\nnor Deuring who finally proved the result which both were trying to obtain. However Deuring presented his new ideas on the algebraic theory of correspondences in two papers, both of which were published by\nCrelle\n's journal. The first part of\nArithmetische Theorie der Korrespondenzen algebraischer FunktionenkÃ¶rper\nâ\n(\nArithmetic theory of correspondences of algebraic function fields\n)\nappeared in\n1937\n, the second part in\n1940\n. The generalisation of the\nRiemann\nhypothesis to function fields of arbitrary genus was first achieved by AndrÃ©\nWeil\nin\n1948\n, but he did so using Deuring's theory of correspondences. The result was first published in\nWeil\n's book\nSur les courbes algÃ©briques et les variÃ©tÃ©s qui s'en dÃ©duisent\nâ\n(\nOn algebraic curves and derived varieties\n)\n.\nIn\n1937\nDeuring wrote the following in the introduction to\nOn\nEpstein\n's zeta function\nwhich shows how deeply he was attacking problems of zeta functions:-\nIt is the purpose of this note to present some formulae which connect the zeta functions of quadratic forms or\nEpstein\n's zeta-functions to the\nRiemann\nzeta-function and functions related to it. Although these formulae did not yield any new results concerning deeper questions on zeta-functions, I nevertheless believe them of sufficient interest and hope that they will be of use in further investigations.\nDeuring continued to produce important papers. In\n1941\nin\nDie Typen der Multiplikatorenringe elliptischer FunktionenkÃ¶rper\nâ\n(\nThe types of multiplicative rings of elliptic function fields\n)\nhe classified endomorphism rings of elliptic function fields having laid some of the groundwork in his paper\nInvarianten und Normalformen elliptischer FunktionenkÃ¶rper\nâ\n(\nInvariants and normal forms of elliptic function fields\n)\n. A paper of\n1942\nis described by Roquette\n(\nwho was a student of Deuring during his time in Hamburg\n)\nin\n[\n4\n]\n:-\nOn several occasions in the work of\nHasse\nand Deuring, there appeared a situation which today we would call \"good reduction\" of algebraic function fields or curves. In his paper 'Reduktion algebraischer FunktionenkÃ¶rper nach Primdivisoren des KonstantenkÃ¶rpers'\nâ\n(\nAlgebraically reduced function fields after prime divisors of the field of constants\n)\nDeuring developed a coherent general theory of good reduction which covered all special cases which were encountered so far. Although this paper appeared one year later than the\n1941\npaper on endomorphism rings, it was completed earlier, and Deuring used it in an essential way in his study on endomorphism rings.\nDuring his years at GÃ¶ttingen, Deuring made many trips abroad but had two longer visits, one to the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, the other at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research in Bombay, India, in\n1958\n. On this second visit he gave a series of lectures which were published as\nLectures on the theory of algebraic functions of one variable\nin\n1973\n. As a reviewer states:-\nOne expects the best from this author and he gives no less in these lectures.\nWe should note that the paper\n[\n2\n]\ncontains a list of\n25\ndoctoral students advised by Deuring.\nHe was honoured with election to a number of academies such as the Academy of Sciences and Literature in Mainz, the\nGÃ¶ttingen Academy of Sciences\n, and the\nGerman Academy of Natural Scientists Leopoldina\n."
