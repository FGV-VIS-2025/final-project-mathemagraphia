  "biografia": "Franz Rellich\nwas born in Tramin, South Tirol, which, at that time was part of Austria. The village is now in Italy\n(\nthe South Tirol was ceded to Italy in the Treaty of Saint Germain in\n1919\nfollowing World War I\n)\nwith its Italian name of Termeno. Rellich entered the\nGymnasium\nin Graz in\n1916\n, studying there until\n1924\n. After graduating from the Gymnasium, he entered the University of Graz in\n1924\nwhere he studied mathematics and physics before moving to the Georg-August University of GÃ¶ttingen in\n1926\n. There he joined a close-knit circle of young mathematicians and physicists, some employed as assistants and some as\nprivatdozents\nin the new Mathematical Institute. He undertook research for his doctorate with\nRichard Courant\nas his advisor and, in\n1929\n, he was awarded the degree for his thesis\nVerallgemeinerung der Riemannschen Integrationsmethode auf Differentialgleichungen n-ter Ordnung in zwei VerÃ¤nderlichen\nâ\n(\nGeneralization of  Riemann's integration method for differential equations of the n-th order in two variables\n)\n. In this dissertation he generalised the\nRiemann\n's integration method, namely the explicit representation of the solution of the initial value problem of a linear hyperbolic differential equation of second order, to the case of such equations any order.\nCourant\nwas able to write in Rellich's obituary with great authority about his time as a research student in GÃ¶tttingen\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nRellich's unique charm opened all hearts to him, his originality and his passionate interest in science made him a worthy partner\n[\nof the young mathematicians and physicists\n]\nas well as of the older members of this group. The vitality of this young generation at GÃ¶ttingen seemed to justify the expectation of continuity and stability of the Institute so that GÃ¶ttingen's mathematical-physical tradition was assured.\nOf course the Nazi party destroyed the remarkable mathematical school at GÃ¶ttingen but, before we look at how Rellich was affected by this, we need to explain his connection with that outstanding mathematician\nvan der Waerden\n. In\n1924\nvan der Waerden\nhad spent seven months in GÃ¶ttingen but he returned there as a visiting professor in\n1929\n. In July of that year he met Camilla Rellich, Franz Rellich's sister, and they married in September\n1929\n. Rellich and\nvan der Waerden\n, therefore, became brothers-in-law during the time Rellich was completing his doctorate. As well as being\nCourant\n's student, Rellich was also his assistant at GÃ¶ttingen, and he\nhabilitated\nthere in\n1933\n. He had gone to Hamburg in the previous year where he lectured on differential and integral calculus. However,\n1933\nwas a highly significant year for German politics since the Nazis came to power after the elections of March in that year. Rellich was a staunch opponent of National Socialism and, as a consequence, he suffered considerable problems throughout the early part of his academic career.\nHermann Weyl\nheld the chair of mathematics at GÃ¶ttingen from\n1930\nhaving succeeded to\nHilbert\n's chair. However, after the Nazis came to power,\nWeyl\nresigned his chair and accepted a position at the newly formed Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton in the United States. Segal explains the events that followed\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nAfter\nWeyl\n's resignation\n[\nfrom GÃ¶ttingen\n]\n, his former assistant, Franz Rellich, became Institute Director ... Rellich had only a low-level appointment and ... was not an established figure ... There was need for a prominent mathematical figure who was suitable politically to take over the leadership in Gottingen. Furthermore, in mid-December, Rellich was ordered to report on January\n7\nfor ten weeks to a field-sports camp near Berlin. This was, in fact, a mistake, since Rellich, as an Austrian citizen, was not subject to such forced training regimens. When he arrived at the camp, he was not admitted on these grounds. However, on December\n27\n, the Curator had, after some hesitation, replaced Rellich with Werner Weber as acting director of the Mathematical Institute. Rellich himself would lose his position at Gottingen six months later, on June\n18\n.\nDuring the years\n1933\n-\n34\nat  GÃ¶ttingen, Rellich has taught courses on\nIntegral Equations and Spectral Theory\n(1933)\nand\nPartial Differential Equations\n(1934)\n. He had also run a seminar on\nOperator Theory\nin\n1933\n-\n34\nand one on\nSpectral Theory\nin\n1934\n. He had published significant papers such as\nZur ersten Randwertaufgabe bei Monge-AmpÃ¨reschen Differentialgleichungen vom elliptischen Typus; differentialgeometrische Anwendungen\nâ\n(\nThe first boundary value problem for Monge-Ampere equations of elliptic type; differential geometric applications\n)\n(1932)\n,\nÃber die Reduktion gewisser ausgearteter Systeme von partiellen Differentialgleichungen\nâ\n(\nOn the reduction of certain degenerate systems of partial differential equations\n)\n(1934)\nand\nSpektraltheorie in nichtseparablen RÃ¤umen\nâ\n(\nSpectral theory in non-separable spaces\n)\n(1934)\n. Despite producing outstanding mathematics,\nOswald TeichmÃ¼ller\nand Erhard Tornier\n(1894\n-\n1982)\nconsidered Rellich part of the '\nCourant\nclique' at GÃ¶ttingen and, for that political\n(\nor, perhaps more accurately, racist\n)\nreason, had driven him out.\nAfter being dismissed from GÃ¶ttingen, Rellich was appointed as a privatdozent at the University of Marburg in\n1934\n. He remained there until\n1942\nwhen he was appointed to a chair of mathematics at the University of Dresden. In September\n1945\nhe was appointed to represent\nCarl Siegel\n's chair -\nSiegel\nhad left Germany in\n1940\nfeeling that he could no longer remain in his native land once the Nazis were in power. He worked at Princeton, accepting a permanent position there in\n1946\n. In that year Rellich was appointed to a full Professorship to fill\nSiegel\n's chair.\nCourant\nexplains the important role that Rellich played in restoring GÃ¶ttingen to a world-class mathematical centre\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nWhen he took over the leadership of the Mathematics Institute in GÃ¶ttingen after its collapse, he, like no one else, was capable of building again something of the old tradition from the ashes. The dedication and selflessness with which he undertook the task is a shining example of the forces to which Germany owes its resurgence after the disaster. ... As director of the Mathematical Institute Rellich was deeply interested in creating a wide, stable base for scientific development. He succeeded in securing GÃ¶ttingen's path for the foreseeable future.\nRellich made many important research contributions, particularly significant being his work on perturbation theory of linear operators on a\nHilbert space\n. Like much of Rellich's work, this was an abstract piece of mathematics motivated by questions in physics. In this particular case it was inspired by applications to quantum mechanics. Another piece of work which brought him international recognition was his study of the\nMonge\n-\nAmpÃ¨re\ndifferential equation of elliptic type which we already mentioned when we looked at his papers published in the period\n1932\n-\n34\n. He is also known for Rellich's theorem on entire solutions of differential equations which he proved in\n1940\n.\nA mark of the importance of his work is the fact that several of the lecture courses that he gave in the\n1950\ns were published in the\n1960\ns and\n1970\ns. For example, he gave the course\nPerturbation Theory of Eigenvalue Problems\nat New York University in\n1953\nand this was published in\n1969\n, with a Preface by Jacob T Schwartz. Here is a quote from that Preface:-\nThe present notes, taken from lectures given by Professor Rellich at New York University in\n1953\n, describe an area which he pioneered, and in which some of his most striking mathematical work was done. They show the fruitful interplay, characteristic for Rellich, of abstract operator theory with penetrating investigations of significant particular examples. In reading these notes, one comes to exceptionally close witness of the mathematical mind in the act of creation.\nA course which Rellich delivered at GÃ¶ttingen in the winter semester of\n1952\n-\n53\n,\nEigenwerttheorie partieller Differentialgleichungen\nâ\n(\nEigenvalue theory of partial differential equations\n)\n, formed a major part of the book\nEigenwerttheorie gewÃ¶hnlicher Differentialgleichungen\nâ\n(\nEigenvalue theory of ordinary differential equations\n)\npublished in\n1976\n. The additional material in the book is written by Konrad JÃ¶rgens, who studied for his doctorate in GÃ¶ttingen advised by Rellich around the time he gave the course. While we are mentioning Rellich's students, we must record that\nJÃ¼rgen Moser\nwas one of Rellich's students. He received his doctorate from GÃ¶ttingen in\n1952\nfor his thesis\nStÃ¶rungstheorie des kontinuierlichen Spektrums fÃ¼r gewÃ¶hnliche Differentialgleichungen zweiter Ordnung\nâ\n(\nPerturbation theory of the continuous spectrum for ordinary differential equations of the second order\n)\n."
