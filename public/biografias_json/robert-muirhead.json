  "biografia": "Robert Muirhead\n's father was Andrew Muirhead\n(\nborn in Pollockshaws, Renfrew,\n31\nDecember\n1823)\nwho was a leather merchant. Robert's mother was Isabella Florence Reid\n(\nborn in Irvine, Ayrshire,\n12\nApril\n1828)\n. Andrew and Isabella Muirhead were married in Irvine, Ayrshire, on\n13\nMarch\n1841\n. Robert Franklin Muirhead\n(\nknown as Bob\n)\nhad three older siblings: Mary Jane\n(\nborn\n5\nFebruary\n1854)\n, Elizabeth Ann\n(\nborn\n22\nJanuary\n1856)\n, James Andrew Arthur\n(\nborn\n14\nJanuary\n1858)\nand six younger siblings: Henry Alfred\n(\nborn\n3\nJanuary\n1862)\n, Isabella Jessie\n(\nborn\n17\nJanuary\n1864)\n, Alice Margaret\n(\nborn\n10\nMarch\n1866)\n, Roland Eugene\n(\nborn\n24\nJuly\n1868)\n, Florence Ellen\n(\nborn\n1\nAugust\n1870)\nand Arthur Montgomery\n(\nborn\n24\nApril\n1873)\n. We note that Andrew and Isabella's first child, omitted from our list, was Ann Jane who was born on\n29\nMay\n1852\nbut died in September of the following year.\nAndrew Muirhead\n[\n8\n]\n:-\n... was a successful tanner and leather merchant in Glasgow. He himself was a fourth generation member of a family that had been involved in tanning leather since\n1758\nwhen his grandfather's uncle, John Muirhead, founded a tannery in partnership with Sir John Stirling Maxwell which produced glove leathers which he exported to the colonies in North America.\nAndrew Muirhead purchased the Burnside Tannery from his father James Muirhead in\n1840\n. Situated on the banks of the river Cart at Pollokshaws, it was purchased compulsorily by the Glasgow and South West Railway Company in\n1870\n. In the same year Andrew Muirhead purchased the Burngill Tannery in Bridge of Weir from the City of Glasgow Bank on\n15\nMay\n1870\nand renamed it the Gryffe Tannery. The Muirhead family home was at Meikle Cloak, near Lochwinnoch, and it was there that Robert Franklin Muirhead, the subject of this biography, was brought up. His primary education was partly by private tutors in his home and partly at the local village school. When he was twelve years old, in\n1872\n, he began his secondary education at Hamilton Academy. This was the year in which the Education\n(\nScotland\n)\nAct came into force, describing the school as a 'higher-class school'. After studying for a year at Hamilton Academy, he went to Paisley Grammar School in\n1873\nand, in\n1875\nhe graduated as dux of the School. This School has a long history dating back to its\n16\nth century Royal Charter foundation, but when Muirhead studied there it consisted of two buildings, one dating from\n1801\nand a new building beside it opened in\n1864\n.\nIn\n1876\n, still only sixteen years old, Muirhead began his studies at Glasgow University. Although being only sixteen sounds very young by today's standards, in fact at this time many went when they were even younger. For example,\nJohn Dougall\nwas only fourteen when he began his studies at the University of Glasgow in\n1881\n, being awarded his degree in\n1886\n. He was taught by Muirhead and writes that\n[\n3\n]\n:-\n...\n[\nMuirhead\n]\nconducted supplementary classes at Glasgow University both for pass and for honours men. The present writer well remembers his lectures at this period on Theory of Equations, and on Electrostatics, and can vouch for the high quality of his teaching of these subjects. The friendship thus formed continued unbroken throughout Muirhead's life. A truer and more helpful friend no one could possibly have.\nWhile he was still an undergraduate, Muirhead became a member of the Royal Philosophical Society of Glasgow in\n1879\n. He published the paper\nOn a Substitute for Euclid's Third Postulate\nin the\nProceedings of the Royal Philosophical Society of Glasgow\nin\n1880\n. In the same year he was appointed the Society's delegate to the meeting of the\nBritish Association for the Advancement of Science\nheld in Swansea in August-September. He reported back to the Royal Philosophical Society of Glasgow and his report was published in the Society's\nProceedings\n.\nMuirhead graduated with a B.Sc. from the University of Glasgow in\n1879\nand with an M.A. in\n1881\n, with the highest honours in mathematics and natural philosophy\n(\nphysics\n)\n. He was one of five students who graduated with an M.A. with Honours in Mathematics and Natural Philosophy in that year, two with First Class Honours and three with Second Class Honours. Muirhead and\nAlexander Russell\nwere the two First Class students. The professor of mathematics was\nHugh Blackburn\nwhen Muirhead began his studies but, from\n1879\n, it was\nWilliam Jack\n. The professor of Natural Philosophy was\nWilliam Thomson\nwith\nAndrew Gray\nas his assistant. Muirhead was awarded a Ferguson Scholarship, which was open to all graduates from the four Scottish universities\n(\nthere were only four at this time\n)\n. He was also awarded a George A Clark Scholarship which funded him for four years at the University of Cambridge.\nOn\n12\nJune\n1881\nMuirhead was admitted as a pensioner at St Catharine's College, University of Cambridge. Being a pensioner means that he paid for his own tuition. He matriculated at the start of the Michaelmas term of\n1881\n(\nat the beginning of October\n)\n. At this time\nArthur Cayley\nwas the Sadleirian professor of Pure Mathematics and\nJohn William Strutt\nwas the Cavendish Professor of Physics. In\n1884\nJ J Thomson became the Cavendish Professor of Physics.\nWilliam Henry Young\nwas studying the mathematical tripos in the same years as Muirhead, having also matriculated in\n1881\n. Muirhead graduated M.A. in\n1884\nas\n19\nth Wrangler and was\n1\nst class in Part III of the mathematical tripos in\n1885\n. He then spent the year\n1885\n-\n86\nat the University of GÃ¶ttingen where he attended the lectures of\nHermann Schwarz\n.\nIn\n1886\nhe submitted his essay\nLaws of motion\nfor the University of Cambridge Smith's Prize. It was awarded the second Smith's Prize and J J Thomson sent the essay to\nThe London, Edinburgh, and Dublin Philosophical Magazine and Journal of Science\n: it was published in\n1887\n. You can read a version of this prize winning essay at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nWe need at this point say a little about Muirhead's political views. When an undergraduate at Glasgow, he was influenced by Edward Caird\n(1835\n-\n1908)\nwho was the Professor of Moral Philosophy. Caird was part of the idealist movement and a strong supporter of women's education. Caird in turn influenced James Mavor\n(1854\n-\n1925)\n, who was one of his students, and became a social reformer. Mavor was a signature on the Manifesto of the Socialist League in December\n1884\nand became the Scottish chairman. Muirhead joined the Socialist Land and Labour League and the Socialist League in\n1886\n. Let us note at this stage that Muirhead was not the only member of his family to be active politically: his sister Alice was a suffragist and his brother Roland was a notable left-wing Scottish nationalist who became the first president of the National Party of Scotland. Muirhead was sympathetic to all these views and, together with his brother Roland, he organised a visit by the Russian 'Anarchist Prince', Pyotr Alexeyevich Kropotkin, to Glasgow in November\n1886\n. Kropotkin addressed the local branch of the Socialist League, delivering the speech 'Socialism: Its Growing Force and Final Aim' on\n27\nNovember\n[\n6\n]\n:-\nAfter the\n1886\nvisit to Glasgow of Peter Kropotkin and with the established anarchist propaganda continuing in the city, the local branch of the Socialist League became much more ardently anarchist than merely anti-parliamentarian. This much was noted by William Morris himself in his diary when he commented, 'Kropotkin's visit has turned them a little in the Anarchist direction, which gives them an agreeable air of toleration'.\nMuirhead writes\n[\n9\n]\n:-\nIt was in\n1886\nwhen I first met Edward Carpenter, who was giving some lectures in Glasgow for the Glasgow Branch of the Socialist League, of which I was a member. I had read with delight 'England's Ideal' and was not disappointed when I met its author. He was my guest\n(\nat my lodgings,\n22\nArlington Street\n)\non that occasion, and the friendship he and I formed then was never interrupted.\nFor a version of the whole of Muirhead's article\n[\n9\n]\n, see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nEdward Carpenter\n(1844\n-\n1929)\nwas a poet, socialist, philosopher and a strong supporter for gay rights. He left an early career in the Church, became a lecturer teaching many subjects including mathematics and astronomy but gave this up after inheriting a large sum of money in\n1882\n. Influenced by Karl Marx, he became more involved in various socialist societies. Carpenter and Muirhead were together at 'Bloody Sunday' which took place in London on\n13\nNovember\n1887\n. The protest, organised by the Social Democratic Federation and the Irish National League, was against unemployment and \"Coercion Acts\" which saw many Irish imprisoned. Carpenter writes\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nI saw my friend Robert Muirhead seized by the collar by a mounted man and dragged along, apparently towards a police station, while a bobby on foot aided in the arrest. I jumped to the rescue and slanged the two constables, for which I got a whack on the cheek-bone from a baton, but Muirhead was released.\nMuirhead writes\n[\n9\n]\n:-\nFrom year to year I paid visits of a few days or a week to Millthorpe\n[\nCarpenter's home\n]\n... There I met and formed friendships with a number of the Sheffield Socialists, as well as others from a distance ... There also I met Dr Cecil Reddie and a project was mooted to start a new school on more or less Socialist lines with Reddie as head master and with the co-operation of Carpenter and myself and possibly others.\nThe school, called Abbotsholme, in Rocester, Staffordshire opened in\n1889\nwith Reddie as head master and Muirhead as one of the teachers. There was a disagreement on the principles on which the school should operate and, after a year, Muirhead left. For more details see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nOn a visit to Carpenter's home, Muirhead met Olive Schreiner\n(1855\n-\n1920)\n. Schreiner was an author, promotor of women's rights, and a strong anti-war campaigner. From that time on, Schreiner became close friends with Muirhead, and Carpenter.\nIn\n1891\nMuirhead became a lecturer on Mathematics in the Mason College, Birmingham. This college had been founded in\n1875\nand, in\n1900\n, it was incorporated into the University of Birmingham. He married Emily Caroline Hurndall\n(\nknown as Linnie\n)\nin\n1893\nin King's Norton, Worcestershire, England. Linnie was born in Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire England in\n1869\n. They met while Robert Franklin Muirhead was teaching in Birmingham where Linnie was living at the time. She was a violin teacher. The wedding was conducted in a secular marriage ceremony; in\n[\n9\n]\nthere is a copy of a letter that the Muirhead wrote to his future mother-in-law explaining why he wanted a secular marriage ceremony. They had four children Waldo Hurndall Muirhead\n(\nborn\n11\nNovember\n1894)\n, Ronald Hurndall Muirhead\n(\nborn\n29\nJune\n1899)\n, Ruth Hurndall Muirhead\n(\nborn\n9\nNovember\n1900)\nand Joyce Hurndall Muirhead\n(\nborn\n1905)\n.\nMuirhead and his wife left Birmingham in\n1893\nand returned to Scotland where he became a tutor in Edinburgh. He became an active member of the\nEdinburgh Mathematical Society\n, being elected a member in February\n1894\n. He presented his first paper to the Society at its June\n1894\nmeeting in Edinburgh, its title being\nE Carpenter's proof of Taylor's theorem\n. The paper begins:-\nThe idea of the following proof was communicated to me some years ago by Mr Edward Carpenter of Millthorpe, Derbyshire, formerly Fellow of Trinity Hall, Cambridge; who remarked that it seemed to afford a demonstration of\nTaylor\n's Theorem which came very naturally and directly from the definition of a differential coefficient. The chief difficulty seemed to arise in dealing with the negligible small quantities which are produced in great numbers. However, I found it not difficult to complete the proof for the case whenÂ allÂ the successive differential coefficients ofÂ f\n(\nx\n)\nare finite and continuous. It occurred to me lately that this proof might interest the Society: and it is here given with the addition of a modified proof leading to an expansion in m terms with a remainder.\nThis was the first of\n45\npapers which Muirhead presented to the Society over the following years.\nAround this time Muirhead was interested in a job with\nThomas Muir\nin South Africa and must have asked Olive Schreiner about the possibilities for, on\n17\nSeptember\n1894\n, she wrote to him from Kimberley, North Cape\n[\n15\n]\n:-\nYou write to a person and give \"Edinburgh\" as your only address. HowÂ is a body to get a letter to you so I'm sending this to our E.C.\n[\nEdward Carpenter\n]\nI'm afraid there's no chance\nMuir\nwill be able to give you workÂ out here; there's such a wrong and foolish outcry about his fillingÂ all teaching posts with Scotchmen.Â If you could come out it would be splendid.\nIn\n[\n15\n]\nthere is an overview of letters between Muirhead and Olive Schreiner:-\nWhen Schreiner first returned to South Africa, she wrote urging him to come out too, then actively discouraged him - he would not be able to cope with realities for working men there in roughing it, but then suggests that he might work at her friend Mr Lloyd's new school. Throughout these letters, the Edward Carpenter shared connection was clearly an important one and is referred to in the later letters as well as the earlier. Comments on nature and landscape also feature strongly.\nThat Muirhead was interested in 'nature and landscape' is supported by the fact that he was a member of the Co-operative Holidays Association which was founded in\n1893\n. It\n[\n16\n]\n:-\n... was not simply a holiday club but a voluntary leisure organisation committed to the promotion of specific cultural values ... grounded upon the concept of the countryside as not only a physical but also a cultural and spiritual alternative to the city and industrial materialism.\nIn March\n1895\nMuirhead moved from\n59\nWarrender Park Road, Edinburgh, Scotland to Bridge of Weir, Glasgow, Scotland. He now started writing numerous mathematical papers, having ten published in the two years\n1895\nand\n1896\n. For a list of Muirhead's papers, see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nHis most famous paper was I\nnequalities relating to some algebraic means\n(1901)\nin which he described what today is known as 'Muirhead's Inequality'. This is a generalisation of the geometric mean and arithmetic mean inequalities as the Introduction states:-\nThe fact that for two or more real positive quantities there exist three well-known algebraic means, the Arithmetic, the Geometric, and the Harmonic, which stand in a fixed order of magnitude independent of the quantities operated on, suggests the question whether there may not be other algebraic means that stand in a definite order of magnitude with reference to those just named and to one another. The following paper supplies an affirmative answer to the question. The results given in the first section are, so far as I know, novel; some of those in the second section are well known, but I hope some freshness may be apparent in their treatment here.\nIn about\n1897\nMuirhead returned to Glasgow; certainly in that year he was elected to the Council of the Royal Philosophical Society of Glasgow. He had been serving on that Council up to\n1887\nwhen he had resigned because he had \"gone to London.\" Back in Glasgow, he founded the Glasgow Tutorial College at\n268\nRenfrew Street\n(\nCharing Cross\n)\n, Glasgow. At this time he was living at\n14\nKersland Street, Hillhead, Glasgow, Scotland. By\n1908\nhe had moved to nearby\n64\nGreat George Street, Hillhead, Glasgow. The entry for this College in the Post Office Glasgow Directory for\n1911\n-\n1912\nis as follows\n[\n4\n]\n:-\nGLASGOW TUTORIAL COLLEGE,\n268\nRenfrew Street\n(\nCharing Cross\n)\n,\nPRINCIPALS:\nR F Muirhead, C.E., D.Sc.\n(\nGlasgow\n)\n, B.A. Wrangler and Smith's Prizeman\n(\nCambridge\n)\n, formerly Fellow of Glasgow University and Ferguson Scholar;\nG P Rush, B.Phil.\n(\nRome\n)\n.\nDEPARTMENTS OF TUTORIAL WOBK:\nUniversity Preliminary and Matriculation Exams.; University Degree Exams.: Technical College Preliminary and Diploma Exams.; Home and India Civil Service Exams.; Inst.

PRIVATE TUITION. TUITION BY CORRESPONDENCE.\nDr Muirhead's Extra Academical Course in Mathematics is recognised by the Glasgow University Court for graduation purposes in the Faculty of Science, and is accepted as equivalent to the Intermediate Honours Class of Mathematics in the University.\nProspectus of Classes and Fees may be had on application to the Secretary.\nWe note that today, the building from where the Tutorial College operated is part of McLay's Guest House on Renfrew Street, Glasgow.\nOn\n24\nFebruary\n1909\n, Muirhead address the Royal Philosophical Society of Glasgow on\nSome Considerations on Scottish Universities, with Special Reference to Needed Reforms\n. He began his address as follows:-\nThe University of Glasgow, like the otherÂ universities of Scotland, is passing through a period of growth and change. The Universities' Commission of\n1889\n(\nthe outcome of the movement for reform that became active about half a dozen years earlier\n)\n, was occupied up till\n1897\nin issuing new Ordinances for the regulation of university affairs, and scarcely Â more than a year ago the Court exercised its power in making a new Ordinance involving further important changes. It is, I think, fairly obviousÂ that the period of change has not yet ceased, and I think no one who has the welfare of the University at heart, and who is well acquainted with its present condition would desire the cessation of reform untilÂ considerable improvements have been effected . The time is, then, opportune for the consideration of the present state and future prospects and possibilities of the University by a Society like ours which aims at being a focus for the intelligence and wisdom of the inhabitants of this city, and which Â can furnish, and from time to time has furnished an arena for serious and yet free and unprejudiced discussion of matters of practical and theoretic interest. It is with the hope of demonstrating the urgency ofÂ the problem to the members of this Society and others whom my words will reach, that I have undertaken tonight to address to you \"Some Considerations on Scottish Universities, with Special Reference to Needed Reforms.\"\nAn interesting, but slightly puzzling, invention by Muirhead seems to be associated with World War I. Olive Schreiner wrote to him in March\n1915\n[\n15\n]\n:-\nI have told no one of your invention, for one thing I couldn't! I understand so little about it - you only told me as I understood, that it was something that would require a new kind of ship to be built for it. ... I understood it was a ship - I do hope it will come off; though its rather strange that your invention should be one for taking life!!! The peaceful loving Bob!!! But I do wickedly want you to get some money.\nWe mentioned above that Muirhead was an active member of the\nEdinburgh Mathematical Society\n. In fact he served two terms as President of the Society, namely\n1899\n-\n1900\nand\n1909\n-\n1910\n.\nRobert Rankin\nwrites\n[\n12\n]\n:-\nThe first meeting\n[\nof the Society\n]\noutside Edinburgh was held in MarchÂ\n1900\nÂ in the Glasgow Philosophical Society's rooms, during the presidency of R F Muirhead, who was a Glasgow man.\nWe learn a little more about his interests from a note book he wrote\n[\n5\n]\n:-\nA surviving notebook of Muirhead's covers a variety of subjects, with material dated over several decades\n(\nc\n1876\n-\n1917)\n. An index at the front includes references to music, poetry, mathematics, philosophy, history, genealogy, recipes, as well as books lent and missing. This gives some indication of his wide-ranging interests which may be why both Schreiner and Carpenter found him so companionable.\nLet us end with\nRobert Rankin\n's assessment of Muirhead\n[\n12\n]\n:-\nI conclude this section by mentioning a man who was a fine mathematician but less successful in a worldly sense than those referred to above. Robert Franklin MuirheadÂ\n(1861\n-\n1941)\nÂ was a graduate of Glasgow and Cambridge Universities and spent some time at the University of GÃ¶ttingen. He took a great interest in the Society and was twice President, inÂ\n1899\nÂ and again inÂ\n1909\n. He was elected an Honorary Member in\n1912\n. He held lectureships in Glasgow and Birmingham for brief periods and tutorships in London, Edinburgh and Glasgow, but never held any permanent position worthy of his talents. It is possible that this may have been because of his outspoken views on home rule and socialism. In his latter years he was head of a coaching establishment, the Glasgow Tutorial College. I first heard of Muirhead forty years ago from my supervisor, the late Professor\nG H Hardy\n, who had a high opinion of Muirhead's abilities, and some of his work on convexity which is of interest to statisticians has recently come into greater prominence. Men like Muirhead, or his younger colleague\nJohn Dougall\n(1867\n-\n1960)\n, who was President in\n1925\n, would easily have obtained university posts in the goldenÂ\n25\nÂ years following the last war, but they lived in times, rather like those we have moved into recently, when appropriate positions were not available to everyone of ability.\nAlthough we are certain that\nRankin\nis correct in suggestiong that Muirhead may have suffered discrimination because of his \"outspoken views on home rule and socialism\", may we suggest that an additional third reason for discrimination against him could be his behaviour illustrated by Tanya Cheadle in her\n2014\nUniversity of Glasgow Ph.D. thesis\nRealizing a 'more than earthly paradise of love': Scotland's sexual progressives,\n1880\n-\n1914\n:-\nThe first example centres around Bob Muirhead, a Glasgow mathematician and member of the Scottish Socialist League, who formed a long-term friendship with both Carpenter and Olive Schreiner. Between\n1889\nand\n1890\n, the 'wonderfully handsome and athletic' Muirhead stayed with Carpenter at Millthorpe, enjoying what Carpenter termed a 'romance of affection' with James Brown, a tailor, poet and fellow member of the Scottish Socialist League, as well as sleeping with Carpenter, before three years later marrying and settling down in Glasgow.\nMuirhead's wife died on\n17\nJune\n1940\nand he died about six months later in January\n1941\n. Their last residence had been\n8\nPark Avenue, Glasgow.\nAn obituary, written by\nJohn Dougall\n, was published in the Proceedings of the\nEdinburgh Mathematical Society\n. See\nTHIS LINK\n."
