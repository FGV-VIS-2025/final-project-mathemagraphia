  "biografia": "Wolfgang GaschÃ¼tz\nwas born in the village Karlshof which is located in the Oderbruch region about\n60\nkm east of Berlin. He related an early mathematical experience in\n[\n3\n]\n:-\nIn\n1931\n, we made an effort to find common divisors in order to cancel fractions, in the second year of secondary school in Wriezen - I wistfully remember this little old town in the East ... The excessive thoroughness of this procedure bored me, and coaxed me into declaring that one merely had to try up to the difference of the numerator from the denominator. The mathematics teacher, Mr Kempin, who had tolerated our efforts without this constraint, turned to the blackboard, perhaps a little embarrassed. There he probably wrote down this line, which confirmed my remark, but which I did not yet understand:\na\n=\nu\nd\n,\nb\n=\nv\nd\nâ\na\nâ\nb\n=\n(\nu\nâ\nv\n)\nd\na = ud, b = vd \\Rightarrow a - b = (u - v)d\na\n=\nu\nd\n,\nb\n=\nv\nd\nâ\na\nâ\nb\n=\n(\nu\nâ\nv\n)\nd\nThe memory of my discovery of this beneficial little theorem from number theory then remained such a distinct one probably because it was a first mathematical experience for me, and because the praise I received for it afterwards encouraged me to perform well in mathematics from then on. Out of everything that I have accomplished so far this is proof to myself that I am a mathematician more than anything else.\nIn\n1931\nthe family moved to Berlin where GaschÃ¼tz's father became the owner of an industrial estate. He studied at the\ngymnasium\nthere and, after the\nabitur\nin\n1938\n, chose to become an artillery officer. His military career ended in April\n1945\n, fortunately near Kiel where his own family lived at that time. In\n1943\nhe had married Gudrun Strasser, the daughter of an Oderbruch farmer; they have a son and two daughters. Further details of his life are described in his speech\n[\n3\n]\nwhich can be read in an English translation at:\nTHIS LINK\n.\nIn the autumn of\n1945\nGaschÃ¼tz entered the University of Kiel\n(\nChristian-Albrechts-UniversitÃ¤t zu Kiel\n)\n. He described in\n[\n3\n]\nhow he first met group theory:-\nIn\n1946\n, all of us students lived in the berths of the Orla, a ship ready to be handed over to the English. We lived on barter in all areas of life. Among my meek belongings was a rather special mathematics book. It had been published in\n1942\n, and after the disastrous winter in the East the wartime economy must have deemed it beneficial to winning the war and therefore worthy of publication, despite the shortage in demand, due to its title: 'The Geometry of Fabrics'. In any case, to me it seemed dispensable as a basis for studying mathematics. - One of my roommates offered me a book for it, whose title admittedly meant less to me, but which would hardly hold less interest for me than mine. The exchange was made. The book that I had acquired then became a revelation to me: Andreas Speiser's 'Group Theory'. ... The effects that this simple exchange of books had on the development of the mathematical seminar in Kiel can arguably still be perceived today. This is an example that shows how minor variations of the initial conditions can influence the solutions of an equation considerably.\nHe was awarded a doctorate in\n1949\nfor his thesis\nZur Ï-Untergruppe endlicher Gruppen\nâ\n(\nOn the phi-subgroup of finite groups\n)\n.\nHabilitation\n, the right to lecture, followed in\n1953\n, a further promotion\n(\nDiÃ¤tendozent\n)\nin\n1956\n, and, finally, in\n1963\nhe received a full professorship from which he retired in\n1988\n. Calls to Karlsruhe and Mainz had been rejected. He explained why he wanted to remain in Kiel in\n[\n3\n]\n:-\nI could reject the chair at Karlsruhe on the grounds that, following ancient family tradition, Karl was one of my given names and that Karlshof - often written with 'ff' by its owners - was my place of birth. Being in my early forties, to me Karlsruhe clearly had to forebode all too early scientific twilight years. - In short, I stayed in Kiel, with the same offer and keeping the abundant range of research projects. The decision was much more difficult when I was appointed to Mainz, where my colleague Bertram Huppert was one of the main figures. I had been communicating with him on scientific matters for a long time, through the medium of\nHelmut Wielandt\n, our great mentor in group theory; and we were united by a fate: Huppert's book - no, not book, but thesaurus on finite groups. - The genesis of this plan of creating the book had committed me to participate in the editing process and to contribute my humble advice. ... Thus Huppert visited us in Kiel for four weeks per year, allegedly to use the assistance of me and other colleagues from Kiel. In reality this endeavour proved to be a marvellous and gratefully used opportunity for our seminar to thoroughly keep up with the latest developments. ... I had become so accustomed to this close and convenient collaboration with Huppert, that, with my propensity to be sedentary, I stayed in the seminar in Kiel, which I had grown fond of.\nIn the years after the war, in fact, since the death of\nErnst Steinitz\nin\n1928\n, there was no algebraist lecturing at Kiel University. GaschÃ¼tz's interest in group theory, as explained in the quote above, was initiated by Andras Speiser's book\nDie Theorie der Gruppen endlicher Ordnung\nand stimulated by\nHelmut Wielandt\n's work. So algebraic life started again in Kiel, and GaschÃ¼tz succeeded - also by attracting other algebraists interested in group theory - to transform Kiel into a noted centre of this field.\nIn his first publication\nZur Erweiterungstheorie der endlichen Gruppen\nâ\n(\nOn the expansion theory of finite groups\n)\n(1952)\nhe obtained a generalization of a well-known theorem of\nIssai Schur\n. The significance of this result and perspectives of its development were discussed by\nWielandt\nin his talk at the International Congress of Mathematicians in\n1958\n.\nWielandt\nwrites in\n[\n4\n]\n:-\nLet us formulate a problem on complements. Let\nN\nN\nN\nbe a normal subgroup of a group\nG\nG\nG\n. When does\nG\nG\nG\ncontain at least one complement\nC\nC\nC\nto\nN\nN\nN\n, and when are two given complements\nC\n,\nC\n1\nC, C_{1}\nC\n,\nC\n1\nâ\nto\nN\nN\nN\nconjugate in\nG\nG\nG\n?  The important contribution to studying this problem is due to GaschÃ¼tz.\nVery early GaschÃ¼tz realized the importance of the\nFrattini\nsubgroup for the structure theory of finite groups. In his paper\nÃber die Ï-Untergruppe endlicher Gruppen\n(1953)\nhe obtained basic properties of the\nFrattini\nand\nFitting\nsubgroups of finite groups. In\n1954\nhe proved a universal\nFrattini\np\np\np\n-elementary extension existence theorem: if a prime number\np\np\np\ndivides the order of a finite group\nG\nG\nG\n, then there exists a finite group\nH\nH\nH\nwith a normal\np\np\np\n-subgroup\nK\nK\nK\nâ\n1\nsuch that\nK\nâ¤\nÏ\n(\nH\n)\nK â¤ \\phi(H)\nK\nâ¤\nÏ\n(\nH\n)\nand\nH\n/\nK\nH/K\nH\n/\nK\nis isomorphic to\nG\nG\nG\n. And in\n1978\nhe proved the following beautiful result: if\nM\n/\nN\nM/N\nM\n/\nN\nis a chief factor of maximal order in a finite soluble group\nG\nG\nG\n, then\nM\nM\nM\nis contained in the\nFitting\nsubgroup of\nG\nG\nG\n.\nIn\n1955\nNoboru Ito considered the subgroup\nÏ\n(\nG\n)\n\\psi (G)\nÏ\n(\nG\n)\ngenerated by all minimal subgroups of a finite group\nG\nG\nG\n. It is obviously the dual to the\nFrattini\nsubgroup\nÏ\n(\nG\n)\n\\phi (G)\nÏ\n(\nG\n)\nand so it was expected that\nG\n/\nÏ\n(\nG\n)\nG/\\psi (G)\nG\n/\nÏ\n(\nG\n)\nmight have similar properties as\nÏ\n(\nG\n)\n\\phi (G)\nÏ\n(\nG\n)\n. But in his paper\nÃber das Frattinidual\n(1965)\nGaschÃ¼tz proved that for every finite group G there exists a finite group\nH\nH\nH\nsuch that\nG\nG\nG\nis isomorphic to\nH\n/\nÏ\n(\nH\n)\nH/\\psi (H)\nH\n/\nÏ\n(\nH\n)\nand\nÏ\n(\nH\n)\n\\psi (H)\nÏ\n(\nH\n)\nis abelian with elementary\nSylow\nsubgroups.\nIn his paper\nPraefrattinigruppen\nâ\n(\nAbout Frattini groups\n)\n(1962)\nGaschÃ¼tz introduced subgroups in finite soluble groups which somehow take hold of the complications arising from Frattini properties. Doerk and Hawkes write in\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nA database search in\n1990\nbrought to light some\n38\narticles having \"prefrattini subgroup\" either in their title or cited as a key phrase, which is convincing evidence that GaschÃ¼tz's original idea has been widely investigated and variously generalized.\nGaschÃ¼tz never followed modern trends much but rather his own scientific interests. As an example we mention GaschÃ¼tz's formation theory which has its origin in famous papers of\nPhilip Hall\nand Roger Carter and has been spreading all over the world since\n1963\nwhen his brilliant article\nZur Theorie der endlichen auflÃ¶sbaren Gruppen\nâ\n(\nOn the theory of finite resolvable groups\n)\nwas published. A group class\nF\nF\nF\nwas called by GaschÃ¼tz:\n1)\na\nformation\nif\nF\nF\nF\nis closed under taking epimorphic images, and\nG\n/\nA\nG/A\nG\n/\nA\nbelongs to\nF\nF\nF\n,\nG\n/\nB\nG/B\nG\n/\nB\nbelongs to\nF\nF\nF\nalways implies\nG\n/\n(\nA\nâ\nB\n)\nG/(A \\bigcap  B)\nG\n/\n(\nA\nâ\nB\n)\nbelongs to\nF\nF\nF\n;\n2)\na\nsaturated formation\nif\nF\nF\nF\nis a formation and\nG\n/\nÏ\n(\nG\nG/\\phi(G\nG\n/\nÏ\n(\nG\n)\nbelongs to\nF\nF\nF\nalways implies\nG\nG\nG\nbelongs to\nF\nF\nF\n.\nPrevious results of\nO Yu Schmidt\n(1926)\nand B Huppert\n(1954)\nshow that the classes of finite nilpotent and of finite supersoluble groups are saturated formations. GaschÃ¼tz produced a general method to construct saturated formations. But his main aim was to construct in every finite soluble group a class of conjugate subgroups belonging to\nF\nF\nF\n, the so called\nF\nF\nF\n-covering subgroups or\nF\nF\nF\n-projectors. B Fischer realized that it is possible to dualize this theory and obtained\nFitting\nclasses and their injectors. In his\nCanberra Lecture Notes Lectures on subgroups of Sylow type in finite soluble groups\n(1979)\nGaschÃ¼tz gives a unified treatment of these theories. In\n[\n5\n]\nGaschÃ¼tz's words told by him in\n1994\nat the seminar in Kiel are cited:-\nAfter completion of the classification of simple groups the main problem in the theory of finite groups remains the problem of mastering mechanisms of their interaction in arbitrary groups. The most important handicap here is p-groups.\nThe theory of formations, as well as the theory of\nFitting\nclasses, is an attempt to be engaged in the theory of groups, that is to say, modulo p-groups. For all that, separate groups are considered through these classes as if in a diminishing glass, and structural operations on groups can be treated, in a definite respect, as construction of normalizers, extensions, joins, etc.\nFurther results of GaschÃ¼tz attracted much attention. We mention the following most prominent examples.\nIn two early papers he characterized those modules which are direct summands when they occur in a representation and he proved that a finite group has a faithful irreducible representation if and only if its socle is generated by a single class of conjugate elements.\nHe characterized the finite soluble groups in which normality is a transitive relation.\nHe gave a formula for the Eulerian function introduced by\nPhilip Hall\nand determined the number of generators of a finite soluble group in terms of the structure and embedding of its chief factors.\nAs an application of cohomological methods, he proved that the outer automorphism group of a finite\np\np\np\n-group of order larger than\np\np\np\nhas order divisible by\np\np\np\n.\nWolfgang GaschÃ¼tz was invited as a visiting professor to Michigan State University\n(1963)\n, Queen Mary College of the University of London\n(1965\n,\n1970)\n, Universities of Padua, Florence, Naples\n(1966\n,\n1971\n,\n1974)\n, University of Warwick\n(1967\n,\n1973\n,\n1977)\n, University of Illinois at Chicago\n(1968)\n, and the University of Canberra\n(1969)\n. In\n2000\nhe received an honorary doctorate from Francisk Scorina Gomel State University, Republic of Belarus.\nHe died in November\n2016\nand by his own request he was buried in his birthplace, Karlshof."
