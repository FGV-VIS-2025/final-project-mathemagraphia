  "biografia": "We note first that\nPaul Alexander Dienes\nwas also known as\nPÃ¡l SÃ¡ndor Dienes\n. He seldom used his middle name, however, and is usually known as\nPaul Diene\ns. He came from a wealthy family who were Presbyterians. He was the son of BarnabÃ¡s Dienes\n(1852\n-\n1923)\n, a jurist who owned local vineyards, and Ilona Pusztay\n(1860\n-\n1934)\n, who was of Greek origin. Barna and Ilona Dienes were married in Debrecen on\n7\nOctober\n1877\n. They had eight children: KlÃ¡ra Katalin Dienes\n(1878\n-\n1959)\n; RÃ³sza Ilona Etelka Dienes\n(1880\n-\n1971)\n; KÃ¡lmÃ¡n Dienes\n(1882\n-\n1954)\n; PÃ¡l SÃ¡ndor Dienes\n(1882\n-\n1952)\n, the subject of this biography; Lajos Dienes\n(1885\n-\n1974\n: LÃ¡szlÃ³ Dienes\n(1889\n-\n1953)\n, Barna Dienes\n(1895\n-\n1950)\n; and Katalin Dienes\n(1900\n-\n1979)\n. We note at this point that KÃ¡lmÃ¡n became an engineer, Lajos became a bacteriologist, and Barna became a Presbyterian priest.\nPaul Dienes was educated at the Debrecen Reformed College. This important college had been founded in\n1538\nand provided a good education, particularly strong in philosophy. After graduating from the Debrecen Reformed College, Dienes began studying mathematics and physics at the PÃ¡zmÃ¡ny PÃ©ter University in Budapest\n(\nit was later renamed the\nEÃ¶tvÃ¶s LorÃ¡nd\nUniversity\n)\n. There he was taught by\nLipÃ³t FejÃ©r\nwho also taught the student ValÃ©ria Anna Geiger\n(1879\n-\n1978)\n. ValÃ©ria Geiger's\n[\n5\n]\n:-\n... university work focused on studying mathematics and physics.\nLipÃ³t FejÃ©r\n, the doyen of Hungarian mathematics of that period, was in love with ValÃ©ria. He happened to introduce Paul Dienes to her, with the remark that Paul Dienes was a mathematical genius, an introduction that led to their marriage. ValÃ©ria began her doctoral studies of philosophy by listening to BernÃ¡t Alexander's lectures, the leading philosopher of Budapest those days, just like\nPÃ³lya\nand many contemporary intellectuals did. She received her degree in the same ceremony as Paul Dienes in\n1905\nat PÃ¡zmÃ¡ny PÃ©ter University, Budapest. They exchanged engagement rings during that ceremony. Paul received his doctorate in mathematics. ValÃ©ria's doctorate was in philosophy as a major subject with a first minor in mathematics and a second minor in aesthetics.\nWhile undertaking research, Dienes had spent some time in Paris studying with\nÃmile Borel\nand\nJacques Hadamard\nat UniversitÃ© Paris IV-Sorbonne. The degree ceremony in Budapest was held on\n24\nJune\n1905\nand Dienes was awarded a doctorate for his thesis\nAdditions to the theory of analytic functions\n(\nHungarian\n)\n. Paul and ValÃ©ria Dienes were married in December\n1905\n. On\n2\nAugust\n1907\nhe began teaching at the\n10\nth District State High School High School where he taught mathematics, physics, philosophy, and French. He went to Paris with his wife in\n1908\nand, after working with\nBorel\nand\nHadamard\n, published the\n88\n-pageÂ\nEssai sur les SingularitÃ©s des Fonctions Analytiques\nâ\n(\nEssay on the singularities of analytic functions\n)\nwith Gauthier-Villars in Paris in\n1909\n. ValÃ©ria worked with the philosopher Henri-Louis Bergson\n(1859\n-\n1941)\nand became fascinated by the relations between dance and mathematics\n[\n4\n]\n:-\nThe couple had a common interest in epistemology and in the philosophy of mathematics and physics at a time when the university life of Paris was loud from the discussion of functional representations of physical quantities, duration, and measurable time.\nEinstein\n's definitions on simultaneity and thoughts on the relativity of length and time\n(1905)\nbegan to become more widely known these days in France, while Bergson's public lectures in the CollÃ¨ge de France went on about 'duration' and 'time'. The couple worked together on common analytical functional topics. Paul had a strong interest in the mathematical problems of the theory of relativity and vector space singularities. Reports on their work in this period were published in the 'Comptes Rendus' of the\nAcadÃ©mie des Sciences\n, and in several papers in Hungarian.\nTheir joint papers include\nSur les singularitÃ©s algÃ©brologarithmiques\nâ\n(\nOn algebrologarithmic singularities\n)\n(1909)\nand three papers on\nGeneral theorems on algebraic and logarithmic singularity\n(\nHungarian\n)\nin\n1911\nand\n1912\n.\nAs a school teacher in Hungary he gave lectures aimed at parents of the school children, organised charity events to raise money to support the education of children of poor parents, and arranged field trips for his students in the areas of thermodynamics and electrical engineering. ValÃ©ria Dienes was friendly with the poet and writer MihÃ¡ly Babits\n(1883\n-\n1941)\nand a close friendship developed between Paul Dienes and Babits. Dienes took part in school groups led by Babits discussing method of education. It was not only school teaching that Dienes undertook at this time for he was appointed as a docent at the University of Budapest in\n1908\n, a docent at the University of Cluj-Napoca in\n1912\n, and at the University of Budapest in\n1916\n.\nÃmile Borel\nhad approached Dienes to see if he would publish his Budapest lectures as a monograph in the series \"Collection of Monographs on the Theory of Functions, published under the direction of M\nÃmile Borel\n,\" and Dienes'\nLeÃ§ons sur les singularitÃ©s des fonctions analytiques\nâ\n(\nLessons on singularities of snalytic functions\n)\nwas published in that collection in\n1913\n.\nYou can read extracts from reviews of\nLeÃ§ons sur les singularitÃ©s des fonctions analytiques\nâ\n(\nLessons on singularities of snalytic functions\n)\nat\nTHIS LINK\n.\nPaul and ValÃ©ria Dienes had two children, Gedeon Dienes\n(\nborn in Budapest on\n16\nDecember\n1914)\nand\nZoltan PÃ¡l Dienes\n(\nborn in Budapest on\n11\nSeptember\n1916)\n. Gedeon Dienes learnt English, French, German, Swedish, Italian and Russian and became a secretary at the Foreign Office. He represented Hungary at the peace conference at the end of World War II. He later worked in the Publishing House of the\nHungarian Academy of Sciences\n, then became interested in dance, writing articles in many languages and founding a Budapest dance company.\nZoltan Dienes\nbecame a mathematician and has a biography in this archive.\nBÃ©la Kun was a Hungarian CommunistÂ revolutionary and politicianÂ who, with Soviet support, led a successful\ncoup d'Ã©tat\nand proclaimed the Hungarian Soviet Republic. As People's Commissar of Foreign Affairs he was the effective leader of Hungary from March\n1919\nuntil August\n1919\n. Dienes had been a strong supporter of BÃ©la Kun and, together with Babists, had argued for him in lectures to students and in protests in cafes. After the Hungarian Soviet Republic was formed, he became the head of the committee appointed to run the University of Budapest and also took part in the organisation of the Marx-Engels Workers' University. In mid July\n1919\n, the Romanian army attacked Hungary, and when the Red Army failed to come to their aid, BÃ©la Ku fled the country. Counter-revolutionaries start to hunt down supporters of BÃ©la Kun and execute them. Richard George Cooke\n(1895\n-\n1965)\nwrites\n[\n9\n]\n:-\nDuring the Government of Bela Kun, Dienes took an active part in educational work in relation to the University. When this Government fell in\n1919\n, Dienes had to leave Hungary in haste, with his life in danger. He has given me entertaining and thrilling accounts of his escape, and of his activities in the first period after his exile; for example, he escaped from Hungary in a cargo boat on the Danube which was supposed to be carrying beer to Vienna, and he occupied one cask instead of the beer. He duly arrived in Vienna ...\nLet us give a few more details about his escape. To avoid being captured, Dienes had hidden in a cupboard in a friends' apartment. His food was brought regularly by Sari Chylinska\n(1898\n-\n1992)\nwho had studied dance with ValÃ©ria Dienes in Budapest from\n1915\nto\n1918\n. She and Dienes became romantically involved. ValÃ©ria tried to arrange for Dienes to be taken out of the country and was put in touch with the captain of a river boat. He agreed to smuggle Dienes out of the country but only if he received a large sum of money. To raise this sum, all the family possessions had to be sold, including their large and very valuable library. He arrived in Vienna with nothing but the clothes he was wearing.\nAfter Dienes arrived in Vienna in\n1920\nhe failed to find an academic position and only managed to do a little film work being in crowd scenes in a film. ValÃ©ria, Gedeon,\nZoltan\nand Sari Chylinska joined Dienes in Vienna and they lived in a Montessori children's home. Paul and ValÃ©ria agreed to divorce, ValÃ©ria and the children went to Nice in France, where they lived in a commune run by Raymond Duncan, the brother of the dancer Isadora Duncan. Paul, after contacting\nÃmile Borel\nand\nJacques Hadamard\n, made his way to Paris with Sari in\n1921\n. He asked\nHadamard\nif he knew of any British or American university that would like to employ him to teach as \"a representative of the Paris School of Mathematicians.\" By coincidence\nHadamard\nwas approached by\nW H Young\na couple of weeks later asking if he knew anyone looking for a position who could teach in the Parisian style. Dienes moved to Wales and began teaching in Aberystwyth in October\n1921\n.\nIn\n1922\nDienes' divorce from ValÃ©ria became official and he married Sari in Neukematen, Austria on\n26\nJuly of that year. He had been looking at the fundamental ideas in the theory of relativity and published papers such as\nSur la connection du champ tensoriel\nâ\n(\nOn the connection of the tensor field\n)\n(1922)\n. He had made some criticisms and\nEinstein\nwrote to him in August\n1922\n:-\nYour attack on the mathematical theories by\nWeyl\nand\nEddington\nonly touches the formulation, not however the content.\nWeyl\nhad treated the second-order quantities loosely negligently but in a manner that is easily demonstrated to be innocuous. I am sending you a small book in which you will find on pages\n48\n-\n49\na proof\nLevi-Civita\n's and\nWeyl\n's train of thought sketched a little more precisely, against which there ought to be no objection, in which he avoids these inaccuracies so such objections do not arise anymore.\nIn\n1923\nW H Young\nresigned from Aberystwyth and Dienes left to take up a lectureship in Swansea, Wales. Paul and Sari Dienes set up home in Sketty, on the outskirts of Swansea.\nEvan Davies\nhad begun his university studies in\n1921\nat Aberystwyth and was taught there by both Dienes and\nW H Young\n. When both left in\n1923\n,\nEvan Davies\nfollowed Dienes to Swansea where his research advisor was Dienes who advised him to work on the absolute differential calculus. In\n1926\nG H Hardy\nand\nArchibald Richardson\napproached Dienes suggesting he write a book on\nTaylor\nseries. After four years work, in\n1931\nThe Taylor Series. An Introduction to the Theory of Functions of a Complex Variable\nwas published. Norman Miller writes\n[\n16\n]\n:-\nProfessor Dienes has here performed a notable service to the mathematical world in assembling and ordering in a thoroughgoing manner the modern theories relating to\nTaylor\nseries. From its title and subtitle one might suppose the book to be another elementary text book on complex function theory from the\nWeierstrass\npoint of view. The title however is too modest. The book is a pioneer in its field and makes no inconsiderable demands on the maturity of its readers.\nJoseph Ritt\nwrites\n[\n19\n]\n:-\nThis treatise conducts the reader from the elements of real variable theory into some of the furthest reaches of complex analysis. ... It would be difficult to overestimate the value, for advanced students, of these later chapters in Dienes' book. They reduce to didactic form a large section of the recent literature on complex analysis. ... this treatise ... is the work of a distinguished authority and will hold an important place in every mathematical library.\nYou can read more extensive extracts from reviews of this book at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nIn\n1929\n, before Dienes had finished writing his book on\nTaylor\nseries, he had left Swansea to take up a readership at Birkbeck College in the University of London. Dienes' two sons, Gedeon and\nZoltan\n, spent most of the year with their mother ValÃ©ria, but would spend the summers with Paul and Sari Dienes travelling in France, Germany, Hungary, Italy and Transylvania. Dienes kept his interest in music and dance and in\n1930\nhe and his wife became friends with the composer Michael Tippett and with the classical Indian dancer Uday Shankar, brother of Ravi Shankar. In\n1937\nPaul and Sari Dienes separated.\nIn addition to\nEvan Davies\n, Dienes supervised the Ph.D. studies of a number of outstanding students including: H S Allen, who wrote the thesis\nMaximum matrix rings\n(1942)\n; Ralph Henstock\n(1923\n-\n2007)\n, who wrote the thesis\nInterval Functions and their Integrals\n(1948)\n;\nAbraham Robinson\n, who wrote the thesis\nThe Metamathematics of Algebraic Systems\n(1949)\n; and Paul Vermes\n(1897\n-\n1968)\n, who wrote the thesis\nGamma matrices and their applications to infinite series\n(1947)\n. Although not formally\nReuben Louis Goodstein\n's advisor, nevertheless he was much involved in helping\nGoodstein\nwith his thesis\nAn axiom-free equation calculus\n(1946)\n. He also wrote the joint paper\nOn the effective range of generalised limit processes\n(1938)\nwith Richard George Cooke and encouraged him to write the book\nInfinite matrices and sequence spaces\n(1950)\nwhich contains a wealth of original results by Cooke and by Dienes.\nDienes was appointed to the newly created Chair of Mathematics at Birkbeck College in\n1945\n. He became more interested in logic and wrote papers such as\nOn ternary logic\n(1945)\nwhich begins as follows:-\nIn this paper we give the complete list of the functions of one variable with some of their properties, and lists of functions corresponding to various properties of sum, product, implication, and equivalence. The range of the variables as well as that of functional values will be\n0\n(\nfalse\n)\n,\n1\n2\n\\large\\frac{1}{2}\\normalsize\n2\n1\nâ\n,\n1\n(\ntrue\n)\n. As an application we consider\nFrege\n's,\nRussell\n's and\nHeyting\n's systems in ternary logic. The proofs are mostly omitted as obvious if sometimes laborious.\nWilhelm Ackermann\n, reviewing this paper, writes\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nIt is well known that in a three-valued propositional calculus with the values\n0\n,\n1\n2\n\\large\\frac{1}{2}\\normalsize\n2\n1\nâ\n,\n1\nthere is no unequivocal determination of the matrix system defining the logical connections due to the lack of a generally recognised interpretation. Usually, however, one will proceed in such a way that the logical functions for\n0\nand\n1\nretain the same values that they have in two-valued logic. Symmetry will be required for disjunction, conjunction and equivalence. The author now undertakes to list the various possibilities that then remain for negation, disjunction, conjunction, implication and equivalence and to group them according to their main properties. It is stated which types of conjunctions and disjunctions are associative, which disjunctions with regard to which conjunctions satisfy one or the other of the two distributive laws, and for which definition of negation, conjunction and disjunction\nDe Morgan\n's formulas apply.\nDienes retired in\n1948\nand turned to writing poetry. The book of his poems,\nThe Maiden And The Unicorn: A Cycle Of Poems\n, was published in\n1954\n, two years after his death. His friend, the composer Michael Tippet, said of his poetry\n[\n9\n]\n:-\nThe first thing to remember about him was that he had a philosophical and mathematical discipline as the core of his mind, but music had an almost Schopenhauerian significance for him .... I think, therefore, that his poetry represented an attempt at an amalgam of these various sensibilities, so that the sound pattern of the verse seems to overbalance the pattern of the sense. It is possible that I, as someone with a musical discipline, and abiding interest, though no aptitude, for philosophy, can savour Dienes's poetry better than most.\nDienes died of a heart attack in March\n1952\n. Cooke writes\n[\n9\n]\n:-\nDienes had a most charming personality, and was much loved by both his colleagues and his students."
