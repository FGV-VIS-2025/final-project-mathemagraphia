  "biografia": "James Ezeilo\nwas the son of Josiah Ezeilo and his wife Janet. Josiah Ezeilo was a catechist at various Anglican missions in Eastern Nigeria while Janet was trader. Josiah and Janet had four sons, with James being the second. His older brother was Japhet Ezeilo, while his two younger brothers were Walter Nwanko Ezeilo and Gabriel Chukwujekwu Ezeilo. Walter, born\n1\nJune\n1932\n, became a sales executive and worked in the oil industry. The youngest of the four brothers, Gabriel, was born\n3\nNovember\n1934\nand died\n22\nNovember\n2011\n. He was described by James as\n[\n8\n]\n:-\n... a strong man of Medicine, distinguished in Physiology,\n[\nwho\n]\nhad written many scientific papers and had published two world renown Physiology books through Oxford University Press, for University level medical students. He loved his subject and thoroughly enjoyed talking about it. He was also a highly successful University teacher.\nJames wrote about growing up with Gabriel\n[\n8\n]\n:-\nGab as we all call him was my youngest brother and the favourite of all the brothers. We had an especially soft spot for each other and I particularly remember a day in the late\n1930\ns coming back from the market with Mama who had all sorts of goodies for all the children, and as we got to the compound, a very young Gab spotted us and rushed out of the house towards us happily dancing and singing \"James is back, James is back\" as opposed to the more usual \"Mama is back\" and rushed and hugged me very warmly ... it was a special moment that captured and typified the strong bond and affection we had all our lives.\nThe family moved to various places in Eastern Nigeria as James grew up and for a while they lived in Umunjam, Imo State. After attending several different schools as the family moved around, he entered the Dennis Memorial Grammar School, Onitsha, in\n1944\n. This school was run by the Church Mission Society, founded in\n1799\nin the City of London, England, by men including William Wilberforce who, like all the founders, was passionately committed to the abolition of the slave trade. Another founder of the Church Mission Society was John Venn, the grandfather of the mathematician\nJohn Venn\n. The Dennis Memorial Grammar School was founded in\n1925\n, nearly\n70\nyears after the Society began its mission in the area. This long delay was due to the Society believing for a long time that its role was the propagation of Christianity for which secondary education was not necessary. During the period that Ezeilo attended the Memorial Grammar School its principal was E D C Clark who raised the standards of the school in arts, science and technical subjects.\nEzeilo graduated from the Dennis Memorial Grammar School in\n1948\nand, having achieved the highest marks in the University Entrance Examination, he entered the new University College Ibadan\n(\nnow the University of Ibadan\n)\nin\n1949\nto study mathematics. The University of Ibadan was established in\n1948\nas a College of the University of London, England; it was the first university to be established in Nigeria. It became an independent university in\n1962\nafter the country gained its independence from Britain. Ezeilo had a highly successful undergraduate career winning many departmental prizes, faculty prizes, and the University of Ibadan Major Scholar Award. In\n1953\nhe graduated with a B.Sc.\n(\nFirst Class Honours in Mathematics\n)\nand in the following year he was awarded a B.Sc. Advanced Degree\n(\nwith distinction\n)\n. He then began postgraduate studies and received an M.Sc. in\n1955\n.\nThe award of a Leverhulme scholarship enabled him to travel to England and matriculate at Queens' College, University of Cambridge, in\n1955\n. He sailed from Lagos on the ship Aureol and arrived at Liverpool on\n26\nSeptember\n1955\n. From Liverpool he travelled to Cambridge. There was a number of world class mathematicians teaching at Cambridge during the years that Ezeilo studied there, including\nJ W S Cassels\n,\nMichael Atiyah\n,\nFrank Smithies\n,\nAbram Besicovitch\nand\nMary Cartwright\n. It was\nCartwright\nwho became Ezeilo's thesis supervisor and advised him during his research on ordinary differential equations. He was awarded a doctorate in\n1959\nfor his thesis\nSome Topics in the Theory of Ordinary Non-linear differential Equations of the Third Order\nalthough he had submitted his thesis and had been examined in\n1958\n. On\n28\nAugust\n1958\nhe sailed from Liverpool on the\nTamele\n, arriving in Lagos, Nigeria.\nHe began publishing papers based on the research he had undertaken for his Ph.D. The first few papers are\nOn the boundedness of solutions of a certain differential equation of the third order\n(1959)\n,\nOn the stability of solutions of certain differential equations of the third order\n(1960)\n,\nOn the existence of periodic solutions of a certain third-order differential equation\n(1960)\n, and\nA note on a boundedness theorem for some third order differential equations\n(1961)\n. The results of the\n1959\npaper are of the same type as the ones obtained for second order equations by\nMary Cartwright\nin her\n1950\npaper\nContributions to the theory of nonlinear oscillations\n. In this\n1959\npaper, Ezeilo writes, \"I  should like to express my gratitude to Dr\nM L Cartwright\nfor her help and guidance in the preparation of this paper. His address on the paper is Queen's College, Cambridge. On the first of the\n1960\npapers, Ezeilo gives his address as Ibadan and he gives the acknowledgement, \"I am grateful to Dr\nM L Cartwright\nfor suggestions leading to the widening of the scope of this paper.\" The\n1961\npaper, with address University College, Ibadan, Nigeria, contains improvements of the results of the\n1959\npaper.\nAfter Ezeilo returned to Nigeria, he was appointed as Lecturer II in Mathematics at University College Ibadan in\n1959\n. He returned to England in the summer of\n1960\n, sailing from Lagos on the\nAccra\nto Liverpool, arriving on\n11\nJuly. He returned home a month later on the\nApapa\n, sailing from Liverpool on\n18\nAugust on a voyage to Lagos. In\n1962\n, the year the University of Ibadan became an independent university, he was promoted to Senior Lecturer in Mathematics and, in the following year, he went to the United States for a sabbatical year. He spent the academic year\n1963\n-\n64\nas a Visiting Lecturer and Research Associate at the Department of Mathematics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. On his return to the University of Ibadan he was promoted to professor in\n1964\n.\nNigeria had become an independent country in\n1960\n, ending its time as a British colony but the Biafran War broke out in July\n1967\n. A military coup in\n1966\nwas a significant factor in the outbreak of war which was fought between government forces and the state of Biafra which was seeking independence motivated by ethnic and religious differences. These events seemed to be the reason that Ezeilo left the University of Ibadan in\n1966\nto take up the position of Professor of Mathematics at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka. This university had been founded in\n1955\nalthough it only opened formally on\n7\nOctober\n1960\n. Ezeilo became head of the Department of Mathematics in\n1967\nbut, in July\n1967\n, Nsukka became one of the first Biafran town to be captured by Nigerian forces. As a result of this, the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, was burned down and chaos resulted. The students at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, had joined the Biafran army when was had been declared although they had no weapons. Few survived the attack by the Nigerian army.\nThe university had renamed itself the University of Biafra in July\n1967\nand it continued to have this name until January\n1970\nwhen the civil war came to an end. Ezeilo took up his position as head of the Department of Mathematics in\n1970\nbut in November of that year he was appointed as Acting Vice-Chancellor. He held this position for four months until the appointment of Herbert C Kodilinye, a Professor of Medicine, as Vice-Chancellor. At this point Ezeilo returned to his position of head of the Department of Mathematics. The appointment of Herbert Kodilinye was not a great success, partly because the inhabitants of Nsukka became depressed after the Biafran war. He tried to remodel the university to give it the British Oxbridge collegiate structure. This, however, was not popular and there were rivalries between the academics which made it a difficult place in which to work. In\n1975\nEzeilo was appointed as the Vice Chancellor, taking over from Herbert Kodilinye, and so became the fifth Vice Chancellor. He held this position until\n1978\nwhen he moved to Bayero University, Kano, as Vice Chancellor. This university only became independent in\n1977\nunder the Vice Chancellor Mahmud Tukur, and Ezeilo became the second Vice Chancellor in\n1978\n. This move had not been Ezeilo's choice, but rather\n[\n2\n]\n:-\n... the then military government posted him to the University from University of Nigeria, Nsukka, as part of its policy of posting Vice Chancellors to different universities.\nHe only held this position in Kano for one year, however, for in\n1979\nhe went to the United States for sabbatical leave being appointed Benedict Distinguished Professor of Mathematics at Carleton College, Northfield, Minnesota and then Visiting Professor of Mathematics at Howard University, Washington DC. The obituary\n[\n2\n]\ngives information about what Ezeilo achieved during his year as Vice Chancellor at Bayero University:-\nBayero University highly regards the late Anambra-born Professor as an erudite scholar of high standing, who has left indelible footprints on the sand of time, and who earned himself a page in book of academic exploits. Expressing the University's sympathy, the Vice Chancellor, Professor, Abubakar Adamu Rasheed, Member of the National Institute, Member of the Order of the Federal Republic, ... noted that the late University don had during his tenure as the Vice Chancellor exhibited rare traits of diligence, ingenuity and phenomenal scholarship. He said the former Vice Chancellor sacrificed his time by teaching some courses during his tenure at the University.\nAfter a year in the United States, Ezeilo returned to Nigeria in\n1980\n, again taking up his position as head of the Department of Mathematics at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka. He held this post until\n[\n4\n]\n:-\n...\n1988\n, when he was appointed the founding Director and Head of the National Mathematical Centre\n(\nNMC\n)\nat Abuja. In\n1996\nProfessor Ezeilo went to University of Botswana for one year as a visiting Professor of Mathematics. Thereafter, in\n1997\nhe took up a similar post at the University of Swaziland, until his final return to Nigeria in\n2001\n. Not one to stay away from Mathematics and the academia for too long, JOC as he was popularly known, took up a position of Professor of Mathematics at the budding Ebonyi State University Abakaliki an a part-time basis in\n2002\n, remaining there until his final retirement in\n2009\n.\nScott Williams gives the following summary of Ezeilo's mathematical contributions\n[\n11\n]\n:-\nJames Ezeilo's early research dealt mainly with the problem of stability, boundedness, and convergence of solutions of third order ordinary differential equations. Apart from extending known results and techniques to higher order equations, the main thrust of his work was the construction of\nLyapunov\n-like functions, which he did elegantly and used to study the qualative properties of solutions. In addition he was a pioneer in the use of\nLeray\n-\nSchauder\ndegree type arguments to obtain existence results for periodic solutions of ordinary differential equations.\nAmong his last papers to be published we mention\nSome third order differential equations in physics\nwhich he co-authored with\nAlexander Animalu\n,\nNon resonant oscillations for some fourth order differential equations\n(\nPart I in\n1999\n, Part II in\n2001\n, Part III in\n1999)\n,\nPeriodic boundary value problems for some fourth order differential equations\n(2000)\n, and\nFurther instability theorems for some fourth order differential equations\n(2000)\n.\nThe obituaries\n[\n2\n]\nand\n[\n4\n]\nare largely identical but as each contains a little information not in the other we have produced versions of both articles.\nFor the Bayero University, Kano, obituary, see\nTHIS LINK\nand for the\nNigerian Guardian\nobituary, see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nIn\n[\n10\n]\nEzeilo's memberships and honours are listed: member,\nLondon Mathematical Society\n; member,\nAmerican Mathematical Society\n; member, Science Association of Nigeria; member, Nigerian Council for Science and Technology\n(1970\n-\n75)\n; member, Mathematical Association of Nigeria; President, Mathematical Association of Nigeria\n(1972\n-\n74)\n; member, Nigerian Mathematical Association; President, Nigerian Mathematical Association\n(1984)\n; foundation fellow, Nigerian Academy of Science; fellow, Third World Academy of Sciences\n(1986\n-\n2013)\n; fellow, African Academy of Sciences\n(1988\n-\n2013)\n; fellow, Mathematical Association of Nigeria\n(1988\n-\n2013)\n; chairman, Projects Development Agency\n(1970\n-\n74)\n; awarded Commander of the Order of the Niger\n(1979)\n; honorary D.Sc., University of Maiduguri\n(\nFebruary\n1989)\n; honorary D.Tech., University of Science and Technology, Akure\n(1995)\n; and honorary D.Sc., University of Nigeria, Nsukka\n(1996)\n.\nThe\nWho's Who in Nigeria\nentry\n[\n10\n]\ngives Ezeilo's hobby as reading.\nFollowing Ezeilo's death in\n2013\n, the\nEdward Bouchet\nAbdus Salam Institute gave this tribute\n[\n6\n]\n:-\nThe\nEdward Bouchet\nAbdus Salam InstituteÂ extends its heart-felt condolences to the family, friends, and colleagues ofÂ Founding Council Member Professor James Okoye Chukwuka Ezeilo\nÂ\nwho passed away in January of\n2013\n. Professor Ezeilo was a very animated, enterprising, philosophical but pragmatic man with plenty of ideas. He was a brilliant mathematician and fun to be around and will be greatly missed by all who knew him. We, the members ofÂ the\nEdward Bouchet\nAbdus Salam Institute, are deeply saddened by his death."
