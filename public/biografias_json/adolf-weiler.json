  "biografia": "Adolf Weiler\nwas born in Winterthur\n(\ncanton ZÃ¼rich\n)\n. After having completed his primary and secondary school education in his native town he matriculated at the Department for Mathematics Teachers at the Polytechnic in\n1868\n, graduating in\n1871\n. He worked as a private tutor for a year before studying in Germany, first at the University of GÃ¶ttingen and then at the Friedrich-Alexander-University in Erlangen, where he obtained a doctorate in\n1873\n. His supervisor was\nKlein\n, and his thesis was entitled\nÃber die verschiedenen Gattungen der Komplexe\n2\n. Grades\n(\nOn the Different Classes of Complexes of Second Order\n)\n.\nUpon his return to Switzerland, Weiler first worked as a mathematics lecturer at the Ryffel Institute in StÃ¤fa\n(\ncanton ZÃ¼rich\n)\n. In\n1878\nhe was appointed to a teaching post for mathematics at the women teachers' college in ZÃ¼rich. Weiler also\nhabilitated\nas\nPrivatdozent\nat both the Polytechnic and the University of ZÃ¼rich. He stayed at the Polytechnic, where he was also\nWilhelm Fiedler\n's assistant, from\n1875\n-\n1901\nand started his job at the University in\n1891\n. There he taught analytic and descriptive geometry, later on he also lectured on map projection. In\n1899\nhe became a Titularprofessor for geometry at the university. At the beginning of the\n20\nth\ncentury Weiler supervised five doctoral students in total, but none of them became influential mathematicians.\nWeiler's research interests lay in\nSteiner\ngeometry; in particular, he was interested in complexes and congruencies of rays. He published a range of papers on problems in descriptive geometry, axonometry and map projections. Two examples of his papers are\nNeue Behandlung der Parallelprojektionen und der Axonometrie\nâ\n(\nNew treatment of parallel projections and axonometry\n)\n(1889)\nand\nGeometrisches Ã¼ber einige Abbildungen der Kugel in der Kartenprojektion\nâ\n(\nGeometric of some pictures of the sphere in the map projection\n)\n(1903)\n.\nWeiler joined the organising committee of the first International Congress of Mathematicians in December\n1896\n, but he did not have a specific position and is not mentioned in the committee minutes\n(\nexcept for the attendance records\n)\n."
