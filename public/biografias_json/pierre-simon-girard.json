  "biografia": "Pierre-Simon Girard\n's father, Pierre Girard, was a goldsmith and watchmaker who was a strict Calvinist. Pierre-Simon's early education was in Caen where he showed a strong preference for mathematical and scientific topics. In\n1787\n, when he was twenty-one years old, he began undertaking research into mechanics at the Ãcole des Ponts et ChaussÃ©s, being particularly interested in the resistance of solids, the strength of wood as a structural material, and in structural design involving beams, walls and columns. He was greatly influenced by his teacher at the Ãcole des Ponts et ChaussÃ©s, Jacques-Ãlie Lamblardie\n(1747\n-\n1797)\n. He was appointed to the staff of the Ãcole des Ponts et ChaussÃ©s as an engineer in\n1789\n. Following this, Girard was sent to Le Havre where Lamblardie was in charge of transportation, roads and the enlargement of the harbour. It was excellent practical training for Girard, for Lamblardie's successful venture led to Le Havre becoming one of the leading ports in Europe. Then Girard was assigned to Paris and, in\n1790\n, saw that the\nAcadÃ©mie des Sciences\nhad proposed a prize on the theory of locks applied to seaports and canals, and the best methods of construction. Although the topic was different from his research on wood as a structural material, he had gained experience in Le Havre so he submitted a treatise to the\nAcadÃ©mie des Sciences\n; it won the prize.\nIn addition to Jacques-Ãlie Lamblardie, another colleague at the Ãcole des Ponts et ChaussÃ©s was\nGaspard de Prony\nand the two became close friends and collaborators. Girard and\nde Prony\nworked on geometrical problems from around\n1791\n. In\n1793\nGirard wrote to\nde Prony\nsaying:-\nI would have sent you sooner ... the numerical application ... but I have been in Amiens since the beginning of the year ... I thank you for the solution you sent me to the geometry problem...\nGirard had been in charge of planning and construction of the Amiens canal, which explains his reference to time spent in Amiens. After this\nde Prony\nand Girard decided to write a paper in which:-\n... one may learn to find the equation for some solid as one finds the equation for a curved plane.\nAnother project that Girard and\nde Prony\ncollaborated on was the\nDictionnaire des Ponts et ChaussÃ©s\nâ\n(\nDictionary of bridges and roads\n)\n. Also in\n1793\n, working with Jacques-Ãlie Lamblardie, he developed a method to measure the resistance of timbers to bending and buckling. In\n1798\nGirard published an important work\nTraitÃ© analytique de la rÃ©sistance des solides\nâ\n(\nAnalytical treatise on the resistance of solids\n)\non the strength of materials in which he described two machines for compression testing long columns of wood. His expertise came to the attention of Napoleon Bonaparte who was assembling a large expeditionary force to invade Egypt. In addition to military troops, Napoleon's force contained mathematicians, engineers, and other scientists. Girard joined Napoleon expeditionary force, which landed near Alexandria in July\n1798\n, as Assistant Director of the Ponts et ChaussÃ©es. He had the support of a team of\n24\nengineers of the Ponts et ChaussÃ©es - both military engineers and topographical engineers, and with their assistance he drew plans for the city of Alexandria, the port and the surrounding coast\n[\n1\n]\n:-\n... he soon undertook an extensive study of the surface elevation and bed characteristics of the Nile; this study eventually broadened to cover material on Egypt's agriculture, commerce, and industry ...\nNapoleon set up the Institute of Egypt close to Cairo; it contained printing presses for both Arabic and Roman characters, a library, and laboratories for physical and chemical experiments. Girad, who had been appointed as Egyptian Minister of the Interior by Napoleon, proposed to the Institute that they should explore the Nile as far as the falls. He also took part in the study of ancient monuments, including that of Nilometer, the ancient Egyptian method of measuring the height of the Nile, in the temple on Elephantine Island. When the\nMÃ©moires sur l'Egypte\nâ\n(\nMemoir on Egypt\n)\nwas published it contained many articles by Girard covering all the areas we have mentioned above. He was one of eight authors of this comprehensive report. Among his works on Egypt we mention\nMÃ©moire sur l'agriculture, l'industrie et le commerce de l'Egypte\nâ\n(\nMemoir on agriculture, industry and trade in Egypt\n)\n,\nMÃ©moire sur les Mesures Agraires des Anciens Egyptiens\nâ\n(\nMemoir on Agrarian Measures of Ancient Egyptians\n)\nand\nObservations sur la VallÃ©e d'Egypte et sur l'Exhaussement SÃ©culaire du Sol qui la recouvre\nâ\n(\nObservations on the valley of Egypt and the soil covering it\n)\n.\nHe remained in Egypt until\n1803\n, after the last of Napoleon's troops had left. After he returned to Paris, he was offered a major political position by Napoleon but he declined the offer, preferring instead the position of director of the Paris water supply. He was put in charge of the Ourcq canal project, one of many projects ordered by Napoleon to modernise Paris. While in charge of this project he was assigned a young assistant in\n1809\n, namely\nAugustin-Louis Cauchy\n. The purpose of the project was to connect the rivers Seine and Ourcq with a ship canal so that Paris was accessible by shipping\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nThis led him to study the resistance of the flow of water through pipes and open channels.\nHe described the early work in\nRapport sur le Projet GÃ©nÃ©rale du Canal de l'Ourcq\nâ\n(\nReport of the Canal Ourcq project\n)\n(1803)\n,\nDevis gÃ©nÃ©ral du Canal de l'Ourcq: depuis la premiÃ¨re prise d'eau Ã  Mareuil jusqu'Ã  la barriÃ¨re de Pantin\nâ\n(\nGeneral specifications of the Ourcq canal: from the first intake in Mareuil to the barrier of Pantin\n)\n(1806)\n, and\nDevis du pont Ã  bascule Ã  construire sur le canal de l'Ourcq\nâ\n(\nWork on the bascule bridge on the Ourcq canal\n)\n(1808)\n. The first barges reached Paris from Ourcq in\n1813\nbut after that the project ran into difficulties. In part the causes were political ones resulting from the abdication of Napoleon after the Allies captured Paris in April\n1814\n, in part they were technical difficulties resulting from landslides around the Saint-Denis area in\n1814\nand\n1815\n. Napoleon had been banished to Elba but escaped and returned to Paris in triumph in March\n1815\n. He appointed Girard, always a staunch supporter, as Divisional Inspector of Ponts et ChaussÃ©es during the famous Hundred Days. However, when the monarchy was restored after the defeat of Napoleon at Waterloo, Girard was stripped of his rank. He continued to work on the Ourcq canal scheme but became involved in difficult discussions with the city of Paris over numerous technical issues. He was removed from heading the project in\n1818\nand the construction handed over to a private company to complete the work. Girard gave a full account of the Ourcq canal project in a two volume treatise\nMÃ©moires sur le Canal de l'Ourcq et la distribution de ses eaux: sur le dessÃ¨chement et l'assainissement de Paris, et les divers canaux navigables\nâ\n(\nMemoir on the Ourcq Canal and the distribution of its waters: the drainage and sanitation of Paris, and the various navigable canals\n)\n(1831\n-\n1840)\n.\nOnce he was no longer involved in the Ourcq canal project, Girard was free to undertake other work and in\n1819\nhe was commissioned to direct a project installing gas lighting in large Paris theatres and in various neighborhoods of Paris. One of his first acts was to visit London to inspect its lighting system and water distribution. In fact he had continued in his role of director of the Paris water supply throughout all these difficult times, and he remained in this position until he retired in\n1831\n.\nIn\n[\n2\n]\nthere is a description of a visit, made along with Girard himself, of a Mr Geniey to the\n5\nkm long aqueduct supplying the water for Paris:-\nAt various points there are galleries and staircases, to descend to the subterranean aqueduct. I descended, to examine the work, with M Girard, the engineer, by a flight of steps from the cellar of a house ... Convenient arched passages are constructed under three principal streets, where one may walk, and where are laid the different mains, taking water from the aqueduct, to conduct it to the various fountains and points for distribution. They are laid upon stone blocks, or cast iron frames, so that they may be easily examined all round, from one end to the other. The beautiful fountain in the Garden of the Palais Royal, that in the Boulevard of Bondy, etc, are supplied from this water. The canal is estimated by P-S Girard, the engineer who constructed it and had the whole superintendence of distributing the water in Paris, at\n4\n,\n000\ninches of water.\nGirard wrote extensively on fluids, in particular on flow in capillary tubes; for example\nMÃ©moire sur le Mouvement des Fluides dans les Tubes capillaires, et l'Influence de la TempÃ©rature sur ce Mouvement\nâ\n(\nSubmission on fluid Movement in capillary tubes, and the influence of temperature on the movement\n)\n(1817)\n. He was honoured for his work with election to first class in the National Institute of Sciences and Arts in\n1815\n(\nthe Institute was renamed the\nAcadÃ©mie des Sciences\nin\n1816)\n; he became president in\n1830\n. He was also honoured as Chevalier of the LÃ©gion d'Honneur in\n1831\n.\nAlthough Girard was brought up a Calvinist, he was not religious and so his daughter Louise FranÃ§oise AdÃ¨le\n(\nborn\n1803)\nwas happy to convert to become a Roman Catholic before her marriage to the jurist, author and politician Charles Renouard on\n23\nMarch\n1821\n."
