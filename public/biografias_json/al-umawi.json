  "biografia": "Al-Umawi\n's full name is Abu Abdallah Yaish ibn Ibrahim ibn Yusuf ibn Simak al-Umawi. There are clear problems with his date of birth and death date. It is claimed that he died in\n1489\n, but there is a marginal note on one of his works allowing the copyist to teach the material and this note is dated\n1373\n(\nthis is not strictly true but the date given corresponds to\n1373\nafter changing calendars\n)\n. The copyist records the date he completed making the copy, also\n1373\n, and the place in which he made the copy which is Mount Qasyun in Damascus, Syria. If al-Umawi wrote his manuscript before\n1373\nhe cannot have lived to\n1489\nso one date must be incorrect but there is no other evidence as to which is correct and which is wrong. It is usual to regard al-Umawi as a\n14\nth\ncentury mathematician and we have given rough dates based on the assumption that the manuscript date is correct.\nAlthough al-Umawi lived in Damascus in Syria, he came from Andalusia in the south of Spain. The name Andalusia comes from the Arabic \"Al-Andalus\" given to this district by the Muslims who conquered it in the\n8\nth\ncentury. The unified Spanish Muslim state broke up in the early\n11\nth\ncentury but Muslims from Africa kept Spanish Islam strong into the\n14\nth\ncentury. Indeed al-Umawi was a Muslim but the mathematical scholarship of the Muslim world at this time was certainly not uniform. There were differences in the numerals used in western areas\n(\nwhich al-Umawi came from\n)\nand those used in the east. Indeed some scholars find it surprising that al-Umawi as a westerner wrote an arithmetic text for those in the east. The usual perception is that, at this time. the arithmetical skills of the east exceeded those of the west.\nTwo texts by al-Umawi which have survived are\nMarasim al-intisab fi'ilm al-hisab\n(\nOn arithmetical rules and procedures\n)\n, and\nRaf'al-ishkal fi ma'rifat al-ashkal\nwhich is a work on mensuration. It is the first of these two works which contains the\n1373\ndate referred to in the first paragraph and it is the most interesting of the two texts.\nBefore describing the\nMarasim\nwe should make some brief comments about al-Umawi's work calculating lengths and areas. In it al-Umawi gives rules for calculating: lengths of chords and lengths of arcs of circles\n(\nusing\nPythagoras\n's theorem\n)\n; areas of circles, areas of segments of circles, areas of triangles and quadrilaterals; volumes of spheres, volumes of cones and volumes of prisms. It is not a work of any great importance and Saidan, writes in\n[\n1\n]\nthat:-\n... it is a small treatise of seventeen folios in which we find nothing on mensuration that the arithmeticians of the East did not know.\nLet us now return to the more important treatise on arithmetical rules and procedures. This is the earliest surviving arithmetical treatise written by an Arab from Spain, so it is interesting to see the content of the work. After describing the very briefly the basic arithmetical operations of addition and multiplication, al-Umawi moves on to discuss the summation of series.\nAmong the series al-Umawi considers are arithmetic and geometric series. He considers the sum of the first\nn\nn\nn\npolygonal numbers\n, that is\n1\n+\n(\nr\nâ\n1\n)\nd\n1 + (r - 1)d\n1\n+\n(\nr\nâ\n1\n)\nd\nsummed from\nr\n=\n1\nr = 1\nr\n=\n1\nto\nr\n=\nn\nr = n\nr\n=\nn\n. These sums of polygonal numbers are called\npyramidal numbers\nand al-Umawi then considers the sums of the first\nn\nn\nn\npyramidal numbers. In discussing\nâ\nr\n3\n,\nâ\n(\n2\nr\n+\n1\n)\n3\n\\sum  r^{3}, \\sum  (2r+1)^{3}\nâ\nr\n3\n,\nâ\n(\n2\nr\n+\n1\n)\n3\n, and\nâ\n(\n2\nr\n)\n3\n\\sum  (2r)^{3}\nâ\n(\n2\nr\n)\n3\nal-Umawi was giving results which\nal-Karaji\nhad proved geometrically\n400\nyears earlier.\nAl-Umawi then describes casting out sevens, eights, nines, and elevens. Although he only gives these special cases, the general rule which they all obey is the following: take a number\nn\nn\nn\nwritten in decimal notation as\nn\n=\na\nq\n+\n10\na\n1\n+\n1\n0\n2\na\n2\n+\n1\n0\n3\na\n3\n+\n.\n.\n.\nn = a^{q} +10a_{1} + 10^{2}a_{2} + 10^{3}a_{3} + ...\nn\n=\na\nq\n+\n1\n0\na\n1\nâ\n+\n1\n0\n2\na\n2\nâ\n+\n1\n0\n3\na\n3\nâ\n+\n.\n.\n.\nLet\nr\nj\n=\n1\n0\nj\nr_{j} = 10^{j}\nr\nj\nâ\n=\n1\n0\nj\n(\nmod\nt\nt\nt\n)\nwhere, as far as al-Umawi is concerned,\nt\nt\nt\n=\n7\n,\n8\n,\n9\n, or\n11\n. Then if\nS\na\nj\nr\nj\nSa_{j}r_{j}\nS\na\nj\nâ\nr\nj\nâ\nis divisible by\nt\nt\nt\nso is\nn\nn\nn\n. This theorem is attributed to\nPascal\nthree hundred years after al-Umawi, and indeed al-Umawi only gives the special cases mention here. However, he does note that the sequence\nr\n1\n,\nr\n2\n,\nr\n3\n,\nr\n4\n,\nr\n5\n,\n.\n.\n.\nr_{1}, r_{2}, r_{3}, r_{4}, r_{5}, ...\nr\n1\nâ\n,\nr\n2\nâ\n,\nr\n3\nâ\n,\nr\n4\nâ\n,\nr\n5\nâ\n,\n.\n.\n.\nrecurs after finitely many steps in each of the cases he considers.\nSome results appearing in this work by al-Umawi are not found in any other Arabic arithemetics. He gives some interesting conditions for the decimal representation of a number\nn\nn\nn\nto be a square:\nn\nn\nn\nmust either end in\n00\n,\n1\n,\n4\n,\n5\n,\n6\n, or\n9\n;\nif\nn\nn\nn\nends in\n6\n, the\n10\n's place is odd, otherwise the\n10\n's place is even;\nif\nn\nn\nn\nends in\n5\nthen the\n10\n's place must be\n2\n;\nn\nn\nn\nmust leave a remainder of\n0\n,\n1\n,\n2\n, or\n4\non division by\n7\n;\nn\nn\nn\nmust leave a remainder of\n0\n,\n1\n, or\n4\non division by\n8\n;\nn\nn\nn\nmust leave a remainder of\n0\n,\n1\n,\n4\n, or\n7\non division by\n9\n.\nAl-Umawi gives similar results for\nn\nn\nn\nto be a cube including:\nn\nn\nn\nmust leave a remainder of\n0\n,\n1\n, or\n6\non division by\n7\n;\nn\nn\nn\nmust leave a remainder of\n0\n,\n1\n,\n3\n,\n5\n, or\n7\non division by\n8\n;\nn\nn\nn\nmust leave a remainder of\n0\n,\n1\n, or\n8\non division by\n9\n.\nNone of these results are hard to prove today\n(\ntry them!\n)\nwith our understanding of the decimal representation of numbers. One has to remember that these results are about decimal representations rather than about numbers themselves and show how an understanding of the decimal system was progressing at a time when Christian Europe\n(\nif I may call it that\n)\nhad little interest in anything beyond the mathematics of the ancient Greeks.\nIf you have enjoyed proving these results due to al-Umawi then here is one more he gives in the\nMarasim\n. If the integer\nn\nn\nn\nis a square and its final digit is\n1\n, then either the\n100\n's place and\n1\n2\n\\large\\frac{1}{2}\\normalsize\n2\n1\nâ\nthe\n10\n's place are both even or they are both odd."
