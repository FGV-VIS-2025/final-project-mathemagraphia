  "biografia": "Endre SzemerÃ©di\nwas born during World War II and his mother died when he was eight years old. He had two brothers but the three boys were all sent to different boarding schools for orphans. He explains in\n[\n14\n]\nhow mathematics proved useful to him in elementary school:-\n... when I was in elementary school, I was very short and weak and the stronger guys would beat me up. So I had to find somebody to protect me. I was kind of lucky, since the strongest guy in the class did not understand anything about mathematics. He could never solve the homework exercises, let alone pass the exam. So I solved the homework exercises for him and I sat next to him at the exam. Of course, we cheated and he passed the exam. But he was an honest person and he always protected me afterwards from the other big guys so I was safe. Hence my early interest in mathematics was driven more by necessity and self-interest than by anything else. In elementary school I worked a lot with mathematics but only on that level, solving elementary school exercises.\nHe did not specialise in mathematics at secondary school because his father wanted him to become a medical doctor. This was because, at this time, the medical profession was thought to be that of the highest status and best paid. Therefore he studied biology at school and, after graduating, entered medical school.\nSzemerÃ©di only spent six months at the medical school but he dropped out before the end of the first semester. He said\n[\n14\n]\n:-\nI realized that, for several reasons, it was not for me.\nThe main reasons were\n[\n16\n]\n:-\nI was not sure I could do work bearing such responsibility. You also had to study a lot, which I wasn't good at.\nNot knowing what was right for him, he took a job as a factory-hand in a machine-making factory run by the Precision Mechanics Corporation. He spent almost two years in this job before a chance event led to him becoming a mathematician.\nAt high school his best friend had been GÃ¡bor Ellmann who had been by far the best mathematician in his class. Ellmann had begun his studies of mathematics and physics at\nEÃ¶tvÃ¶s LorÃ¡nd\nUniversity in Budapest in\n1958\n. One day SzemerÃ©di was walking through the centre of Budapest when he saw Ellmann and went to chat to him. Ellmann had been going to meet his girlfriend but, as he was fifteen minutes late, she had not waited for him. SzemerÃ©di and Ellmann chatted and, naturally, Ellmann asked SzemerÃ©di what he was doing. When he heard about his factory job, Ellmann told SzemerÃ©di that he should go to\nEÃ¶tvÃ¶s LorÃ¡nd\nUniversity and study mathematics. Not only was this Ellmann's opinion but, he said, he knew that their high school mathematics teacher SÃ¡ndor Bende had always thought that SzemerÃ©di should have studied mathematics. SzemerÃ©di had always respected his friend's advice and so he did as suggested and entered\nEÃ¶tvÃ¶s LorÃ¡nd\nUniversity in\n1960\n.\nIn his first year at university, academic year\n1960\n-\n61\n, SzemerÃ©di took mathematics and physics courses with the eventual aim of becoming a high school teacher. He did not find the courses that he attended at all stimulating but continued into his second year. It was at that time that things changed dramatically for SzemerÃ©di and the person who brought about that change was\nPaul TurÃ¡n\n[\n16\n]\n:-\nTurÃ¡n gave a wonderful, all-year comprehensive course on number theory.\nHe describes how\nTurÃ¡n\n's\ncourse changed his ambitions in\n[\n14\n]\n:-\nHis lectures were perfect. Somehow he could speak to all different kinds of students, from the less good ones to the good ones. I was so impressed with these lectures that I decided I would like to be a mathematician.\nWhile an undergraduate, SzemerÃ©di collaborated with two outstanding young mathematicians AndrÃ¡s SÃ¡rkÃ¶zi and JÃ¡nos KomlÃ³s. AndrÃ¡s SÃ¡rkÃ¶zi\n(\nborn in Budapest in\n1941)\nwas a student at\nEÃ¶tvÃ¶s LorÃ¡nd\nUniversity from\n1959\nto\n1963\n. He then became a Research Fellow in the Department of Algebra and Number Theory at\nEÃ¶tvÃ¶s LorÃ¡nd\n. JÃ¡nos KomlÃ³s\n(\nborn in Budapest in\n1942)\nwas also a student at\nEÃ¶tvÃ¶s LorÃ¡nd\nUniversity. He obtained his doctorate in\n1967\nhaving been advised by\nAlfrÃ©d RÃ©nyi\n. SzemerÃ©di graduated with a Master's Degree from\nEÃ¶tvÃ¶s LorÃ¡nd\nUniversity in\n1965\n. Then, having already had three papers accepted for publication, he joined the Mathematical Research Institute of the\nHungarian Academy of Sciences\n. These three papers were\n(\nwith JÃ¡nos KomlÃ³s and AndrÃ¡s SÃ¡rkÃ¶zi\n)\nOn sums of powers of complex numbers\n(1964)\n,\n(\nwith AndrÃ¡s SÃ¡rkÃ¶zi\n)\nÃber ein Problem von ErdÅs und Moser\n(1965)\n, and\n(\nwith AndrÃ¡s SÃ¡rkÃ¶zi\n)\nOn the sequence of squares\n(1965)\n.\nAt the Mathematical Research Institute, SzemerÃ©di began to collaborate with\nPaul ErdÅs\nwho was a frequent visitor. By this time\nErdÅs\nhad no fixed position but went from one university to another around the world. However, he visited Budapest frequently since his mother continued to live in Hungary. SzemerÃ©di said\n[\n14\n]\n:-\nPaul ErdÅs\nhad many problems, conjectures. Some of them were not so hard, but the others were extremely difficult. Fortunately or unfortunately the solution to many of his problems required only elementary methods. Of course quite often the proofs using only elementary methods are not simple because one may have to put together basic ingredients in extremely complicated and sophisticated ways. Knowing that I had a very limited knowledge, I was very happy that\nPaul ErdÅs\nwas willing to work with me. With him and a fellow mathematician AndrÃ¡s SÃ¡rkÃ¶zi we wrote a large number of papers on number theory.\nIn fact SzemerÃ©di's first paper with\nErdÅs\nalso included Andras SÃ¡rkÃ¶zi as a co-author. It was the paper\nOn divisibility properties of sequences of integers\n(1966)\n. SzemerÃ©di went on to write many\n(\naround\n30)\njoint papers with\nErdÅs\nbut, in fact, this number was well beaten by his other co-author from these early days, Andras SÃ¡rkÃ¶zi, who has the record of the most joint papers with\nErdÅs\n(\naround\n50)\n. For the impressive work he had done up to this time SzemerÃ©di was awarded the GrÃ¼nwald Prize in\n1967\nby the\nJÃ¡nos Bolyai Mathematical Society\n, and he received the prize again in the following year. This prize, named for GÃ©za GrÃ¼nwald\n(1910\n-\n1943)\nwas awarded to outstanding young researchers.\nAt this stage SzemerÃ©di did not have a doctorate and, given that Hungary now had strong links with Russia and\nAlexander Gelfond\nwas a world leading number theorist, SzemerÃ©di applied to do research in Moscow with\nGelfond\nas his thesis advisor. However, an unfortunate spelling error\n(\nan \"a\" instead of an \"o\"\n)\nmeant that when he arrived in Moscow in\n1967\nhe discovered that he had been assigned to be\nIsrail Moiseevic Gelfand\n's student\n[\n14\n]\n:-\nI realised immediately that this was not for me, and\nGelfand\nalso realized it and advised me not to do mathematics anymore, telling me: \"Just try to find another profession; there are plenty in the world where you may be successful.\" I was twenty-seven years old at the time, and he had all these star students aged around twenty, and twenty-seven was considered old!\nGelfand\n's type of mathematics did not suit SzemerÃ©di at all but he did not want to give up and return to Hungary as a failure. He did have a piece of luck, however, for around the end of his first year as a doctoral student in Russia, there was a conference in Debrecen in Hungary which\nGelfond\nattended. SzemerÃ©di, as a Hungarian student who could speak Russian, was assigned to look after him and show him round. Once\nGelfond\nheard of the error that had occurred, he said that when he returned to Moscow he would arrange for SzemerÃ©di to become his student. Sadly, this was not to be since\nGelfond\ndied two months after returning to Moscow. SzemerÃ©di continued as\nGelfand\n's student, but was allowed to write his thesis on combinatorics. He had to take other examinations too and was examined by\nSergei Bernstein\non two exercises from\nAlexander Kirillov\n's publications on representation theory.\nSergei Bernstein\n[\n14\n]\n:-\n... found the error in the solution, but he said that it was the effort that I had put into it that was important rather than the result, and he let me pass the exam.\nAfter submitting his thesis, SzemerÃ©di was awarded a candidate's degree\n(\nequivalent to a Ph.D.\n)\nfrom Moscow State University in\n1970\n. Back in the Institute of Mathematics of the\nHungarian Academy of Sciences\n, SzemerÃ©di was awarded their\nAlfrÃ©d RÃ©nyi\nPrize in\n1973\nwhich was an annual award to recognise outstanding performance in mathematical research during the previous five years. By\n1973\nSzemerÃ©di had published over\n30\npapers and, two years later, in\n1975\n, he published a highly significant result which is now known as SzemerÃ©di's Theorem. This result had been conjectured in\n1936\nin the paper\nOn some sequences of integers\nby\nErdÅs\nand\nPaul TurÃ¡n\n. SzemerÃ©di's Theorem states that in any set of integers with positive density, there are arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions. Here is a precise statement of SzemerÃ©di's Theorem:\nFor every positive integer\nk\nk\nk\nand every\n1\nâ¥\nd\n>\n0\n1 â¥ d > 0\n1\nâ¥\nd\n>\n0\nthere exists an integer\nN\nN\nN\nsuch that every subset\nA\nA\nA\ncontained in\n{\n1\n,\n2\n,\n.\n.\n.\n,\nN\n}\n\\{1, 2, ..., N\\}\n{\n1\n,\n2\n,\n.\n.\n.\n,\nN\n}\nof size at least\nd\nN\ndN\nd\nN\ncontains an arithmetic progression of length\nk\nk\nk\n.\nTim Gowers\nwrites\n[\n8\n]\n:-\nThis theorem is one of the highlights of twentieth-century mathematics, but it also lies at the heart of a great deal of very recent research. He also gave us SzemerÃ©di's regularity lemma, a result that originated in the proof of SzemerÃ©di's theorem but went on to become a major tool in extremal combinatorics.\nDetails of these remarkable achievements are also given in\n[\n4\n]\n:-\nSzemerÃ©di's proof was a masterpiece of combinatorial reasoning, and was immediately recognized to be of exceptional depth and importance. A key step in the proof, now known as the SzemerÃ©di Regularity Lemma, is a structural classification of large graphs. Over time, this lemma has become a central tool of both graph theory and theoretical computer science, leading to the solution of major problems in property testing, and giving rise to the theory of graph limits. Still other surprises lay in wait. Beyond its impact on discrete mathematics and additive number theory, SzemerÃ©di's theorem inspired\nHillel Furstenberg\nto develop\nergodic theory\nin new directions.\nFurstenberg\ngave a new proof of SzemerÃ©di's theorem by establishing the Multiple Recurrence Theorem in ergodic theory, thereby unexpectedly linking questions in discrete mathematics to the theory of dynamical systems. This fundamental connection led to many further developments, such as the Green-\nTao\ntheorem asserting that there are arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions of prime numbers.\nSzemerÃ©di continued to receive prizes for his outstanding work. The\nSociety for Industrial and Applied Mathematics\nawarded him their\nPÃ³lya\nPrize for Achievement in\n1975\nand, in\n1979\n, he received the Prize of the\nHungarian Academy of Sciences\n. In\n1982\nhe was elected as a Corresponding Member of the\nHungarian Academy of Sciences\nand became a full member in\n1987\n. In\n1986\nSzemerÃ©di moved to the United States when he was appointed State of New Jersey Professor of Computer Science at Rutgers University. However, he continued to hold his professorship at the\nAlfrÃ©d RÃ©nyi\nInstitute of Mathematics of the\nHungarian Academy of Sciences\nin Budapest. In addition to continuing to hold these two positions, SzemerÃ©di held several visiting professorships: Stanford University,\n1974\n; McGill University,\n1980\n; University of Southern California,\n1981\n-\n1983\n; University of Chicago,\n1985\n-\n1986\n; Fairchild Distinguished Scholar, California Institute of Technology,\n1987\n-\n1988\n; Aisenstadt Chair at Centre de Recherche MathÃ©matique in Montreal,\n2003\n; Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton,\n2007\n-\n2008\nand\n2009\n-\n2010\n; and Eisenbud Professor, Mathematical Sciences Research Institute, Berkeley,\n2008\n.\nAfter the prizes we have mentioned above, SzemerÃ©di was awarded: the Leroy P Steele Prize of the\nAmerican Mathematical Society\nfor Seminal Contribution to Research,\n2008\n:-\n... for his paper \"On sets of integers containing no k elements in arithmetic progression\";\nHe won the Rolf Schock Prize in Mathematics decided by the\nRoyal Swedish Academy of Sciences\n,\n2008\n; the DeLong Lecture Series, University of Colorado,\n2010\n; the\nAbel\nPrize,\n2012\n[\n4\n]\n:-\n... for his fundamental contributions to discrete mathematics and theoretical computer science, and in recognition of the profound and lasting impact of these contributions on additive number theory and ergodic theory;\nHe received the George Washington Prize, from the American Hungarian Foundation, at a dinner held at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel, New York City on\n14\nNovember\n2012\n.\nAnother honour given to SzemerÃ©di is described in\n[\n12\n]\n:-\nIn\n2010\n, on the occasion of SzemerÃ©di's\n70\nth\nbirthday, the\nAlfrÃ©d RÃ©nyi\nInstitute of Mathematics and the\nJÃ¡nos Bolyai Mathematical Society\norganized a conference in Budapest to celebrate his achievements. In the book, 'An Irregular Mind', published prior to the conference, it is stated that \"SzemerÃ©di has an 'irregular mind'; his brain is wired differently than for most mathematicians. Many of us admire his unique way of thinking, his extraordinary vision.\"\nAlso in\n2010\nSzemerÃ©di was awarded an honorary doctorate by the Charles University of Prague.\nSumming up SzemerÃ©di's achievements up to\n2012\n,\nTim Gowers\nwrites\n[\n8\n]\n:-\nSome mathematicians are famous for one or two major theorems. Others are famous for a huge and important body of high-class results. Very occasionally, there is a mathematician who is famous for both. No account of SzemerÃ©di's work would be complete without a discussion of SzemerÃ©di's theorem and SzemerÃ©di's regularity lemma. However, there is much more to SzemerÃ©di than just these two theorems. He has published over\n200\npapers, as I mentioned at the beginning, and at the age of\n71\nhe shows no signs of slowing down.\nSzemerÃ©di claims in\n[\n16\n]\nto be a professor of computer science who does not know how to use a computer:-\nI don't know computers, despite the fact that I work at the Department of Computer Science at Rutgers University. I can prove that my wife answers all my emails. I read them, but I don't know how to use the calculator - I mean computer, I just sometimes call it a calculator.\n[\nI don't learn to use a computer because\n]\nI'm just simply too stupid for it, I don't understand the whole thing. I understand the internet, that's just a graph, I can model it. But the computer, programming languages, how to search for information, I don't know. I'm also incompetent with cameras, I never learned how to take pictures. And I can't turn the DVD player on, I am helpless if my wife doesn't start the movie I want to watch, or one of my grandchildren doesn't come over to help me out.\nIn\n[\n16\n]\nSzemerÃ©di describes some of his hobbies:-\nI used to love to take walks, but since I've been having hip problems, that is more difficult. I play tennis once a week, but with a trainer who hits the ball so that it bounces right in front of me; I don't even have to move. Two months ago I started playing ping pong. I watch movies with my family, we go to the theatre, I watch any kind of sport on TV. If you ask me about that, I can tell you anything: I have been following sports for decades. Soccer, Formula\n1\n, basketball, even seemingly boring sports like baseball or football. Tennis too, of course. I can't play tennis well, but when the game starts, I see immediately what Nadal's strategy is. You don't have to be a mathematician to do that, only a sports fanatic.\nSzemerÃ©di is married to Anna Kepes\n(\nborn\n1945)\n; they have five children. Anna Kepes SzemerÃ©di edited the book\nArt in the Life of Mathematicians\n(2015)\n. A number of leading mathematicians contributed their thoughts on art, painting, music, dance, photography etc. for this book. Anna organised an exhibition \"Art in the World of Mathematicians\" for her husband's\n70\nth\nbirthday and the book grew out of the exhibition.\nLet us end by quoting Michael Littman, chairman of the Department of Computer Science at Rutgers University\n[\n11\n]\n:-\nMathematicians are people, too. Some are arrogant and obnoxious. Some are truly humane. SzemerÃ©di is a sweet, sweet man. He has these warm smiling eyes, a nice calm way about him. He's very magnanimous, very generous. He doesn't think he's the only one who works in this field in the world."
