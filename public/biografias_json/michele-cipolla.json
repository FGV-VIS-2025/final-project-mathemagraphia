  "biografia": "Michele Cipolla\n's parents were Luigi Cipolla and Rosalia Moncada. He attended secondary school in Palermo, following which he entered the Scuola Normale in Pisa. In Pisa he was taught by several outstanding mathematicians but was particularly attracted to the courses given by\nLuigi Bianchi\nand\nUlisse Dini\n. He attended\nBianchi\n's lectures on number theory, and his lectures on group theory and\nGalois\ntheory, which strongly influenced him to undertake research in algebra. After two years in Pisa, Cipolla returned to Palermo where he studied for his doctorate at the university under Gabriele Torelli's supervision. Torelli\n(1849\n-\n1931)\nhad been appointed as Professor of Algebra at Palermo in\n1891\nand played a major role in applying the theory of functions to the study of prime numbers. He had received the mathematical prize of the Naples Academy in\n1899\nfor his work on the totality of primes. Cipolla was awarded his doctorate from Palermo in\n1902\nfor his thesis on asymptotic determinations of primes. He published\nLa determinazione assintotica dell'n imo numero primo\nâ\n(\nThe determination of the n asymptotics of a prime number\n)\nin\n1902\n,\nUn metodo per la risolutione della congruenza di secondo grado\nâ\n(\nA method for the resolution of the congruence of the second degree\n)\nin\n1903\n, and\nSui numeri composti P, che verificanola congruenza di Fermat\na\nP\nâ\n1\n=\n1\n(\nm\no\nd\nP\n)\na^{P-1} = 1 (mod P)\na\nP\nâ\n1\n=\n1\n(\nm\no\nd\nP\n)\nâ\n(\nOn composite numbers P , which satisfy Fermat's congruence  a\nP-\n1\n=\n1\n(\nmod P\n)\n)\nin\nAnnali di Matematica\nin\n1904\n. This contains his famous results on infinitely many pseudoprimes to a given base\na\na\na\n.\nWhen he had been in Pisa, Cipolla had been introduced to group theory in\nBianchi\n's lectures. While at Palermo, although doing research for his doctorate in number theory, he attended the seminars led by\nFrancesco Gerbaldi\nin which he introduced students to the latest results in mathematics including group theory. Although an extremely productive mathematician, in\n1904\nCipolla became a secondary school teacher in Corleone, a small town about\n35\nkm south of Palermo. There he lived in the house of a Mr Lisi whose two sisters also lived there\n[\n9\n]\n:-\nThe house was comfortable, secluded, and there Cipolla found the atmosphere and the serenity necessary to carry out some of his research.\nExcept for walking with Lisi and another tenant who lived in the house, and occasionally being invited for coffee in the afternoon with Mr Lisi's sisters, he stayed in his room working on mathematical research.\nHe taught at the Regio Ginnasio \"G Baccelli\" in Corleone until\n1911\nbut, despite devoting much time to his teaching duties, he was very active in mathematical research, doing some of his most creative work during these years. He published papers such as\nEstensione delle formole di Meissel-Rogel e di Torelli sulla totalitÃ  dei numeri primi che non superano un numero assegnato\nâ\n(\nExtension of the formulas of Meissel-Rogel and Torelli on all primes not exceeding a given number\n)\n(1905)\n,\nSulla risoluzione apiristica delle congruenze binomie secondo un modulo primo\nâ\n(\nOn the resolution of binomial congruences  module a prime number\n)\n(1906)\n,\nSulla teoria dei gruppi abeliani\nâ\n(\nOn the theory of Abelian groups\n)\n(1908)\n, and\nSulla struttura dei gruppi d'ordine finito\nâ\n(\nOn the structure of groups of finite order\n)\n(1909)\n. Laura Martini writes\n[\n5\n]\n:-\nCipolla was one of the most remarkable Italian algebraists in his days. His scientific interests covered several fields of study, among them, number theory, the theory of finite groups, analysis, foundations, and the history and pedagogy of mathematics. He published some one hundred works in addition to a series of texts written for secondary school and a number of remarkable university-level treatises. Between\n1909\nand\n1912\n, in particular, he defined the notion of fundamental subgroups of a group and published his results in four memoirs in the 'Rendiconti della Accademia delle Scienze di Napoli'.\nIn\n1911\nCipolla was appointed as Professor of Algebraic Analysis at the University of Catania, in the town of Catania on the east coast of Sicily. One of his publications during this period was\nSulle equazioni algebriche le cui radici sono tutte radici dell'unitÃ\nâ\n(\nOn algebraic equations whose roots are roots of unity\n)\n(1914)\nand another was the innovative monograph\nAnalisi algebraica ed introduzione al calcolo infinitesimale\nâ\n(\nAlgebraic analysis and introduction to calculus\n)\n.\nErnst Jacobsthal\nwrites in a review:-\nA book that contains much more than its title promises.\nFrom\n1916\n, Cipolla was joined in Catania by\nGaetano Scorza\nwho also worked on group theory and had generalised some of Cipolla's work on finite groups to infinite groups. Cipolla's most famous publication on group theory is his three-volume treatise\nTeoria dei gruppi di ordine finito e sue applicazioni\nâ\n(\nTheory of  groups of finite order and applications\n)\nwhich appeared between\n1919\nand\n1923\n[\n5\n]\n:-\nThe work includes the theory of abstract groups, the theory of groups of substitutions, and\nGalois\n's theory of algebraic equations. In it, Cipolla gathered the lectures on group theory and\nGalois theory\nhe had given at the University of Catania in the academic years\n1920\n-\n1921\nand\n1921\n-\n1922\n, and it can be considered the most complete treatise written in the Italian language on classical\nGalois\ntheory.\nIn\n1921\na new periodical was started by the Circolo Matematico di Catania called\nEsercitazioni Matematiche\n. It was intended to be read by university students and was edited by Cipolla. He published a number of articles in this periodical including\nNulla e zero\nâ\n(\nNothing and zero\n)\nin\n1937\n. Albert A Bennett writes in a review:-\nThe author describes the notion off the null class and discusses its introduction and the symbols used to represent it, in the history of symbolic logic. The number zero \"late child of nothing\" is treated historically in connection with algebra and the digit zero is considered in connection with place notation among the classical writers. The important philosophical value of the number zero for mathematics and physical sciences is stressed.\nIn\n1923\n, the year in which the third volume of his group theory treatise was published, Cipolla returned to Palermo where he was appointed as professor. He remained in this post for the rest of his life. He continued to publish work on group theory with papers such as\nI sottogruppi fondamentali di un gruppo di HÃ¶lder\nâ\n(\nThe fundamental subgroups of a group of HÃ¶lder\n)\n(1926)\n, and on finite fields with papers such as\nFormule di risoluzione apiristica delle equazioni di grado qualunque in un corpo finito\nâ\n(\nFormulas for the resolution of equations of any degree in a finite field\n)\n(1930)\n. His textbook\nLa matematica elementare nei suoi fondamenti, nei riguardi didattici e negli sviluppi superiori\nâ\n(\nElementary mathematics in its foundations, towards learning and higher education developments\n)\nproved very popular. It was first published in\n1927\nwith a second edition in\n1929\n, and finally a third edition appeared in\n1949\nafter Cipolla's death. With his student Gaspare Mignosi\n(1875\n-\n1951)\n, who worked with him in Catania and determined the fundamental subgroups of the linear projective group of dimension two over a finite field, Cipolla wrote secondary school level textbooks such as\nAnalisi matematiche elementare\nâ\n(\nElementary mathematical analysis\n)\n(1924)\n,\nLezioni di Algebra per il liceo classico, per il biennio del liceo scientifico e dell'istituto tecnico nautico\nâ\n(\nAlgebra lessons for high school, for the two years of scientific and technical naval high schools\n)\nand\nGeometria elementare per Ginnasi Superiori e i Licei : vol.\n1\n(\nper il Ginnasio superiore\n)\n: vol.\n2\n- Pei Licei : preparazione alla prova scritta di Matematica negli Esami di MaturitÃ  Scientifica\nâ\n(\nElementary Geometry for high schools: vol.\n1\n(\nfor the upper Grammar\n)\n: vol.\n2\n- For high schools: preparation for the written exam of mathematics in the school leaving exams\n)\n. Also with Vincenzo Amato\n(1881\n-\n1963)\n, another of his students in Catania who studied the properties of those algebraic equations whose\nGalois\ngroup was the fundamental subgroup of the whole group, he wrote secondary school texts such as\nAlgebra elementare : per il ginnasio superiore e per le classi\n3\ne\n4\ndell'istituto magistrale inferiore\nâ\n(\nElementary algebra for upper secondary school and for classes\n3\nand\n4\nof lower institutes\n)\n(1926)\n, and\nAritmetica prattica per le scuole industriale. Vol. I\nâ\n(\nPractical arithmetic for industrial schools. Vol.\n1\n)\n(1927)\n. Among his other books we mention\nLezioni di calcolo infinitesimale\nâ\n(\nLessons in infinitesimal calculus\n)\n(1925)\n, and we mention that he also wrote historical articles such as\nEvaristo Galois nel primo centenario della sua morte\nâ\n(\nEvarist Galois at the first centenary of his death\n)\n(1934)\n, and\nIl contributo italiano alla renascita della matematica nel Duecento\nâ\n(\nThe Italian contribution to the rebirth of mathematics in the thirteenth century\n)\n(1935)\n.\nCipolla received many honours for his outstanding contributions to mathematics and mathematical education, such as being elected Vice President of the\nCircolo Matematico di Palermo\n. He was also elected a member of the Accademia Gioenia di Catania, the Pontaniana di Napoli and the\nAccademia dei Lincei\n. He has also been honoured with the 'Liceo Scientifico Statale Michele Cipolla' in Castelvetrano, Sicily being dedicated to him. Also in Castelvetrano the 'Via Michele Cipolla' is named for him, while in Palermo there is a 'Via Michele Cipolla' on which the Universita' Degli Studi Di Palermo is situated.\nFinally let us quote from Guido Zappa and Giovanni Zacher\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nNearly half a century after his death, Michele Cipolla seems like a very significant personality in Italian mathematics in the first half of this century. At a time when, in our country, Algebra and Number Theory were little studied, he managed to create a school which, although geographically limited, helped to keep alive interest in these disciplines."
