  "biografia": "Arnold Droz-Farny\nadopted the name Farny later in life after he married. He was named Arnold Droz, and was the son of Ãdouard Droz and his wife Louise. He studied mathematics in the canton of NeufchÃ¢tel and then continued his studies in Munich where he attended analysis lectures by\nKlein\n. By this time he had developed a strong preference for geometry. He married Lina Farny who was also from La Chaux-de-Fonds. She was the daughter of Constant and Anna Farny, and was a little older than her husband being born on\n26\nApril\n1854\n. On marriage they both changed their name to Droz-Farny.\nAfter studying in Munich, he was appointed as a teacher \"in an important institute of German-speaking Switzerland\".  In\n1880\nDroz-Farny was appointed as a professor of physics and mathematics at the cantonal School in Porrentruy near Basel in Switzerland. He taught there until\n1908\n.\nEduardo L Ortiz writes\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nAll I know of his personal life is that he seems to have been very sociable, liked mountain climbing and horse races, and kept correspondence with a number of mathematicians, among them Virginio Retali in Italy, and Juan Jacobo Duran Loriga in Spain. With the latter he kept correspondence between\n1889\nto\n1910\nwhen Duran Loriga died.\nAyme writes\n[\n1\n]\n:-\n[\nDroz-Farny\n]\nis known to have written four books between\n1897\nand\n1909\n, two of them about geometry. He also published in the Journal de MathÃ©matiques Ã©lemantaires et SpÃ©ciales\n(1894\n,\n1895)\n, and in L'intermÃ©diare des MathÃ©maticiens and in the Educational Times\n(1899)\nas well as in Mathesis\n(1901)\n.\nDroz-Farny is best known for results published in the publications of\n1899\nand\n1901\nmentioned in this quote. The first of these was\nQuestion\n14111\nin\nThe Educational Times\n71\n(1899)\n,\n89\n-\n90\n. In this he stated the following remarkable theorem without giving a proof:\nIf two perpendicular straight lines are drawn through the orthocentre of a triangle, they intercept a segment on each of the sidelines. The midpoints of these three segments are collinear.\nThis is known as the Droz-Farny line theorem, but it is not known whether Droz-Farny had a proof of the theorem. Looking at other work by Droz-Farny, one is led to conjecture that indeed he would have constructed a proof of the theorem.\nYou can see the diagram for the Droz-Farny line theorem at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nThe\n1901\npaper we mentioned above is, for example, one in which he gives a proof of a theorem stated by\nSteiner\nwithout proof. Droz-Farny's proof appears in the paper\nNotes sur un thÃ©orÃ¨me de Steiner\nâ\n(\nNotes on Steiner's theorem\n)\nin\nMathesis\n21\n(1901)\n,\n268\n-\n271\n. The theorem is as follows:\nIf equal circles are drawn on the vertices of a triangle they cut the lines joining the midpoints of the triangle in six points. These six points lie on a circle whose centre is the orthocentre of the triangle.\nYou can see the diagram for the Droz-Farny circle theorem at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nDroz-Farny died of \"a long and painful disease\"."
