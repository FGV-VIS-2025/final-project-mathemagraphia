  "biografia": "Reuben R McDaniel\nwas the son of the African American farmer Birl McDaniel\n(1868\n-\n1937)\nand his wife Annie Turner\n(1868\n-\n1951)\n. Birl McDaniel had born in Cedar Mountain, Culpeper, Virginia and had married Annie Turner in Orange County, Virginia on\n21\nJune\n1893\n. Birl and Annie McDaniel had six children, four girls and two boys: Lillie C McDaniel\n(1894\n-\n1973)\n; Maria J McDaniel\n(1896\n-\n1943)\n; John Amos McDaniel\n(1898\n-\n1971)\n, who became a Government clerk; Mary Gertrude McDaniel\n(1899\n-\n1976)\n; Eleanor Freeman McDaniel\n(1900\n-\n1986)\n; and Reuben Roosevelt McDaniel\n(1902\n-\n1975)\n, the subject of this biography.\nLet us note at this point that there are various inconsistencies in the biographies of Reuben McDaniel. For example his date of death is given as\n4\nJuly\n1974\nin all the biographies we have seen, yet his death certificate available from\n[\n10\n]\ngives\n19\nJanuary\n1975\nand his tombstone gives\n19\nJanuary\n1975\n. We will not list other inconsistencies but attempt to give as accurate information here as we can.\nReuben McDaniel attended Hughesville School in Centreville, Fairfax County. beginning his education there in\n1909\n[\n3\n]\n:-\nBy the early\n20\nth century, the length of the school year for white children had been extended to six months, but the school year for African-American children was only five months long.\nMinnie Beckwith Hughes\n(1871\n-\n1975)\nwas the teacher at Hughesville School from\n1911\nto\n1916\nso she taught McDaniel for the last three of his five years at school. She had married Edward Hughes, who was also a teacher, in\n1902\n. Both Edward and Minnie Hughes were the children of slaves. Minnie said\n[\n4\n]\n:-\nDuring my career, I often thought of the lines: \"I shot an arrow into the air. It fell to earth I know not where.\" A teacher daily shoots the arrow of knowledge and hopes it will find its mark in the hearts and minds of the students. Frequently the evidence of its having found its mark is not apparent for years.\nThis is an interesting comment since clearly one of her arrows found its mark with McDaniel. Let us note that, after Minnie Hughes left Hughesville School in\n1916\n, Lillie C McDaniel, Reuben McDaniel's eldest sibling, was appointed as the teacher at this school.\nReuben McDaniel studied at Hughesville School for five years, the required length of schooling which had to be taken by African Americans at this time. He then began to work for his father on their\n75\nacre farm. His relationship with his father, however, deteriorated. Reuben had ideas about how to obtain better yields by rotating crops. He read articles about how rotating crops would improve the harvest but his father did not want advice from his young son on methods of farming, saying that he had the experience in farming. Reuben's sister Maria had married William Moore on\n16\nJune\n1917\nand, after her marriage, was living in Washington, District of Columbia. William Moore was a labourer, working in a shop, and Maria made extra money by working as a laundress in her own home. To make Reuben's life easier and allowing him to get away from the difficult feud with his father, he went to live with William and Maria Moore in Washington D.C.\nIn Washington, Reuben took a job delivering mail. He was not, however, content to spend his life doing such jobs and wanted to continue his education. Garnet Crummell Wilkinson\n(1879\n-\n1969)\nhad studied at M Street High School in Washington D.C., the first public high school for African American students and at Oberlin College before studying for an LLB at Howard University Law School and later a Master's Degree from the University of Pennsylvania. M Street High School was renamed Dunbar High School in\n1916\n, the year Wilkinson became its principal. With advice from Wilkinson, Reuben McDaniel was able to complete his elementary education at night school while continuing his job delivering mail.\nThe following story was related by Reuben McDaniel's daughter Joann Phillips\n[\n5\n]\n:-\nOne of Reuben's mail stops was the US Navy Department where Reuben made friends with a white man named Franklin Delano Roosevelt\n(\nlater President of the United States\n)\n, who suggested Reuben attend high school. But high school was only for the day time, so Roosevelt found a night job for Reuben and registered Reuben into Dunbar High School.\nI\n[\nEFR\n]\nfind the coincidence of Reuben McDaniel's middle name being Roosevelt and that it was Franklin D Roosevelt who arranged for him to continue his education as surprising. I have tried to check whether indeed Reuben was given the name Roosevelt or whether he adopted it in honour of the help he received from Franklin D Roosevelt. All that is certain in the data is that he was given the name Reuben R McDaniel. The fact that others with the name McDaniel in the same area had the name Roosevelt, would make it likely that he was registered with that name at birth. Another point to note is that when he later studied at university he used the name Reuben Roosvelt McDaniel\n(\nwith no 'e' in Roosvelt\n)\nand the spelling Roosvelt appears on his theses. The spelling Roosvelt also appears on his marriage certificate.\nAt Dunbar High School, the school where Garnet Crummell Wilkinson was principal, McDaniel did well, in fact so well that in\n1924\nhe was awarded a Rutgers University general scholarship to study at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey. This scholarship supported him during his four years at Rutgers from\n1924\nto\n1928\n. At Rutgers he majored in mathematics and physics. He was inducted into Phi Beta Kappa during his junior year and graduated from Rutgers in June\n1928\nwith a Bachelor of Science degree. After graduating, he was appointed in June\n1928\nas an instructor to teach physics and mathematics at Shaw University in Raleigh, North Carolina. This university was the first institution of higher education for African Americans in the South and, being founded in\n1865\n, was among the oldest such institutions in the United States. At the time of the\n1930\nUS Census, McDaniel is recorded as living at the University, one of\n17\nteachers there. The president of the University was Joseph Leishman Peacock\n(1873\n-\n1954)\nwho had been born in Paisley, Scotland, of Scottish parents.\nMcDaniel taught at Shaw University until February\n1931\n, and was then appointed as an Assistant Professor of Mathematics at Virginia State College, Petersburg, Virginia, taking up the appointment in September\n1931\n. He had been studying at Cornell University for a Master's Degree and he was awarded a Master of Science degree by Cornell on\n30\nSeptember\n1931\nhaving written the thesis\nOn Certain Definitions of the Definite Integral\n. While teaching at Virginia State College he met Nannie Delilah Finney, the daughter of Robert Louis Finney and his wife Nannie Dungee. Nannie Finney had been born in Cumberland Virginia on\n8\nMay\n1908\nand had attended Virginia Normal and Industrial Institute before studying at Virginia State College. There\n[\n8\n]\n:-\n... she completed the two year certificate in secretarial science becoming the first graduate of the newly established Department of Business.\nReuben and Nannie McDaniel had two children. Their first child was Reuben Roosevelt McDaniel Jr. who was born on\n6\nJanuary\n1936\nat Petersburg, Fauquier, Virginia. He had an outstanding career: B.S. degree in mechanical engineering from Drexel University\n(1964)\n, M.A. from the University of Akron\n(1968)\n, and an Ed.D. in higher education from Indiana University\n(1971)\n. His career in university education led to numerous awards and recognitions. He died in February\n2016\n. Reuben and Nannie McDaniel also had a daughter, Joann Beryl McDaniel, born on\n23\nMay\n1943\nwho attended Peabody High School in Petersburg. She married Roosevelt Delano Phillips on\n31\nDecember\n1964\n. Roosevelt Phillips was a TV film technician working for the Petersburg TV Corporation. They were divorced on\n29\nMay\n1981\n.\nIn October\n1936\nMcDaniel matriculated at Cornell University as a candidate for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy. For\n1936\n-\n1937\nhe was granted a General Education Board Fellowship, and for\n1937\n-\n1938\nthe Erastus Brooks Fellowship in Mathematics at Cornell University. His doctoral studies were supervised by Burton Wadsworth Jones\n(1902\n-\n1983)\nwho had studied for his Ph.D. at Chicago advised by\nL E Dickson\n. Burton W Jones had been awarded his Ph.D. in\n1928\nfor his thesis\nRepresentation by Positive Ternary Quadratic Forms\n. McDaniel was awarded a Ph.D. from Cornell University in\n1938\nfor his thesis\nApproximation to Algebraic Numbers by Means of Periodic Sequences of Transformations on Quadratic Forms\n. The thesis begins\n[\n7\n]\n:-\nCharles Hermite\nin the latter part of his second letter to Jacobi makes use of his reduction of quadratic forms to develop a periodic sequence of transformations for a sequence of ternary reduced forms ... . Leon Charve using principally the same method but a reduction due to Selling develops a similar periodic sequence for quadratic ternary forms. The present thesis extends the process used by\nHermite\nand later by Charve to quadratic n-ary forms ...\nIn the thesis McDaniel gives the following Acknowledgement\n[\n7\n]\n:-\nThe author wishes to express his sincere appreciation to Professor Burton W Jones, who suggested the problem, for his guidance and constructive criticism in the writing of this thesis.\nMcDaniel also notes in the Vita that:-\nHe is a member of the National Honor Society for Secondary Schools, Phi Beta Kappa, Sigma Xi, the\nAmerican Mathematical Society\nand the Virginia conference of Science and Mathematics Teachers.\nWe note that when McDaniel was awarded a Ph.D. in mathematics in\n1938\nhe became the fifth African American to be awarded such a degree. The four before him were\nElbert Frank Cox\n(\nCornell University,\n1925)\n,\nDudley Weldon Woodard\n(\nUniversity of Pennsylvania,\n1928)\n,\nWilliam Schieffelin Claytor\n(\nUniversity of Pennsylvania,\n1933)\n, and\nWalter Richard Talbot\n(\nUniversity of Pittsburgh,\n1934)\n.\nAfter the award of his Ph.D., McDaniel's return to Virginia State College was announced in\nThe Sphinx\n[\n15\n]\n:-\nWe are happy to announce the return of Brother R R McDaniel, whose brilliant scholastic record and achievements should be an inspiration to all men. Brother McDaniel, on leave of absence, a Phi Beta Kappa Key man from Ruthers and an M.S. from Cornell. He returns to us a Ph.D. in mathematics from Cornel and a member of Sigma Xi, honorary society, of the same institution, to resume his duties as head of the Department of Mathematics. The title of Brother McDaniel's thesis is \"Approximation to Algebraic Numbers by Means of Periodic Sequences of Transformations on Quadratic Forms.\"\nMcDaniel's wife, Nannie, studied for a Bachelor of Science degree in Business Administration, a Master of Science Degree in Business Administration, and then did graduate study in Business at The University of Wisconsin and New York University. She taught in the Business Department of Virginia State College giving courses on secretarial science, economics and business\n[\n8\n]\n:-\nNannie worked at Virginia State in administrative roles including secretary to the Dean of the College, in the Veteran's Administration Office and supervisor of the Central Stenographic Pool. After receiving her Master's degree, she accepted a position on the faculty of the Business Department where she taught courses in secretarial science, economics and introduction to business. Mrs Mac's classes gave students practical skills that would serve them throughout their lives as well as a high level understanding of the business world. Her legacy as a professor extends far and wide.\nBoth Reuben and Nannie McDaniel were important people in the College\n[\n8\n]\n:-\nNannie and Mac were a major presence at Virginia State College. Card parties at their home were known for good bridge, great gossip and wonderful food. They never skipped convocation, commencement, honour's day or a home football game. Students were always welcome in their home, where they could get tutoring, the chance to pick up some money doing an odd job or two, or comfort at a time of family crisis. Young faculty members were as welcome at their home as the College president. The McDaniels could be counted on and Nannie was the foundation of that home.\nWe learn something of McDaniel as a teacher from Rheba Elaine Fearn\n(1931\n-\n2020)\nwho graduated from Virginia State College in\n1951\n[\n10\n]\n:-\nMrs Fearn continued her education at Virginia State University, like her mother before her, where she majored in Mathematics. Rheba was taught by legendary professors, Dr John M Hunter, who later became Chairman of the Physics Department, and Dr Reuben McDaniel, Sr., Chairman of the Mathematics Department. The two had tremendously high expectations of their students and challenged them to aspire to become the best version of themselves. Mrs Fearn accepted their challenge and thrived under their instruction and mentorship. Â Her life-long friend, sorority sister, and classmate Dr Gladys Mae West did as well. Dr West is known for her contributions to the mathematical modelling of the shape of the earth, and her work on the development of Global Positioning System\n(\nGPS\n)\n.\nBoth Reuben and Nannie McDaniel were active members of the Zion Baptist Church in Petersburg, Virginia. Reuben introduced Walter Elias\n(1931\n-\n2018)\nto this church early in Elias' career at Virginia State. We note that Elias went on to serve at professor of mathematics at Virginia State becoming head of mathematics. Nannie McDaniel joined the Zion Baptist Church in Petersburg in\n1943\nand was church treasurer for twenty years.\nIn\n1949\n, McDaniel was appointed as acting dean at Virginia State College, then as Director of the School of Arts and Sciences. He continued to serve at Virginia State College until he retired\n[\n8\n]\n:-\nAfter retiring from Virginia State, Nannie and Mac enjoyed a short but active retirement until Mac's death in January,\n1975\n.\nMcDaniel began to suffer poor health and was diagnosed with cancer. When his condition deteriorated, he was taken to the Medical College of Virginia Hospital where he died of arrhythmia due to \"disseminated carcinoma of the rectum and prostate.\" He was buried in Blandford Cemetery in Petersburg, Virginia.\nNannie McDaniel had a long career following the death of her husband, serving as Academic Dean at Morristown Junior College in Morristown, Tennessee, then working for twenty years for the Virginia State College Federal Credit Union. She died on\n26\nJune\n2009\n, aged\n101\n, and was buried beside her husband in Blandford Cemetery."
