  "biografia": "Pierre MÃ©chain\n's parents were Pierre-FranÃ§ois MÃ©chain and Marie-Marguerite Roze. Pierre-FranÃ§ois, a plasterer who specialised in plastering ceilings, was a man of modest means. Pierre was born in Loan, a medieval town in the Picardy region of northern France. The picturesque old town, situated on the summit of a scarped hill, lies northwest of Reims and northeast of Paris. It was in Loan that Pierre was educated by the Jesuits and as a young boy his aim was to become an architect, although his main hobby was astronomy. His ability at mathematics was soon spotted, however, and he was advised to study at the Ãcole Nationale des Ponts et ChaussÃ©es in Paris.\nIn\n1716\nthe Bridge and Highway Corps had been founded in Paris and, in\n1747\nwhen MÃ©chain was still a small child, it became the Ãcole Nationale des Ponts et ChaussÃ©es. It was a prestigious institution founded to train civil engineers and its teachers wrote books that became standard works on the mechanics of materials, machines, and hydraulics. Studying there was, however, expensive and MÃ©chain's father did not have the necessary resources to be able to support his son. MÃ©chain had to interrupt his studies and take on the role of tutor to two young boys from a noble family some\n50\nkm from Paris.\nHis tutoring position put MÃ©chain on a firmer financial footing and he was able to save enough to buy some good quality astronomical instruments so that he could pursue his hobby. We now quote a story from\n[\n2\n]\nwhich is based on MÃ©chain's own account:-\n... calamity struck. His father lost a crippling lawsuit, and the son ... loyally agreed to sell his instruments to pay off the family debt. This setback proved his first stroke of fortune. His instruments were purchased by JÃ©rÃ´me\nLalande\n...\nThis romantic story may not be true for\nDelambre\n, who knew MÃ©chain very well over a period of ten years, stated in his biography of MÃ©chain, written many years after his death, that there was no evidence to support the story. Whether the story is true or not, what is undoubtedly the case is that MÃ©chain made contact with\nLalande\nwho sent him proofs of the second edition of his\nTraitÃ© d'astronomie\nâ\n(\nTreatise on astronomy\n)\n. MÃ©chain's assistance with the proofs soon impressed\nLalande\n, as did his enthusiasm and abilities, so, seeing the benefits of having him enter his profession, he arranged a position for him in the cartography department in the DepÃ´t de la Marine in Versailles in\n1772\n. The position was not well paid and, certainly at first, MÃ©chain had to tutor mathematics to make enough money to live on.\nGingerich writes in\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nThe archives were then a seat of political patronage and intrigue, and, caught in the political crosscurrents, MÃ©chain twice lost his job; but each time he was reinstated because of his competence as a map-maker. The archives were soon transferred to Paris, and there he drew up the maps of the shoreline from Nieuwpoort in Flanders to Saint-Malo.\nMÃ©chain went to Paris in the permanent position of calculator in the DepÃ´t de la Marine, living there from around\n1774\n. He became friendly with Charles Messier who worked in the same department and the two observed from the Hotel de Cluny in Paris where\nLalande\nhad observed\n25\nyears earlier. In\n1777\nMÃ©chain married Barbe-ThÃ©rÃ¨se Marjou, whom he met while working in Versaille. They had two sons, JÃ©rÃ´me-Isaac born\n1780\nand Augustin born\n1784\n, and a daughter. Their eldest son was named after\nLalande\nwho was his godfather.\nFor the next ten years from\n1780\nto\n1790\nMÃ©chain undertook surveys to produce maps and also worked in astronomy where he is particularly famed as a discoverer of comets. Some of the maps were produced for military purposes like those of Germany and north Italy which he worked on from\n1780\n. Others, like that carried out in\n1787\nto find the precise distance between the Greenwich observatory in England and the Paris observatory, were part of an international project. The Government appointed MÃ©chain as a commissioner, along with\nLegendre\nand\nDominique Cassini\n, to triangulate the French side. The English part would be surveyed using\nRamsden\n's theodolite while the French proposed using\nBorda\n's repeating circle.\n[\nSee\nBorda\n's biography for a description of the repeating circle.\n]\nDominique Cassini\n, with MÃ©chain as his assistant, made the measurements with\nBorda\n's repeating circle on the French side. Initially MÃ©chain used older surveying equipment to check\nDominique Cassini\n's measurements with the repeating circle, but later in the project he took over measurements with the repeating circle. He soon gained a reputation as the most careful of observers.\nA picture of the Borda repeating circle is at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nMÃ©chain's work on comets became of major importance in\n1781\nwhen he discovered two comets in the same year. As with all his comet discoveries, and with many comets discovered by others, he calculated their orbits. In fact it was his work in calculating the orbits of two comets from observations which had been made in\n1532\nand\n1661\nthat led to his election to the\nAcadÃ©mie des Sciences\n. MÃ©chain's memoir on these comets was presented to the Academy for the Grand Prix of\n1782\nand in it he showed, unexpectedly, that they were not two appearances of the same comet but indeed different comets. His memoir won the prize which in turn was the main reason for his election to the Academy. He continued to discover comets, and while searching for them, he discovered\n29\nnebulae which would be added to Messier's catalogue.\nIn\n1785\nMÃ©chain was asked if he would take over the editorship of the astronomical almanac\nConnaissance des temps\n. This he did and produced seven volumes up to\n1794\nwhen\nLalande\n, who had been the editor earlier, took over of a second time. The Commission of Weights and Measures, which had as its members\nCondorcet\n, Lavoisier,\nLaplace\nand\nLegendre\n, was set up by the\nAcadÃ©mie des Sciences\nin\n1790\nto bring in a uniform system of measurement. It reported to the National Assembly on the\n19\nMarch\n1791\nwith the proposal that one metre should be one ten millionth of the distance from the North Pole to the equator. It was decided to measure, using the method of triangulation with sightings made with the\nBorda\nrepeating circle, that part of the meridian between Dunkerque and Barcelona. This was divided into two unequal parts, Dunkerque to Rodez and Rodez to Barcelona. The northern part was much the longer since it had been accurately measured by\nCassini de Thury\nin\n1740\n.\nDelambre\nwas given charge of the Dunkerque to Rodez sector and MÃ©chain the Rodez to Barcelona sector much of which had not been previously surveyed.\nMÃ©chain left Paris on\n28\nJune\n1792\nand travelled to Barcelona to begin his survey. During the summer he set up stations in Catalonia to act as triangulation points and in the autumn he used the\nBorda\nrepeating circle to take accurate sightings of these stations. He then went to Barcelona for the winter months to take accurate measurements of its latitude. The Spanish authorities were cooperative and he was allowed to use the castle on the top of Mont-Jouy overlooking the city. He made a large number of observations of the stars over a period of three months to give a precise result for the latitude. MÃ©chain was fanatical about accuracy and, as we shall soon see, these measurements would cause him anguish for the rest of his life.\nWhen war broke out between France and Spain in March\n1793\n, MÃ©chain had to leave Mont-Jouy which was required for military purposes. In May of that year he was nearly killed when being shown a new hydraulic pumping station by one of his friends. In saving his friend, who had become tangled in the machinery, he was struck by a lever and suffered several broken bones. It was months before he fully regained the use of his right arm but, in September, once he had recovered sufficiently, he began triangulating the peaks of the PyrÃ©nÃ©es. Back in Barcelona for the winter he could not return to Mont-Jouy because of the war but made latitude measurements from the inn he was living in. By March of\n1794\nMÃ©chain had discovered that the latitude measurements he had taken from the inn did not agree with those from Mont-Jouy, yet he could not return to the castle to take further measurements. He did not inform anyone of the error.\nAt this stage he took the advice of his Spanish friends and went to Italy. He lived for a year in Genoa and while there he learnt of the cancellation of the meridian project. However in April\n1795\nthe project was restarted and MÃ©chain was told to return to Paris. He refused, fearing for his life since he knew that other scientists had gone to the guillotine, and instead sailed to Marseille. He remained there until late August when he went to Perpignan to resume his measurements. However he was now reluctant to proceed, was hampered by bad weather, continued to refuse to return to Paris to meet with\nDelambre\nwho was triangulating the northern sector, and achieved almost nothing for two years. Although\nDelambre\nsent him all the data that he was collecting, MÃ©chain refused to let anyone see his data. He feared that his error would be discovered if he returned to Paris and his data was examined. He began to alter his data, not so as the average was changed, but just so that the deviation from the average was reduced.\nThe agony that MÃ©chain suffered was because he had extremely high standards and he believed that the\nBorda\nrepeating circle could attain essentially any desired accuracy. What he did not understand was the statistics underlying the theory of error, something which of course had not been developed at this time. Taking more and more measurements would only lead to greater accuracy if the errors were random. Any bias in the instrument would produce a systematic error which would be present in all observations. He blamed himself for discrepancies which were in no way his fault.\nIn January\n1798\nthe\nAcadÃ©mie des Sciences\nset up an international conference to take place in September of that year to give an international standing to the new value of the metre which the\nDelambre\n-MÃ©chain survey had still to finalise. Yet by May MÃ©chain still was making no progress and\nDelambre\nand\nBorda\narranged for MÃ©chain's wife to travel from Paris to join her husband and ensure that he finish his task. When MÃ©chain met his wife in Rodez in July it was the first time they had seen each other for six years. She returned to Paris unable to convince MÃ©chain to complete his task.\nDelambre\nwent to help MÃ©chain who by this time had suffered a nervous breakdown. They completed the triangulations by November\n1798\n. MÃ©chain wanted to return to Barcelona to take further readings but he was persuaded to return to Paris\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nFaced with the choice of returning to Paris and the warm welcome of his colleagues, or remaining forever an expatriate, MÃ©chain reluctantly came back to Paris. There he was less than cooperative in presenting his observations to the commissioners charged with setting up the decimal metric system.\nIt may have been the promise that he would be made director of the Paris observatory which tempted MÃ©chain back to Paris. Certainly he was elected to this position shortly after his return and made temporary director of the Bureau de Longitudes. This put him in a good position to get a project approved to extend the measurement of the meridian line to the Balearic Islands. He argued that accuracy would be improved by measuring the longer line, but his real reason was that the extension would make the latitude measurements at Barcelona which so tormented him, unnecessary. In his request to Napoleon for permission, however, he stressed the strategic position of the Balearic Islands, and how his mission could improve French relations with Spain. Napoleon, after taking advice from\nDelambre\nand\nLaplace\n, approved the mission.\nMÃ©chain left Paris on\n26\nApril\n1803\nfor Spain. When he arrived in Barcelona, however, he discovered that the Spanish were opposed to his mission and he was offered no passport to the Balearic Islands. He spent time measuring triangles on the Spanish coast down to Montsia, then an epidemic of yellow fever struck. Another problem was that he failed to be able to see Ibiza from Montsia and one had to be able to see his Montsia station from there to complete his triangles. In January\n1804\nhe managed to get a passport and a ship to take him to Ibiza. Despite what the Spanish had told him he could not see his Montsia station and he wrote to\nDelambre\n(\nsee for example\n[\n2\n]\n)\n:-\nHell and all the plagues it spews upon the earth - storms, wars, pestilence and dark intrigues - have all been unleashed against me. What demon still awaits me? But vain exhortation will solve nothing, nor complete my task.\nOn the advice of\nDelambre\nhe returned to the Spanish coast to triangulate down to Valencia. However, he developed a fever and died from malaria about\n10\ndays later.\nDelambre\nwrote a fine eulogy for MÃ©chain describing his meridian measurements\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nNever did he consider these observations, the most exact ever achieved in this domain and conducted with unsurpassed certainty and precision, never did he consider them sufficiently perfected ...\nHowever, when he worked on MÃ©chain's data for his\nBase du systÃ¨me mÃ©trique\nhe discovered that MÃ©chain had changed his readings to make them appear more precise than they were. We explained above how a lack of understanding of the theory of errors in MÃ©chain's time led him to down this path since he blamed himself for the discrepancies.\nDelambre\ndid not want confidence in the metric system destroyed and a public announcement that MÃ©chain had altered his data might well have had this result. He was too honest a scientist to pretend discrepancies were not there, so he treated MÃ©chain's results as important scientific discoveries rather than as errors. The more sensitive personal letters and the evidence that MÃ©chain had fiddled the results and lied to his colleagues were sealed in the archives of the Paris observatory. We should make it clear however that\nDelambre\nwanted to preserve MÃ©chain's high reputation which, in\nDelambre\n's words\n[\n2\n]\n:-\n...\n[\nhe\n]\nrightly enjoyed for the care he put into all his observations and calculations."
