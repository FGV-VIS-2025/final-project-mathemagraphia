  "biografia": "Ernest de JonquiÃ¨res\nentered the Ãcole Navale at Brest in\n1835\n. After graduating from the school he spent\n36\nyears in the French navy. He reached positions of high rank, being made a lieutenant in\n1841\nand serving on the Admiralty Council from\n1848\nto\n1850\n. In\n1846\nChasles\nhad been appointed to a chair of higher geometry at the Sorbonne which had been specially created for him. De JonquiÃ¨res' appointment to the Admiralty Council meant that he was living in Paris during this period and he was already interested in mathematical research after reading the works of\nPoncelet\nand\nChasles\n. In Paris de JonquiÃ¨res could take full advantage of the mathematical environment\n[\n5\n]\n:-\n... his geometric creative faculty developed in an astonishing manner, and it did not take him long to become\nChasles\n' most eminent pupil and the most gifted commentator on his works.\nThis was the period when\nChasles\nwas collecting material for his\nTraitÃ© de gÃ©omÃ©trie\nâ\n(\nTreatise on geometry\n)\n(1852)\nin which he discusses cross ratio, pencils and involutions - all notions which he introduced. De JonquiÃ¨res thrived in this association with\nChasles\nproving results which\nChasles\nconjectured and solving problems which he put forward.\nAfter the period in Paris, de JonquiÃ¨res visited several countries as part of his naval duties. During\n1860\n-\n61\nhe made lengthy sea voyages and this provided him with much time free from distractions during which he could work out many of the mathematical ideas which he was developing. It also put him in an excellent position to enter an essay for the Grand Prix of the\nAcademy of Sciences\nfor\n1862\nwhich had the topic:-\nSummarise, discuss and improve in some important point the known results on the theory of plane curves of the fourth order.\nThe committee which evaluated the entries decided to split the prize, but de JonquiÃ¨res' entry was considered the best and he received two-thirds of the prize.\nIn\n1865\nde JonquiÃ¨res was promoted to captain of a naval vessel. He was sent to Indo-China where his mission was to establish the first agricultural and industrial exposition at Saigon. Saigon had been captured by the French in\n1859\n, and in\n1862\nit had been ceded to France by the Vietnamese emperor Tu Duc after negotiations with the French commander Louis-Adolphe Bonard:-\nAs the capital of Cochinchina, Saigon was transformed into a major port city and a metropolitan centre of beautiful villas, imposing public buildings, and well-paved, tree-lined boulevards.\nDe JonquiÃ¨res played an important role in the transformation of the city by the French.\nAfter his return he was on the Naval Works Council, then on\n17\nDecember\n1874\nhe was appointed as Rear Admiral, becoming Vice-Admiral on\n1\nOctober\n1879\n. He retired in\n1885\nhaving been elected an academician by the Institute of France on\n24\nMarch\n1884\n.\nAfter his introduction to advanced mathematics by\nChasles\nit is not surprising that his main interests were geometry throughout his life. He made many contributions many of them extending the work of\nPoncelet\nand\nChasles\n. An early work, the treatise\nMÃ©langes de gÃ©omÃ©trie pure\nâ\n(\nDiversions in  pure geometry\n)\n(1856)\ncontains: an amplifications of Chasles' ideas on the geometric properties of an infinitely small movement of a free body in space; a commentary on Chasles' work on conic sections; the principle of homographic correspondence; and constructions relating to curves of the third order. In a final section de JonquiÃ¨res presented a French translation of Maclaurin's work on curves.\nIn\n1859\nde JonquiÃ¨res introduced the birational transformation, later studied by\nCremona\n, which is\nx\nâ¦\nx\n,\ny\nâ¦\na\n(\nx\n)\n.\ny\n+\nb\n(\nx\n)\nc\n(\nx\n)\n.\ny\n+\nd\n(\nx\n)\nx \\mapsto  x, y \\mapsto  \\Large\\frac{a(x).y+b(x)}{c(x).y+d(x)}\\normalsize\nx\nâ¦\nx\n,\ny\nâ¦\nc\n(\nx\n)\n.\ny\n+\nd\n(\nx\n)\na\n(\nx\n)\n.\ny\n+\nb\n(\nx\n)\nâ\nwhere\na\n(\nx\n)\n.\nd\n(\nx\n)\nâ\nb\n(\nx\n)\n.\nc\n(\nx\n)\nâ\n0\na(x).d(x) - b(x).c(x) â  0\na\n(\nx\n)\n.\nd\n(\nx\n)\nâ\nb\n(\nx\n)\n.\nc\n(\nx\n)\nî\nâ\n=\n0\n. This appears in a memoir presented to the Institute of France at a meeting on\n10\nOctober and also at a meeting on\n23\nJanuary in the following year. In fact de JonquiÃ¨res' paper was not published until\n1885\nalthough a summary of it was published in\n1864\n.\nHe also studied curve beams, algebraic curves and surfaces, linking his work with that of\nSalmon\n,\nCayley\nand\nCremona\n. In addition de JonquiÃ¨res discovered results in the area of\nSchubert\n's\nAbzÃ¤hlende Geometrie\nâ\n(\nEnumerative geometry\n)\n. He also worked on algebra, in particular the theory of equations, and, in the latter part of his life, on the theory of numbers where he examined\nDiophantine equations\nand the distribution of primes. Another topic which he studied after retiring from the navy was the theory of polyhedra. In this area he made historical investigations, discovering that\nDescartes\nhad come up with the famous formula\nF\n+\nV\n=\nE\n+\n2\nF + V = E + 2\nF\n+\nV\n=\nE\n+\n2\nlong before\nEuler\n.\nL Novy and J Folta, writing in\n[\n1\n]\n, state that:-\n... his results form a series of detailed supplements to the work of others and reflect JonquiÃ¨res's inventiveness in calculating rather than a more profound contribution to the advancement of the field.\nIn\n[\n5\n]\nLoria\nwrites about de JonquiÃ¨res in poetic terms linking his mathematical approach to his naval life:-\n... de JonquiÃ¨res has a right to a distinguished place among the geometers of second rank who flourished in France in the latter half of the nineteenth century. It he did not rate higher, it was because his occupation as a seaman did not permit him to; we can believe this, for his official duties reflected visibly on his mathematical production. In fact, the discontinuities in his researches in pure science produced those gaps in his culture, that inadequate knowledge of the literature of his time, which stand out in a great number of his works. But\n(\nleaving aside his research in the realm of number in which he followed known and sure paths\n)\nthe daily battle with the waves of the ocean appears to have endowed him with an admirable courage and valuable initiative; we see him approach with a smile questions capable of frightening consummate mathematicians, and calmly employ dangerous methods, the legitimacy of which is still under discussion. One might say that if, as a soldier, de JonquiÃ¨res belonged to the regular army, as a geometer he presented all the character of a guerrilla, despising antiquated routine and rising to attack by the most dangerous paths. Other fearful geometers, preferring the classical roads, did not fail to proclaim the wounds that befell him, which we, as impartial historians, have not hidden; but we can answer that wounds are part of heroes, and that only cowards who never go into battle escape them.\nThe work\n[\n2\n]\nin the list of references is an autobiography."
