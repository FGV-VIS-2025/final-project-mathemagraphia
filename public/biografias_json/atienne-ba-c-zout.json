  "biografia": "Ãtienne BÃ©zout\n's father was Pierre BÃ©zout who was a magistrate in the town of Nemours. One might have expected Ãtienne to follow the same career, for his grandfather had also been a magistrate in Nemours. Ãtienne's mother was HÃ©lÃ¨ne-Jeanne Filz.\nAs we have already indicated the family tradition almost demanded that Ãtienne follow in his father and grandfather's footsteps. However the remarkable mathematics of\nLeonard Euler\nproved stronger than his parents wishes, for once BÃ©zout had read\nEuler\n's works he wished to devote himself to mathematics. In\n1756\nhe published a memoir\nDynamique\n. In the following year he published\nQuantitÃ©s diffÃ©rentielles\nand in\n1758\nRectification des courbes\n. These latter two papers were investigations of integration.\nIn\n1758\nBÃ©zout was appointed an adjoint in mechanics of the\nAcadÃ©mie des Sciences\nand, in the same year, as royal censor. He was appointed examiner of the Gardes de la Marine in\n1763\n, the post being offered to him by the Duke of Choiseul. One important task that he was given in this role was to compose a textbook specially designed for teaching mathematics to the students.\nBÃ©zout is famed for the texbooks which came out of this assignment. The first was\nCours de mathÃ©matiques Ã  l'usage des Gardes du Pavillon et de la Marine\nâ\n(\nMathematics for the use of 'Pavillon' and Marine Guards\n)\n, a four volume work which appeared in\n1764\n-\n67\n.\nIn\n1768\nCamus\n, who was the examiner for the artillery, died. BÃ©zout was appointed to succeed him becoming examiner of the Corps d'Artillerie. He began work on another mathematics textbook and as a result he produced\nCours complet de mathÃ©matiques Ã  l'usage de la marine et de l'artillerie\nâ\n(\nComplete Mathematics for the use of the navy and artillery\n)\n, a six volume work which appeared between\n1770\nand\n1782\n. This was a very successful textbook and for many years it was the book which students hoping to enter the Ãcole Polytechnique studied. Grabiner writes in\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nThe experience of teaching non-mathematicians shaped the style of the works: BÃ©zout treated geometry before algebra, observing that beginners were not yet familiar enough with mathematical reasoning to understand the force of algebraic demonstrations, although they did appreciate proofs in geometry. He eschewed the frightening terms \"axiom\", \"theorem\", \"scholium\", and tried to avoid arguments that were too close and detailed.\nAs might be expected given this approach aimong at the readership for whom BÃ©zout intended his texts, his books came in for a certain amount of criticism for lacking rigour. However, despite this they were books which could be understood by those who needed to use mathematics and as a result were very popular and widely used. Their use spread beyond France for they were translated into English and used in North America. In particular Harvard University adopted them as calculus textbooks.\nReturning to give more information about BÃ©zout's career, we should note that he was promoted to associÃ© in mechanics at the\nAcadÃ©mie des Sciences\nin\n1768\nand then further promoted to pensionnaire in\n1770\n.\nAs we have indicated BÃ©zout is famed for being a writer of textbooks but he is famed also for his work on algebra, in particular on equations. He was much occupied with his teaching duties after his\n1763\nappointments and he took these very seriously indeed. As a consequence he could devote relatively little time to research and he made a conscience decision to restrict the range of his work so that he could produce worthwhile results in a narrow order.\nThe way BÃ©zout went about his research is interesting since still today it is a good approach for obtaining results. He attacked quite general problems, but since an attack was usually beyond what could be achieved with the mathematical knowledge then available, he attacked special cases of the general problems which he could solve. This approach often leads slowly to more and more understanding of the general case which may eventually become soluble. BÃ©zout had a name for this approach to mathematics, namely the \"method of simplifying assumptions\".\nHis first paper on the theory of equations\nSur plusieurs classes d'Ã©quations de tous les degrÃ©s qui admettent une solution algÃ©brique\nâ\n(\nOn several classes of equations of all degrees which admit an algebraic solution\n)\nexamined how a single equation in a single unknown could be attacked by writing it as two equations in two unknowns. He wrote in this paper:-\nIt is known that a determinate equation can always be viewed as the result of two equations in two unknowns, when one of the unknowns is eliminated.\nOf course on the face of it this does not help solve the equation but BÃ©zout made the simplifying assumption that one of the two equations was of a particularly simple form. For example he considered the case when one of the two equations had only two terms, the term of degree\nn\nn\nn\nand a constant term. Already this paper had introduced the topic to which BÃ©zout would make his most important contributions, namely methods of elimination to produce from a set of simultaneous equations, a single resultant equation in one of the unknowns.\nHe also did important work on the use of\ndeterminants\nin solving equations. This appears in a paper\nSur le degrÃ© des Ã©quations rÃ©sultantes de l'Ã©vanouissement des inconnues\nâ\n(\nThe degree of equations resulting from disappearing unknowns\n)\nwhich he published in\n1764\n. As a result of the ideas in this paper for solving systems of simultaneous equations,\nSylvester\n, in\n1853\n, called the determinant of the matrix of coefficients of the equations the BÃ©zoutiant.\nThese and further papers published by BÃ©zout in the theory of equations were gathered together in\nThÃ©orie gÃ©nÃ©rale des Ã©quations algÃ©braiques\nâ\n(\nGeneral theory of algebraic equations\n)\nwhich was published in\n1779\n. This work includes a result known as BÃ©zout's theorem:-\nThe degree of the final equation resulting from any number of complete equations in the same number of unknowns, and of any degrees, is equal to the product of the degrees of the equations.\nBy a complete equation BÃ©zout meant one defined by a polynomial which contains terms of all possible products of the unknowns whose degree does not exceed that of the polynomial. One has to understand the problems that faced BÃ©zout for he did not have our simple suffix notation to denote the unknowns by\nx\n1\n,\nx\n2\n,\nx\n3\n,\n.\n.\n.\nx_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}, ...\nx\n1\nâ\n,\nx\n2\nâ\n,\nx\n3\nâ\n,\n.\n.\n.\nnor could he even label his equations with a suffix notation. Despite this BÃ©zout, who was prepared to enter long and difficult algebraic manipulations, proved his theorem with just a little hand waving over an inductive argument.\nIn this work BÃ©zout also gave the first satisfactory proof of a result of\nMaclaurin\non the intersection of two algebraic curves.\nGrabiner\n[\n1\n]\ntells us that:-\n[\nBÃ©zout\n]\nmarried early and happily; although he was reserved and somewhat sombre in society, those who knew him spoke of his great kindness and warm heart. By\n[1763]\nBÃ©zout had become a father ...\nAfter his death in\n1783\na statue was erected in Nemours, the town of his birth, to commemorate his great achievements."
