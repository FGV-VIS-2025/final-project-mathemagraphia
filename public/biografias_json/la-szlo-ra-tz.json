  "biografia": "LÃ¡szlo RÃ¡tz\n's parents were Ãgost RÃ¡tz\n(1827\n-\n1882)\n, who was an ironmonger, and Emma TÃ¶pler\n(1831\n-\n1900)\n. Ãgost and Emma had six children: Emma Carolina RÃ¡tz\n(1852\n-\n1879)\n; Ãgost Ede RÃ¡tz\n(1854\n-\n1892)\n; OttÃ³ RÃ¡tz\n(1857\n-\n1914)\n; KÃ¡roly RÃ¡tz\n(1859\n-\n1907)\n; LÃ¡szlo RÃ¡tz\n(\nthe subject of this biography\n)\n; and Lujza RÃ¡tz\n(1869\n-\n1945)\n. LÃ¡szlo RÃ¡tz was given the name Ladislaus Wilhelm RÃ¡tz when he was born, since Sopron belonged to a German speaking area, but he chose to use the Hungarian version of his name. Both RÃ¡tz's primary and secondary schooling was in Sopron. His secondary education was at the Royal Hungarian State School which today is called the SzÃ©chenyi IstvÃ¡n\nGymnasium\n. The director of the school at this time was Leo Salamin\n(1832\n-\n1902)\nwho, for five years, taught RÃ¡tz the French language. RÃ¡tz studied at this school until\n1880\nwhen he moved to the Sopron Lutheran Lyceum for the final two years of his secondary education.\nAt the Lyceum, in the first of his two years, he was taught history by SÃ¡muel FehÃ©r, Hungarian language by Imre GÃ³bi, German and Latin by J P KirÃ¡ly, logic by SÃ¡ndor Malatides, German by GusztÃ¡v PoszvÃ©k, religion by SÃ¡ndor PoszvÃ©k, mathematics and physics by JÃ¡nos Renner, and Greek by KÃ¡roly Thiering. JÃ¡nos Renner had a love and enthusiasm for mathematics and physics that he transmitted to his pupils. He was a strict teacher maintaining military discipline in his classes and the class had to sit in absolute silence waiting for him to arrive. However, he was very fair and respected by his pupils although they found him rather frightening. He gave all his students, and certainly he gave RÃ¡tz, an excellent grounding to begin university studies. In the second of his two years he was again taught by Imre GÃ³bi, J P KirÃ¡ly, GusztÃ¡v PoszvÃ©k, SÃ¡ndor PoszvÃ©k, JÃ¡nos Renner, and KÃ¡roly Thiering. However, he had two new teachers, namely MiklÃ³s GombÃ³cz who taught him psychology and history, and MÃ¡tyÃ¡s MÃ¼llner who taught him Latin.\nRÃ¡tz entered the Budapest University of Arts and Sciences\n(\ntoday named\nEÃ¶tvÃ¶s LorÃ¡nd\nUniversity\n)\nin\n1883\nand he studied there until\n1887\n. From\n4\nOctober\n1887\nto\n7\nAugust\n1888\nhe studied philosophy at the University of Berlin, before going to Strassburg where he studied science and natural history for a year starting the course on\n31\nOctober\n1888\n. He returned to Budapest in September\n1889\nand spent a year as a student teacher at the Gymnasium which was attached to the University of Arts and Sciences. The Budapest University of Arts and Sciences had been in the forefront of teacher training in Europe having founded the State Teacher Training Institution\n(\ntoday called the Faculty of Primary and Pre-School Education\n)\nin\n1869\nand, three years later, the first Teacher Training School\n(\ntoday called the ELTE Trefort Ãgoston Teacher Training School\n)\n.\nOn\n28\nNovember\n1890\n, RÃ¡tz received a university diploma in mathematics and physics, three months after he had taken up his appointment as a substitute teacher at the Budapest Fasor Lutheran Gymnasium on\n1\nSeptember. This Gymnasium had been founded in\n1823\n. It was situated in what is today known as DeÃ¡k Square but, long before RÃ¡tz began teaching there, it had moved in\n1864\nto a location in SÃ¼tÃ¶ Street. Although his initial appointment had only been a temporary one, after two years it was made permanent. He remained at the school for the rest of his career, retiring in\n1925\n.\nThe Fasor Lutheran Gymnasium was a highly successful school and it took in a large number of pupils. It became too large for its premises on SÃ¼tÃ¶ Street and attempts were made to obtain funding to move to a new building. Funding was obtained from the Hungarian State and sponsorship was obtained from DÃ¡niel Glosius and his wife Sarolta Artner. A plaque now honours their help in providing new buildings. In\n1904\na new building was opened at VÃ¡rosliget Fasor which provided greater facilities for the school. RÃ¡tz was made director of the Fasor Lutheran Gymnasium in\n1909\nand continued in this capacity for five years. It was during these years that he began teaching some of his most famous pupils. In the\n1910\ns,\nJohn von Neuman\n,\nJenÃ³ Wigner\nand the physicist LeÃ³ SzilÃ¡rd\n(1898\n-\n1964)\nwere taught at the Budapest Fasor Lutheran Gymnasium. The school provided a solid education for them in mathematics, literature, classics and religion. It did provide science teaching, but there was less emphasis on this than on other subjects. All were taught mathematics by RÃ¡tz.\nWigner\nspoke about RÃ¡tz after receiving the Nobel prize\n(\nsee\n[\n4\n]\nand also\n[\n3\n]\n)\n:-\n... there were many superb teachers at the Lutheran gymnasium. But the greatest was my mathematics teacher LÃ¡szlÃ³ RÃ¡tz. RÃ¡tz was known not only throughout our gymnasium but also by the church and government hierarchy and among many of the teachers in the country schools. I still keep a photograph of RÃ¡tz in my workroom because he had every quality of a miraculous teacher: He loved teaching. He knew the subject and how to kindle interest in it. He imparted the very deepest understanding. Many gymnasium teachers had great skill, but no one could evoke the beauty of the subject like RÃ¡tz. RÃ¡tz cared deeply about mathematics as a discipline. At the retirement of Imre Gobi, the gymnasium director, the staff named RÃ¡tz as his successor. That gave RÃ¡tz a formal title and likely a higher salary. Most men would have said, 'Thank you kindly for the promotion. This is very fine.' But RÃ¡tz worried that his new duties would hurt his teaching. He knew how much energy is needed to evoke the deepest beauties of mathematics. And after five years of distinguished service as director, RÃ¡tz quietly resigned as director and became just a teacher again. He took special care to find his better students and to inspire them. RÃ¡tz felt so privileged to tutor a phenomenon like\nNeumann Jancsi\nthat he refused any money for it. He took special care to find his better students and to inspire them. RÃ¡tz felt so privileged to tutor a phenomenon like\nNeumann Jancsi\nthat he refused any money for it. You might say, 'Well,\nvon Neumann\nwas one of the great mathematicians of our century. Of course he deserved private classes as a boy.' But look at this from the teacher's point of view. He appeared to be a genius. But, of course, not yet famous at all. His brain wasn't that of an adult. He had never published. He was just a startling\n10\n-year-old boy, working next to\n20\nother bright\n10\n-year-olds. Who could know that this precocious\n10\n-year-old would someday become a great mathematician? Somehow RÃ¡tz knew. And he discovered it very quickly. RÃ¡tz was just as nice to me and nearly as devoted as he was to\nNeumann\n. RÃ¡tz was the only gymnasium teacher to invite me into his home. There were no private lessons. But RÃ¡tz lent me many well-chosen books, which I read thoroughly and made sure to return in good condition. RÃ¡tz also compiled for his students a book of common sense mathematical problems. I solved a few of them, but most I found fantastically hard. Often in the years since, when I have been in no mood for work, I have taken RÃ¡tz's little book from the self and studied those common sense problems.\nSÃ¡ndor Mikola wrote an appreciation of RÃ¡tz when he retired and this appeared in\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nEven more profound than that of the reform in mathematics teaching was the impact which LÃ¡szlÃ³ RÃ¡tz's work in connection with the Journal of Secondary-School Mathematics had on the teaching of mathematics in our country. He edited the journal for twenty years, and did so with the utmost selflessness, receiving no support from the state or any other source\n(\nnot that he asked for it\n)\nand, indeed, contributing substantial amounts of his own money to ensure the journal's publication. With the greatest of care he solicited for publication in the modest periodical articles and problems which would sow the seeds of mathematical thought in the pupils. With even greater care and conscientiousness he read through and evaluated solutions to the published problems sent in from all parts of the country. His acute perceptiveness consistently enabled him to recognise true abilities, I can deservedly boast on his part that those who excelled as mathematicians in college or university, with almost no exceptions, emerged from the modest ranks of his journal's readership.\nNot only did RÃ¡tz excel as a mathematics teacher but he was also active in his efforts to reform the teaching of mathematics throughout all Hungarian schools. He was a major player in a committee set up to propose reforms and his ideas inffluenced the teaching of mathematics in Hungary for many years. You can read about his work in reforming the teaching of mathematics in Hungary at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nIt was not just the recommendations of the committee that were influential, however, for the example he set at the Budapest Lutheran Gymnasium also had an strong influence on teaching in other schools. For example, Vogeli writes in\n[\n4\n]\n:-\nThe reputation of RÃ¡tz and the Fasor Street Gymnasium set the stage in Budapest for identifying particular schools that specialised in mathematics.\nIt was not only teaching in Budapest that was influenced by RÃ¡tz for, in session\n1907\n-\n08\n, the Budapest Lutheran Gymnasium sent materials used in the teaching of mathematics in the school to London, England, to form part of the cultural section of an exhibition there.\nAfter RÃ¡tz retired in\n1925\nhe was made an honorary director of the Lutheran Gymnasium. He died in the GrÃ¼nwald Sanatorium in Budapest after suffering a long and painful illness. His grave is in the Lutheran Cemetery in Budapest."
