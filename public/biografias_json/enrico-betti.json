  "biografia": "Enrico Betti\n's father, Matteo Betti, died when Enrico was very young and his mother, Francesca Dei, had to bring him up and educate him on her own. He had two sisters Luisa and Laura who both died at a young age. His mother Francesca had the income from two small houses in Pistoia and she supplemented this with work of her own to support the education of her son. Enrico's schooling was at the Forteguerri school in Pistoia where he had a classical education. This ancient school had been founded in\n1473\nby Cardinal NiccolÃ² Forteguerri to allow poor students to get access to higher education.\nBetti studied mathematics and physics at the University of Pisa, winning a place as a student in one of the grand-ducal colleges where he supported himself by private tutoring. At the university he was taught by Ottaviano Fabrizio Mossotti\n(1791\n-\n1863)\nand Carlo Matteucci\n(1811\n-\n1868)\n. Mossotti had been exiled from Italy for his liberal views and, after a while in Switzerland and then England, he had been professor of experimental physics at the University of Buenos Aires before returning to Italy in\n1835\n. He taught at the University of Pisa from\n1840\nwhere he gave courses on mathematical physics, celestial mechanics and geodesy which Betti attended. Betti learnt about experimental physics from Matteucci who had studied in Paris under\nFranÃ§ois Arago\n. It was\nArago\nwho had recommended his appointment to Pisa in\n1840\n. We note that Matteucci was awarded the Copley Medal by the\nRoyal Society of London\nin\n1844\n. Betti graduated with a laurea in pure and applied mathematics in\n1846\nhaving been advised by the professor of algebra Giuseppe Doveri\n(1792\n-\n1857)\n. Doveri's early education had been in Florence and he had obtained a degree in mathematics from the University of Pisa.\nFollowing the award of his degree, Betti was appointed as an assistant at the University of Pisa. He worked at the university at a time when political and military events in Italy were intensifying as the country came nearer to unification. There were not only the internal politics of unification but there were problems with Austria and France, both countries having their own agendas. Mossotti strongly supported the fight for independence and led a Tuscany University Battalion in an attempt to achieve this aim. Betti joined this battalion led by Mossotti and, with the rank of corporal, he fought in the battle of Curtatone and Montanara on\n29\nMay\n1848\n. This battle, part of the War of Independence of Italy, was fought between Austrian troops who had been stationed in the fortified town of Mantua, and Tuscan soldiers who were supported by young volunteers like those of the Tuscany University Battalion. These young men, like Betti, had no experience of battle but were filled with enthusiasm for their cause and proved to be excellent fighters. Betti and others had been promoted to officers merely for the occasion. They spent fifteen days carrying out military training before the battle took place. The odds were heavily in the favour of the Austrian troops when they left Mantua to attack the Tuscans for there were\n20\n,\n000\nof them against\n7\n,\n000\nTuscans. The Tuscany University Battalion waited for orders from the Tuscan army but, when no orders arrived and they could hear the sounds of battle about\n2\nkm away, they charged into the battle and fought with great bravery beside the regular Tuscan soldiers. Eventually the Tuscans were forced to retreat with heavy losses but the Austrians had themselves received even greater losses and did not advance. Betti was extremely fortunate to survive the battle which proved to be a vital one in a campaign which would eventually be successful. After this battle, Betti returned to the University of Pisa.\nAfter working as an assistant at the University of Pisa, Betti returned to his home town of Pistoia where he became a teacher of mathematics at the Forteguerri secondary school in the town in\n1849\n. This, of course, was the school at which Betti had studied. He took on these teaching positions not because he wanted to spend his life as a school teacher but rather because he had to earn his living while he undertook research which, he hoped, would gain him a university appointment. Capecchi writes in\n[\n14\n]\n:-\nThe relative cultural insulation determined the original character of his research on the solution by radicals of algebraic equations. Though\nGalois\n' works originated in the\n1820\ns, still in the second half of the nineteenth century they were found hard to be understood even in France.\nIn\n1854\nhe moved to Florence where again he taught in a secondary school. During these years when Betti was a secondary school teacher, he was undertaking research with Mossotti as his advisor. In\n[\n21\n]\nthe extant correspondence between Betti and Mossotti between\n1847\nand\n1857\nis published. Mossotti gives continual research advice to his pupil but it is clear from the correspondence that the relation between the two is not simply that of teacher and pupil but the two are also friends. Betti explains his ideas about research to Mossotti, in particular he was working to give satisfactory proofs of many propositions which\nGalois\nhad simply stated without giving any proof. In fact Betti became the first to publish observations and demonstrations on\nGalois\ntheory with his papers of\n1851\n-\n1852\n. These papers, published in the\nAnnali di Scienze fisiche e matematiche\n, are:\nSopra la risolubilitÃ  per radicali delle equazioni algebriche irriduttibili di grado primo\nâ\n(\nOn the solvability of irreducible algebraic equations of the first degree by radicals\n)\n(1851)\n;\nUn teorema sulle risolventi dell'equazioni risolubili per radicali\nâ\n(\nA theorem on solving equations solvable by radicals\n)\n(1851)\n; and\nSulla risoluzione dell'equazioni algebriche\nâ\n(\nOn the algebraic resolution of equations\n)\n(1852)\n. We should note, however, that these are not Betti's first publications for he had published the paper on mathematical physics\nSopra la determinazione analitica dell'efflusso dei liquidi per una piccolissima apertura\nâ\n(\nOn the analytical determination of the flow of fluids through a very small opening\n)\nin\n1850\n.\nBetti was appointed as professor of higher algebra at the University of Pisa in\n1857\n. In the following year he, along with\nFrancesco Brioschi\nand\nFelice Casorati\n, visited the leading mathematical centres of Europe. They visited GÃ¶ttingen, Berlin and Paris making many important mathematical contacts. In particular in GÃ¶ttingen Betti met and became friendly with\nRiemann\n. Back in Pisa in\n1859\nhe moved to the chair of analysis and higher geometry. He gave his inaugural professorial address in\n1860\nwhich was not published but details of it survive and are discussed in\n[\n11\n]\n. Mossotti, who held the chair of mathematical physics, died in\n1863\nand Betti was appointed to that chair in addition to the chair of analysis and higher geometry.\nWe have already explained Betti's involvement in the\n1858\n-\n59\nwar with Austria in which the French at first joined the Italians against the Austrians. However, by\n17\nMarch\n1861\n, the Kingdom of Italy was formally created. Rome and Venice were not part of Italy at this stage, however, and there continued high levels of political activity as the government structure was discussed. Betti served in the government of the new country when he became a member of Parliament in\n1862\n, representing Pistoia, continuing in this role until\n1867\n.\nIn an attempt to improve his health,\nRiemann\nmade an Italian visit in the autumn of\n1863\nand renewed his friendship with Betti. In a letter to his friend and colleague P Tardy, written from Florence on\n6\nOctober\n1863\n, Betti writes\n(\nsee\n[\n4\n]\n)\n:-\nI have newly talked with\nRiemann\nabout the connectivity of spaces, and have formed an accurate idea of the matter.\nOver quite a number of years Betti mixed political service with service for his university. He served a term as rector of the University of Pisa and he became director of its teachers' college, the Scuola Normale Superiore, in\n1864\nholding this post until his death. Under his leadership the Scuola Normale Superiore in Pisa became the leading Italian centre for mathematical research and mathematical education. The creation of the new Kingdom of Italy led to a renewed interest in mathematics and its teaching throughout the country and Betti played a major role in this. He had strong views on how mathematics should be taught in schools. He\n[\n1\n]\n:-\n... loved classical culture, and with\nBrioschi\nhe championed the return to the teaching of\nEuclid\nin secondary schools, for he regarded\nEuclid\n's work as a model of discipline and beauty.\nHe furthered these aims by collaborating with\nBrioschi\nin making a translation of\nEuclid\n's\nElements\n. Betti, without\nBrioschi\n's assistance, also translated another school text, namely\nJoseph Bertrand\n's\nAlgebra elementare\nâ\n(\nElementary algebra\n)\n. We have already noted that in\n1864\nBetti succeeded Mossotti when he was appointed to the chair of mathematical physics and he continued to hold this chair for the rest of his life. Carlo Matteucci, another of his teachers, had founded the journal\nNuovo Cimento\nin\n1844\nand, in\n1863\nBetti became its editor-in-chief. He published ten papers in this journal. In\n1871\nBetti founded the\nAnnali della Scuola Normale - Sezione della classe di scienze fisiche e matematiche\n, designed as a place where students could publish dissertations or\nhabilitation\ntheses. In\n1870\nhe moved from the chair of analysis and geometry to the chair of celestial mechanics. He also held this chair for the rest of his life.\nPolitical events continued to build the new country of Italy, with the Treaty of Vienna bringing Venice into the Italian Kingdom in\n1866\n. Rome was attacked by Italian troops the following year but France defended the city with its troops against the attack. There was widespread unrest in Italy due to dissatisfaction with the government and it was far from clear that the newly unified country would not split apart again. In\n1870\n, however, Italian troops captured Rome and it became the capital of the Kingdom of Italy. Betti continued to undertake political roles in the developing country. He served as an undersecretary of state for education for eighteen months from October\n1874\nto March\n1876\nbut he\n[\n1\n]\n:-\n... longed, however, for the academic life, solitary meditation, and discussion with close friends.\nHe served as a senator in the Italian Parliament in\n1884\nbut again he missed the academic life\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nHis principal aim, however, was always pure scientific research with a noble philosophical purpose.\nAs\nUlisse Dini\nnotes in\n[\n15\n]\n, Betti worked in many, very different, mathematical areas such as: the theory of algebraic equations; the theory of elliptic functions, algebraic functions of a complex variable, on spaces of many dimensions etc in analysis and on the applications of this to geometry; he published many works on mathematical physics and celestial mechanics, the theory of Newtonian forces, the theory of heat, the theory of electricity, magnetism, elasticity, capillary, hydrodynamics, the motion of systems of particles, and the extension of the principles of dynamics. However, he is particularly known for his contributions to algebra and topology. In his early work in the area of equations and algebra, as we have already seen, Betti extended and gave proofs relating to the algebraic concepts of\nGalois theory\n. These had been previously published without proofs and in this task Betti thus made an important contribution to the transition from classical to modern algebra. He published these important contributions in several works starting in\n1851\nand he was the first to give a proof that the\nGalois\ngroup is closed under multiplication. In\n1854\nBetti showed that the quintic equation could be solved in terms of integrals resulting in\nelliptic functions\n.\nHowever, we should not give the impression that Betti was the first to clarify all the difficulties in\nGalois\n' work. Although\nJordan\n, in his\nTraitÃ© des substitutions et des equations algebriques\nâ\n(\nTreatise on substitutions and on algebraic equations\n)\n(1870)\ncredits Betti with having filled the gaps in\nGalois\n' arguments and with having been the first to establish the sequence of\nGalois\n' theorems rigorously, the fact is that Betti's work contains substantial obscurities and errors. Mammone, in\n[\n19\n]\n, brings these points out very clearly, yet the paper\n[\n19\n]\nitself contains group theoretical errors as was pointed out by\nPeter Neumann\nwhen he reviewed it. Betti's errors appear to relate to normal subgroups of groups and he makes the false assumption that\n(\nin modern terms\n)\nevery extension splits.\nWe have already mentioned above that\nRiemann\nvisited Betti in Pisa in\n1863\n. Influenced by discussions with his friend\nRiemann\n, Betti was inspired to do important work in theoretical physics, in particular in potential theory and elasticity. He also published papers on the theory of functions, concentrating on elliptic functions. In fact this change of direction by Betti towards mathematical physics led to him substituting chairs at Pisa in\n1870\nas we remarked above.\nDini\n, who Betti had taught earlier, was appointed to fill his chair of analysis and higher geometry.\nLet us look in a little more detail at Betti's work on mathematical physics and in particular on elasticity. We give a description based on a somewhat modified version of that given in\n[\n14\n]\n:-\nBetti explored several aspects of mathematical physics; one of the most important was that regarding classical mechanics. In his early work he assumed a mechanistic approach, where force and not energy is the funding concept and virtual work the regulating law. In his work on capillarity, 'Memoria sopra la teoria della capillaritÃ '\nâ\n(\nMemoir on the theory of capillaries\n)\npublished in the 'Annali delle UniversitÃ  toscane\n(\nPisa\n)\n', Betti assumes bodies as formed by molecules which attract each other at short distance and repel at very short distance, and which do not practically interact at larger, but still very short distances. In his memoirs 'La teorica delle forze che agiscono secondo la legge di Newton e sue applicazioni all'elettrostatica' on Newtonian forces, Betti declared his Newtonian ideaology. Betti changed his attitude in his second memoir on capillarity, 'Teoria della capillaritÃ ' published in 'Nuovo Cimento', by giving the potential an energetic meaning and a founding role, on the basis of\nWilliam Thomson\n's studies. This change was definitive in the 'Teoria della elasticitÃ '\nâ\n(\nTheory of elasticity\n)\n(1874)\n, where no reference is made to internal forces, even avoiding the explicit mention of stress. When Betti wrote 'Teoria della elasticitÃ ', the theory of elasticity was already mature with known principles, though not completely shared. The exposition developed there, like modern handbooks, follows an axiomatic approach. Betti's principles are on the one hand the concepts of potential energy and strains, and on the other hand the principle of virtual work. Though the book is not particularly original for its theoretical aspects, it is important for the exposition of a general procedure to evaluate the displacements on a three-dimensional elastic continuum and for the solution of specific problems. Moreover, the manner in which the single arguments are presented became paradigmatic for most handbooks on the theory of elasticity.\nBetti published a memoir on the theory of elliptic functions\nLa teorica delle funzioni ellitiche\nâ\n(\nThe theory of elliptic functions\n)\n(1860)\n, containing results which were developed further by\nWeierstrass\nsome years later. He published an important paper on topology in\n1871\nwhich contained what we now call the \"Betti numbers\". This was his famous\nSopra gli spazi di un numero qualunque di dimensioni\nâ\n(\nOn spaces of any number of dimensions\n)\npublished in the\nAnnali di matematica pura ed applicata\n. The Betti numbers were so named by\nHenri PoincarÃ©\nwho was inspired to study topology through Betti's work on the subject. Another of his papers is\nSopra una estensione della terza legge di Keplero\nâ\n(\nOn an extension of Kepler's third law\n)\n(1888)\n. This paper, in the area of celestial mechanics, generalises\nLagrange\n's studies on the three-body problem.\nWe should also mention at this point the impressive list of students that studied with Betti including: Ernesto Padova\n(1845\n-\n1896)\n,\nEugenio Bertini\n,\nCesare ArzelÃ\n,\nGuido Ascoli\n,\nUlisse Dini\n,\nGregorio Ricci-Curbastro\n,\nVito Volterra\n, Valentino Cerruti\n(1850\n-\n1909)\n, Giuseppe Lauricella\n(1867\n-\n1913)\n, Carlo Somigliana\n(1860\n-\n1955)\n,\nSalvatore Pincherle\n,\nMario Pieri\n,\nFederigo Enriques\nand\nLuigi Bianchi\n.\nFollowing his appointment to the chair at Pisa in\n1857\nhe gave lectures on a wide range of different mathematical topics in each academic year up to the academic year\n1890\n-\n91\n. An enthusiastic and clear lecturer, he was greatly loved by his students. By November\n1890\n, however, he was already struggling to undertake his teaching commitments as he slowly became paralysed. This paralysis gradually became more severe making it increasingly difficult for him to continue to work at all. However, his death in his villa at Soiana came unexpectedly. Although he died in the middle of the summer vacation when most of the professors were absent from the university, nevertheless he was given a solemn funeral with many honours. It was attended by many of his colleagues and former pupils as well as many citizens of Pisa. He was buried in the Camposanto monumentale of Pisa.\nBetti received many honours including election to the\nAccademia dei Lincei\nin Rome\n(1851)\n, the\nNational Academy of Sciences of Italy\n(\nthe \"Academy of Forty\"\n)\n(1860)\n, the Academy of Sciences, Letters and Arts of Modena\n(1860)\n, the Royal Society of Naples\n(1863)\n, the Lombard Institute of Science and Letters in Milan\n(1864)\n, the\nAcademy of Sciences of Turin\n(1864)\nas well as the\nBerlin Academy of Sciences\n, the\nGÃ¶ttingen Academy of Sciences\n, the\nRoyal Society of London\nand the\nRoyal Swedish Academy of Sciences\nin Stockholm. In\n[\n10\n]\nBottazzini briefly describes the contents of twelve boxes in the library of the Scuola Normale Superiore in Pisa that contain Betti's unpublished notes and letters. There does not appear to be any further research published on the contents of these papers."
