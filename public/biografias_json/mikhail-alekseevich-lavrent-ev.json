  "biografia": "Let us first note the various transliterations of\nMikhail Alekseevich Lavrent'ev\n's name. These are most commonly Lavrent'ev, Lavrentev, Lavrentieff, Lavrentiev, Lavrentyev or Lavrentjev. His father, Aleksii Mikhailovich Lavrent'ev, taught mathematics at a technical college in Kazan and later was a professor of mathematics at Kazan University. His mother was Anisa Mikhailovna. When Mikhail Alekseevich was nearly ten years old, his father went to Germany to study at GÃ¶ttingen and took his family with him. During the year\n1910\n-\n11\nthat Aleksii Mikhailovich studied mathematics at GÃ¶ttingen, his son Mikhail Alekseevich attended school in the city. It was during this trip to GÃ¶ttingen that Aleksii Mikhailovich met another Russian,\nNikolai Nikolaevich Luzin\n, who was studying there with\nEdmund Landau\n. Aleksii Mikhailovich and Nikolai Nikolaevich became good friends and, after returning to Russia,\nLuzin\noften visited the Lavrent'ev home in Kazan. Luzin had a very strong influence on Aleksii Mikhailovich's young son. After this year in Germany, the Lavrent'ev family returned to Kazan and Mikhail Alekseevich continued his education at a six-year commercial college. At this stage in his studies, it was chemistry that interested Lavrent'ev most. However, there is a story told that one day when his parents were out visiting, he took the opportunity to carry out some chemical experiments on the table in his home. The chemicals reacted strongly, damaging the table and giving off clouds of black smoke. When his parents returned and saw the damage to their home they told Lavrent'ev that he had to give up chemistry. After this he turned to mathematics.\nIn\n1918\n, he entered the Faculty of Physics and Mathematics of Kazan State University after graduating from the commercial college and he studied there for three years. At this time he was particularly influenced by two of his lecturers, Evgenii Aleksandrovich Bolotov\n(1870\n-\n1922)\nand Dmitrii Nikolayevich Zeyliger. However, in\n1921\nLavrent'ev's father was appointed as a professor of mathematics at Moscow State University and the family moved to Moscow. Lavrent'ev moved with his family and continued his studies at Moscow State University, graduating in\n1922\n. After arriving in Moscow, in addition to his studies, Lavrent'ev taught mathematics at Moscow Higher Technical School. He would continue to keep this post until\n1929\n.\nAt Moscow University, Lavrent'ev had been taught by his father's friend\nNikolai Nikolaevich Luzin\namong others and, after graduating, he continued to undertake research on set theory and topology advised by\nLuzin\n. He studied under\nLuzin\nfrom\n1922\nto\n1926\n, then in\n1927\n, after successfully defending his candidate's thesis on set theory, he was sent to France to study in Paris for six months. This was an important time for the young mathematician who was advised by\nPaul Montel\n, attended lectures by\nÃmile Borel\n,\nGaston Julia\nand\nHenri Lebesgue\n, and participated in\nJacques Hadamard\n's seminar. At this stage in his career, Lavrent'ev stopped his research in set theory and topology, moving towards the theory of complex variables. This was due to the Paris school where variational methods in the theory of\nconformal mappings\nwere being developed. Returning to Moscow near the end of\n1927\n, he was appointed as an assistant professor at Moscow State University and delivered a course on conformal mappings. Also at this time he became a member of the\nMoscow Mathematical Society\n. The year\n1929\nwas one of great importance for Lavrent'ev. He was appointed as a professor and head of the department of mathematics at the Moscow Institute of Chemical Technology. Also in\n1929\nhe was invited by\nSergei Alekseevich Chaplygin\nto accept the post of senior engineer at the\nZhukovsky\nCentral Institute of Fluid Dynamics. This Institute, set up by\nNikolai Egorovich Zhukovsky\nand\nSergei Alekseevich Chaplygin\nin\n1918\n, provided a remarkable research environment. It was, at this time, directed by\nChaplygin\n(\nZhukovsky\nhad died several years before\n)\nand Lavrent'ev became one of the leading scientists at the Institute. At the Institute\n[\n31\n]\n:-\n... he obtained many classical results in fluid dynamics. To a considerable extent, they are related to the problems of aerodynamics and strength of airplanes. Lavrent'ev gave excellent examples of practical application of theoretical solutions. For example, he applied variational properties of conformal mappings and reduced the important problem of flow around a wing to the solution of a singular\nintegral equation\nof the first kind. In his works written together with\nMstislav Vsevolodovich Keldysh\n, important results obtained in the theory of conformal mappings were used for the solution of numerous applied problems. For example, the problem of rigid impact against water was solved and the motion of a wing under the surface of a heavy liquid was investigated; the latter result became the theoretical foundation for a rapidly developing branch of contemporary hydrodynamics\n(\nthe theory of hydrofoils\n)\n.\nMstislav Vsevolodovich Keldysh\nhad been a student of Lavrent'ev's at Moscow State University and, after he graduated in\n1931\n, Lavrent'ev recommended that he be appointed to the\nZhukovsky\nCentral Institute of Fluid Dynamics.\nKeldysh\nand Lavrent'ev produced several important joint papers as indicated in the quotation above. Lavrent'ev was appointed as a professor at Moscow State University in\n1931\nand from\n1933\nhe held the chair of the Theory of Functions of a Complex Variable at the\nSteklov\nInstitute of Mathematics of the\nUSSR Academy of Sciences\n. The\nSteklov\nMathematical Institute, together with some other institutions of the\nUSSR Academy of Sciences\n, had been moved from Leningrad to Moscow in\n1933\n. He was awarded his doctorate in engineering\n(\nequivalent to a D.Sc.\n)\nby Moscow State University in\n1934\nand, in the following year, his doctorate in mathematical sciences without having to defend a thesis. Over the years\n1927\n-\n1938\nhe published a number of fundamental results in the theory of functions of complex variable and laid the foundations of a new mathematical theory, namely the theory of quasiconformal mappings.\nIn\n1932\nLavrent'ev's son, Mikhail Mikhailovich Lavrent'ev, was born in Moscow. He studied at Moscow State University, graduating in\n1954\n. His thesis advisor was\nSergei L'vovich Sobolev\n. He worked at the Siberian Division of the USSR Academy of Sciences from\n1957\n, specialising in ill-posed problems in mathematical physics. Mikhail Mikhailovich's son, Mikhail Mikhailovich Jr, was born in\n1956\n. He is also a mathematician who, after studying at Novosibirsk State University, was awarded a Ph.D. for his work on\ndifferential equations\nin\n1982\n.\nFrom\n1939\nto\n1941\nand then again from\n1944\nto\n1949\n, Mikhail Alekseevich Lavrent'ev was the Director of the Institute of Mathematics of the\nUkrainian Academy of Sciences\nin Kiev. He was appointed to this role following the death of the previous director,\nDmitry Aleksandrovich Grave\n, in December\n1939\n. In\n1945\nLavrent'ev was also appointed vice-president of the\nUkrainian Academy of Sciences\n. During\n1945\n-\n1948\nhe was a professor in the Physics and Mathematics Faculty of the Kiev State University.\nYurii Alekseevich Mitropolskii\nwrites\n[\n31\n]\n:-\nIn the Kiev period of his scientific work ..., Lavrent'ev extensively developed his main results in mathematics and mechanics and obtained new important\n(\ntheoretical and applied\n)\nresults. ... First, in this period, his role as a remarkable Soviet scientist, prominent organizer of science, and outstanding public figure was finally formed. Second, the scientific activity of Lavrent'ev had a considerable influence on the development of mathematics and mechanics in  Ukraine. Here he carried out a large amount of work devoted to the development of physical and mathematical sciences and created a ramified school in the theory of functions of complex variables and its applications to the mechanics of continua. The scientific work carried out at the Institute of Mathematics of the\nUkrainian Academy of Sciences\nunder the guidance of Lavrent'ev was aimed at the solution of not only fundamental theoretical problems but also numerous important applied problems. A great merit of Lavrent'ev lies in the fact that he resolutely directed the theoretical investigations at the Institute of Mathematics of the\nUkrainian Academy of Sciences\ntowards the solution of the urgent problems of national economy.\nLavrent'ev's Kiev period has a break from\n1941\nto\n1944\nwhich, of course, coincides with the period in which the Soviet Union was at war with Germany. The Molotov-Ribbentrop non-aggression pact between Germany and the Soviet Union meant that the initial years of the war had little effect on life in Kiev and Lavrent'ev continued his work there. However, things changed dramatically on\n22\nJune\n1941\nwhen Germany broke the non-aggression pact and invaded the Soviet Union. Kiev was soon threatened by the advancing German armies\n(\nthey entered the city on\n19\nSeptember\n1941)\nand the\nUkrainian Academy of Sciences\nwas relocated to the city of Ufa. Lavrent'ev, along with several other leading scientists, approached the government with a proposal to undertake scientific research directly related to the development of military equipment. One of the projects Lavrent'ev worked on was the creation of a silencer for a gun. He also worked on the use of explosions in the construction industry, in particular in the construction of dams. By the end of\n1943\nSoviet troops had liberated Kiev and in the following year Lavrent'ev returned to the city when the\nUkrainian Academy of Sciences\nreturned. He was awarded the Order of the Patriotic War\n(\nSecond Class\n)\nin\n1944\nfor his contributions to the war effort.\nThen, in\n1950\n, he became director of the Institute of Mechanics and Computational Technology of Ukraine. He was appointed as Academic Secretary of the Department of Physics and Mathematical Sciences of the\nUSSR Academy of Sciences\nin\n1951\nand, in the same year, became a professor at Moscow State University. In\n1955\nhe was appointed as head of the Department of Physics of Fast Processes of the Moscow Physical-Technical Institute.\nLavrent'ev moved to Novosibirsk when he was vice-president of the\nUSSR Academy of Sciences\nbetween\n1957\nand\n1975\n. During this time he was Head of the Siberian Division of the\nAcademy of Sciences of the USSR\n. One of his achievements was the foundation of Akademgorodok, or 'Academic Town', situated just outside Novosibirsk\n(\ntoday it is a district of Novosibirsk\n)\n. The idea was to attract leading scientists from the west of the Soviet Union to Siberia and this was achieved by building the necessary homes, schools and institutions to provide an attractive environment for scientists. The residents often called Lavrent'ev the 'grandfather' of Akademgorodok. From\n1959\nto\n1966\nhe was a professor at Novosibirsk State University and he gained high international recognition, being vice-president of the International Mathematical Union from\n1966\nto\n1970\n. Then, in\n1975\n, Lavrent'ev returned to Moscow where he worked at the Institute of Physics and Technology until his death. However, during this period he was Honorary Chairman of the Siberian Branch of the\nUSSR Academy of Sciences\nand made visits to Novosibirsk.\nWe have already indicated some of the areas on which Lavrent'ev worked but we now summarise his contributions.\nYurii Alekseevich Mitropolskii\nwrites\n[\n31\n]\n:-\nThe scope of scientific investigations of Lavrent'ev, a world-known scientist who made a large contribution to the world science, was extremely wide. His outstanding scientific results in mathematics and its applications substantially affected the development of the theory of functions of complex variables, theory of differential equations, hydrodynamics, theory of motion of underground water, theory of long waves, dynamic stability, theory of cumulation, and many other fields of science and engineering.\nHe is remembered for an outstanding book on conformal mappings\nConformal Mappings and Their Applications to Certain Problems of Mechanics\n(1946)\nand he made many important contributions to that topic. In the\n1940\ns he developed the theory of quasi-conformal mappings which gave a new geometrical approach to\npartial differential equation\ns. One of the major areas to which he applied this work was to hydrodynamics. The\n1940\ns was a period of industrialisation and construction and, after\n1945\n, Lavrent'ev founded new areas of research in mechanics and applied physics which were aimed at laying the theoretical foundation necessary for the large construction projects of building dams, canals and bridges on the Volga, Dnieper and Don rivers. He also applied the theory of complex variables to other topics, in particular to non-linear waves in important papers such as\nOn the theory of long waves\n(1943)\n. Other topics where he made substantial contributions were the theory of sets, the general theory of functions, and the theory of differential equations.\nMany international honours were given to Lavrent'ev in addition to those mentioned above. He was elected to the\nCzechoslovak Academy of Sciences\n(1957)\n, the\nBulgarian Academy of Sciences\n(1966)\n, the International Academy of Astronautics\n(\ncorresponding member\n1966\n, full member\n1970)\n, the\nBerlin Academy of Science\n(1969)\n, the\nFinnish Academy of Science and Letters\n(1969)\n, the\nParis Academy of Sciences\n(1971)\n, the\nGerman Academy of Scientists Leopoldina\n(1971)\n, and the\nPolish Academy of Sciences\n(1971)\n. He was awarded the M V Lomonosov Gold Medal\n(1977)\n:-\n... for outstanding achievements in mathematics and mechanics.\nHe has received many other honours. For example, the Institute of Hydrodynamics of the Siberian Division of the\nUSSR Academy of Sciences\nwhich Lavrent'ev founded was named after him in\n1980\n. Several towns have streets named after him, a specialist mathematical school has been named after him, as has a research vessel. Other honours he received from his own country include being awarded the Order of the Red Banner of Labour four times\n(1945\n,\n1948\n,\n1953\n,\n1954)\nand the Order of Lenin five times\n(1953\n,\n1956\n,\n1960\n,\n1967\n,\n1975)\n. He also received the Order of the October Revolution\n(1970)\nfrom his own country and he was made Commander of the LÃ©gion d'honneur by France in\n1971\n.\nAlthough he died in Moscow, Lavrent'ev was buried in the Cherbuzinskom cemetry in Novosibirsk. We end this biography by quoting Vladimir Mikhailovich Titov\n(1933\n-\n)\n, one of Lavrent'ev's postgraduate students who became one of his closest collaborators at the Siberian Division of the\nUSSR Academy of Sciences\n:-\nUp to the end of his life, Lavrent'ev, as a scientist, did not get tired of wondering at mysteries of the nature and trying to solve them. In fact, he was a prominent naturalist in the widest sense of this word, which becomes obsolete in our time of high specialization. His extraordinary intuition and capability of applying methods developed in one field of science to a different field and constructing models of phenomena paradoxical at the first sight astonished those who knew him and worked by his side."
