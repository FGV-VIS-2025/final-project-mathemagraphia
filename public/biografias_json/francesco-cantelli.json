  "biografia": "Francesco Cantelli\n's parents Vicenzo Cantelli and Giulia Pizzoli. He studied pure mathematics at the University of Palermo, graduating in\n1899\n. He wrote a thesis there on celestial mechanics\nSulla parentesi di Lagrange con applicazione al moto perturbato dei pianeti\nâ\n(\nOn the brackets of Lagrange with application to the perturbed motion of the planets\n)\nand this work on perturbations of the planets was published in\n1900\n. While he was still a student, in\n1897\n, he began working at the nearby Observatory and also, from\n1899\nto\n1903\n, he taught mathematics in secondary schools. Palermo Observatory, where Cantelli worked, had been quite famous. Its most important discovery had been\n100\nyears before Cantelli worked there, on\n1\nJanuary\n1801\n, when the asteroid Ceres was discovered. However, it had become less important over the years and was not at the forefront of research at the time Cantelli worked there\n[\n8\n]\n:-\nIn his initial research, at the Observatory in Palermo, he tried to verify if the position of the stars mentioned by Dante in the 'Divina Commedia' corresponded either to the year\n1300\nor to the year\n1301\n. Cantelli's investigation confirmed the hypothesis favouring the year\n1301\n.\nCantelli's work in astronomy involved statistical analysis of data and his interests turned more towards the statistical style of mathematics and to applications of\nprobability\nto astronomy and other areas. In particular he became interested in actuarial and social applications of probability theory. In\n1903\ntook a job as an actuary at the Istituti di Previdenza where he undertook research into probability theory publishing some important papers, some which we mention below. He founded the Istituto Italiano degli Attuari for the applications of mathematics and probability to economics. He edited the journal of the Institute\nGiornale dell'Istituto Italiano degli Attuari\nfrom\n1930\nto\n1958\nduring which time it became one of the leading journals in its field.\nIn\n1922\n, while still working as an actuary at the Istituti di Previdenza, Cantelli qualified to teach in universities. In the following year he resigned his position as an actuary and moved to the University of Catania where he was professor of actuarial mathematics. In\n1925\nCantelli was called to Naples where he taught actuarial and financial mathematics. From\n1931\nhe was professor at the University of Rome where he remained for the rest of his life, retiring from his chair in\n1951\n.\nHis first papers were on problems in astronomy and celestial mechanics and he wrote on\nLagrange\n's method of studying perturbations of the planets. His later work was all on probability, frequency distributions, actuarial science and applications of probability theory. Around\n1900\nprogress in mathematical probability theory was in large part due to the French and to the Russians, and progress in mathematical statistics was mainly due to the British. However others made important contributions, and a number of Italians, including Cantelli,\nCastelnuovo\nand\nde Finetti\n, did outstanding work in this area. Benzi writes\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nThe years between the two World Wars seem to have been a 'golden age' of research on the foundations of probability in Italy. ...  from\n1900\nto\n1915\n[\nthere was\n]\nan interest in the foundational problems of probability, a conviction that logic would play a role in resolving these problems, and varying conceptions of logic, all of which predate and serve as a historical foundation for this 'golden age'.\nShe also writes in\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nFor some decades F P Cantelli was one of the most prominent Italian contributors to the mathematical theory of probability. Although his name is frequently connected with the name of\nE Borel\n, Cantelli's approach to probability is very different from that of\nBorel\n.\nCantelli's first publications on probability examined the foundations of the subject in connection with logic, for example in\nSui fondamenti del calcolo delle probabilitÃ\nâ\n(\nOn the foundations of probability\n)\n(1905)\n. He proved the strong law of large numbers, a result which was proved independently by\nMazurkiewicz\n. On this topic he published\nSulla legge dei grandi numeri\nâ\n(\nOn the law of large numbers\n)\nin\n1916\n. In the same year he published\nLa tendenza a un limite nel senso del calcolo delle probabilitÃ\n;\nâ\n(\nThe convergence to a limit in the sense of probability;\n)\n. He continued to develop these ideas in\nSulla probabilitÃ  comme limite di frequenza\nâ\n(\nOn probability seen as a limit of frequencies\n)\nand\nSu due applicazioni di un teorema di G Boole alla statistica matematica\nâ\n(\nOn two applications of a theorem of Boole to mathematical statistics\n)\nboth published in the following year. These papers contributed to the debate among some Italian mathematicians about the possibility of defining probability in terms of relative frequencies. Cantelli, in his work on the law of large numbers, was developing ideas which had been first suggested by\nJacob Bernoulli\nin the\n17\nth\ncentury. The expression \"law of large numbers\" was introduced somewhat later by\nPoisson\nwho studied the weak law of large numbers\n(\nas did\nChebyshev\nin his thesis\n)\n. Around the time that Cantelli worked on the law of large numbers,\nBorel\nwas also interested in the topic. Regazzini writes\n[\n8\n]\n:-\n... he formulated an abstract theory of probability shortly before the publication of\nKolmogorov\n's 'Grundbegriffe' so ... he was not in a position to deal with random variables as measurable functions and, moreover, considered, implicitly, probability as a completely additive function on a family of events, without emphasizing the role of such a hypothesis in restricting the class of the admissible probability assessments. In spite of these aspects, the Cantelli treatment of stochastic convergence turns out to be exceptionally transparent and quite satisfactory even with respect to the present expositions of the subject.\nFinancial mathematics was also a topic of Cantelli's research. In this area he published\nIntorno ad un teorema fondamentale della teoria del rischio\nâ\n(\nOn a fundamental theorem of the theory of risk\n)\n(1910)\nand\nGenesi e costruzione delle travole di mutalitÃ\nâ\n(\nGenesis and construction of mortality tables\n)\n(1914)\n. In the first of these papers he generalised the\nBienaymÃ©\n-\nChebyshev\ninequality."
