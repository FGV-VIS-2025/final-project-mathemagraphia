  "biografia": "Otto SzÃ¡sz\nstudied at the University of Budapest but he went from there to GÃ¶ttingen, Munich and Paris where he greatly broadened his education. He received his doctorate in\n1911\nfrom the University of Budapest and was appointed onto the staff there as a privatdozent. From\n1914\nhe lectured in Frankfurt, first as a\nprivatdozent\nand then later as a professor, being a colleague of\nBieberbach\nfor\n6\nyears.\nIn\n1933\nthe Nazis came to power in Germany and SzÃ¡sz was forced out of his chair at Frankfurt. It was a period of extraordinary hardship for many mathematicians in Germany, Poland, Hungary and countries around them. Many mathematicians, like SzÃ¡sz, lost their positions. Others suffered far greater hardships; some were sent to concentration camps, many were murdered. However, there was a positive side effect which changed the course of mathematical research in the United States, for many of these top quality European mathematicians went there and, to the country's credit, it did an exceptional job in accepting them and helping them to find positions.\nSzÃ¡sz, like many others, left Germany and emigrated to the United States in\n1933\n. His initial position was at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. His next post was at Brown University and then, in\n1936\n, he was appointed to the Faculty of the University of Cincinnati where he spent the rest of his career. He did make a research visit spending a year at the Institute of Numerical Analysis at the University of California in Los Angeles but he seemed content to devote the rest of his life to teaching, research, and his students in Cincinnati\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nHis steady preoccupation with mathematics, his erudition and broad knowledge of classical and contemporary literature and his perseverance in dealing with open problems of a number of varied fields have secured a firm place for him in the mathematical life of Hungary, Germany and of the United States.\nSzÃ¡sz's main work was in real analysis, particularly\nFourier series\n. In fact his most notable research was done before he emigrated to the United States, but this was not too surprising since he was in his fiftieth year when he emigrated. His most important contributions are probably between\n1915\nand\n1930\nwhen he made a series of remarkable contributions to a number of different areas.\nSome of his earliest work was on\ncontinued fractions\nin which he studied certain convergence questions.\nPerron\n, influenced by\nPringsheim\nat Munich, had published an important work on continued fractions\nDie Lehre von den KettenbrÃ¼chen\nâ\n(\nThe theory of continued fractions\n)\nin\n1913\n. SzÃ¡sz generalised some of\nPerron\n's results and also, in\n1915\n, published a paper proving one of\nPerron\n's conjectures. A few years before SzÃ¡sz began his mathematical researches,\nSergei Bernstein\nhad made major contributions to the theory of approximation.\nBernstein\nstated a problem concerning the completeness of a certain set of powers on an interval and, although SzÃ¡sz did not solve this problem, he did make contributions which were themselves important in the development of the theory of approximations.\nOther work by SzÃ¡sz made major contributions to questions posed by Landau on the maximum modulus of the partial sums of a power series. He also studied problems on power series related to work of Frigyes\nRiesz\n. In fact SzÃ¡sz worked on problems associated with both Riesz brothers, and he gave a very simple proof a theorem by\nMarcel Riesz\non\nrational functions\nwith given bounds on the unit circle. Some of SzÃ¡sz's contributions to Fourier series related to results proved by\nBernstein\n,\nHardy\n,\nLittlewood\nand\nFejÃ©r\n.\nAll these results were achieved before\n1933\nand many of the mathematicians we have mentioned, such as\nPerron\n,\nPringsheim\n,\nEdmund Landau\n, and\nFejÃ©r\nwere all SzÃ¡sz's personal friends. His major contribution during the years from\n1915\nto\n1930\nwas recognised by the Hungarian Mathematical and Physical Society in\n1939\nwhen they awarded him their\nJulius KÃ¶nig\nprize.\nWe must not give the impression, however, that SzÃ¡sz did not make any research contributions after emigrating to the United States. His work in this later period was mainly on\n[\n1\n]\n:-\n... Tauberian theorems, various methods of summability,\nGibbs\nphenomenon, etc.\nThe following tribute to SzÃ¡sz is made by\nSzegÅ\nin\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nHis students and friends will always warmly remember him as a man of gentle, unassuming and quiet personality. His life and energy were dedicated to the promotion of simple and beautiful problems of mathematics, in particular of the classical analysis. His nearly one hundred and thirty mathematical papers remain a living document of his efforts."
