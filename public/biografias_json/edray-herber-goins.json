  "biografia": "Edray Herber Goins\nwas born in South Central Los Angeles and, given the Acknowledgement in his thesis, seems to have been brought up by his mother, Eddi Beatrice Goins, and her godfather, William Herber Dailey. He writes:-\nThe author would like to give ultimate credit to his mother, Eddi Beatrice Goins, and her godfather, William Herber Dailey, for constant guidance, support, and protection over the years.\nEdray Goins was brought up along with his brother. From the Abstract of the talk\nFrom the Diary of a Black Mathematician: My Journey from South Central to Studying Dessins d'Enfants\nhe gave in\n2015\nto the University of Michigan's \"Dr Marjorie Lee Browne Colloquium\" we have the following details. In\n1939\n, Annie Beatrice Brown gave birth in Marshall, Texas, to Eddi Beatrice Brown. She spent a majority of the years\n1936\n-\n1942\ntaking classes in education at Bishop College - alternating between taking classes in education and being a stay-at-home mother. Eddi Beatrice Brown became a teacher, married Goins, and in\n1972\nshe gave birth to Edray Herber Goins, the subject of this biography, in South Central Los Angeles.\nEdray said that his mother and other teachers in the Los Angeles Unified public school system that he attended encouraged and motivated him to study hard and to take on additional learning challenges\n[\n9\n]\n:-\nEven at young age, Edray had a thirst for knowledge. He asked his teachers to let him study ahead or subjects not part of the curriculum.\nHe was highly successful at high school and in\n1989\nwon the Bronze Medal in Mathematics from the Los Angeles Academic Decathlon.\nThe Preliminary Scholastic Assessment Test at the time that Goins was at high school consisted of a mathematics section and a verbal section. The National Merit Scholarship Corporation established the National Achievement Scholarship Program in\n1964\nwhich aims to recognize outstanding black American high school students. Black students may enter both this programme and the National Merit programme by taking the Preliminary Scholastic Assessment Test. In\n1989\nGoins received a National Merit Scholarship Honourable Mention, and in the following year he graduated from High School and was awarded a National Achievement Scholarship. This was not the only scholarship he received before entering the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, California, for in\n1990\nhe also received a Roy A Wilkins Scholarship from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, a Sigma Pi Phi Scholarship, and a Robert A Millikan Physics Scholarship from the California Institute of Technology.\nAt the California Institute of Technology he quickly realised that he wanted be become a mathematics researcher. He said\n[\n4\n]\n:-\nI knew at a pretty early stage in my life - my freshman year of college, to be exact - that I wanted to become a research mathematician.\nHe showed his abilities from his first year, being awarded the Morgan Ward Mathematics Prize in both\n1991\nand\n1992\n. The California Institute of Technology gives the following information about this prize:-\nThe Morgan Ward Prize was established by the Department of Mathematics in\n1963\nto honour the memory of Professor Morgan Ward in recognition of his long service to mathematics and to the Institute.  The competition is open to all freshmen and sophomores, regardless of major.  An entry consists of a mathematical problem together with a solution or a significant contribution toward a solution. ... The problem may have any source, but this source should be stated in the entry. The entries may be judged on the basis of the nature of the problem, originality and elegance of the solution.\nHe also won a\n1991\n-\n92\nAmerican Physical Society Scholarship. In\nPhysics Today\n(\nNovember\n1991)\ndetails of these scholarships are given:-\nThe American Physical Society has awarded corporate-sponsored scholarships for the\n1991\n-\n92\nacademic year to\n22\nminority students who are majoring in physics. ... Scholarships are awarded to African-American, Hispanic American or Native American students who are high school seniors or college freshmen or sophomores. Selections are based on academic grades and achievement, personal statements ... and letters of reference. Each scholarship consists of $\n2000\n, which can be used for tuition, room and board, and can be renewed once.\nIndeed Goins' American Physical Society Scholarship was renewed for the year\n1992\n-\n93\n. Also in\n1993\nhe was awarded a Los Angeles Philanthropic Foundation scholarship which is for students who have a financial aid need and are involved in extra-curricular school activities and community service. At the California Institute of Technology, Goins was advised by the mathematics professor Dinakar Ramakrishnan and the theoretical physics professor Steven C Frautschi. In June\n1994\n, Goins graduated with a B.S. majoring in Mathematics and Physics. He had won several awards during his undergraduate years at the California Institute of Technology, namely the Dean's Cup for Service\n(1993)\n, the Doris S Perpall Speaking Award for best presentation in the Humanities\n(1993)\n, and the Rodman W Paul History Prize\n(1994)\n.\nIn\n1994\nGoins was awarded a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship\n(\nHonourable Mention\n)\nand a National Physical Science Consortium Graduate Fellowship which enabled him to begin research for a Ph.D. at Stanford University. During the summers of\n1995\nand\n1996\nhe held a Summer Internship from June to August at the National Security Agency, Fort George Meade, Maryland. In\n1996\nhe was given the Outstanding Graduate Student award from the Black Community Services Center, Stanford University. His thesis advisors at Stanford were Daniel Willis Bump and Karl Cooper Rubin. In\n1999\nhe received a number of awards and honours from Stanford University for his outstanding contributions: the James W Lyons Award for Service, Stanford University; the Graduate Service Award, Graduate Student Council, Stanford University; and the Outstanding Graduate Student, Chicano/Latino Graduate Student Association, Stanford University. He was awarded a Ph.D. in September\n1999\nfor his thesis\nElliptic Curves and Icosahedral Galois Representations\n. Goins gives the following acknowledgements in his thesis:-\nThe author would like to thank his advisor, Dan Bump, for suggesting the original problem; his unofficial co-advisor Karl Rubin for his invaluable suggestions and the realization that the elliptic curve is isogenous to its conjugate; and graduate student William Stein for his help in calculating coefficients via\nCremona\n's modular symbol algorithm. This thesis could not have been completed without their help. The author would also like to thank the following persons for helpful conversations: David Carlton, Jordan Ellenberg, Ralph Greenburg, Kenneth Ribet, and Richard Taylor. Papers from Ki-ichiro Hashimoto and Yuji Hasegawa were also helpful in gaining insight into the properties of Q-curves. All of the research was sponsored by a generous fellowship from the National Physical Science Consortium\n(\nNSPC\n)\nand the National Security Agency\n(\nNSA\n)\n.\nAlthough the date on which he submitted his Ph.D. thesis is shown clearly on a copy on the web as \"August\n1999\n,\" and \"Copyright by Edray Herber Goins\n1999\n,\" Stanford University has a copy of the thesis on their website dated \"October\n2002\n\" and has \"Copyright by Edray Herber Goins\n2003\n.\" This is puzzling but the\n1999\ndate is surely correct since that copy has the signatures of the examiners on it while the\n2002\ncopy does not. In his thesis Goins looked at cases of\nArtin\n's Conjecture and he gives the background at the start of the thesis:-\nIn\n1917\n,\nErich Hecke\nproved a series of results about certain characters which are now commonly referred to as\nHecke\ncharacters; one corollary states that one-dimensional complex\nGalois\nrepresentations give rise to entire L-series. He revealed, through a series of lectures at Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study in the years that followed, the relationship between such representations as generalizations of\nDirichlet\ncharacters and modular forms as the eigenfunctions of a set of commuting self-adjoint operators. Many mathematicians were inspired by his ground-breaking insight and novel proof of both the analytic continuation of the L-series and its functional equation. In the\n1930\n's,\nEmil Artin\nconjectured that a generalization of such a result should be true; that is, irreducible complex projective representations of finite\nGalois\ngroups should also give rise to entire L-series. He came to this conclusion after proving himself that both\n3\n-dimensional and\n4\n-dimensional representations of the simple group of order\n60\n, the alternating group\nA\n5\nA_{5}\nA\n5\nâ\n, give rise to L-series with singularities. In the spirit of\nHecke\n, he phrased his conjecture in terms of both the analytic continuation of the L-series and its functional equation. It is known, due to the insight of\nRobert Langlands\nin the\n1970\n's relating\nHecke\ncharacters with Representation Theory, that in order to prove the conjecture it suffices to prove that such representations are automorphic. This conjecture and has been the motivation for much study in both Algebraic and Analytic Number Theory ever since.\nIn August\n1999\nspent a month as a Mathematical Sciences Research Institute, Berkeley, California, then, in September\n1999\n, he became a postdoctoral fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, New Jersey, holding this position until August\n2000\n. He did however spend April\n2000\nas a Visiting Scholar at Harvard University. After his time at Princeton, he returned to Berkeley in August\n2000\nwhere he was again a postdoctoral fellow until December\n2000\n, spending October\n2000\nas a Visiting Scholar at Purdue University. He spent January\n2001\n- June\n2001\nat the\nMax Planck\nInstitut fÃ¼r Mathematik in Bonn, Germany, returning to the United States to take up the position of Irvine Foundation Instructor of Mathematics at the California Institute of Technology at Pasadena in August\n2001\n. He continued to hold this Instructorship until August\n2003\n, although he spent September\n2001\n- June\n2002\nas a Visiting Scholar at Harvard University. Remaining at the California Institute of Technology at Pasadena, he was appointed as Taussky-Todd Instructor of Mathematics in September\n2003\n. In January\n2004\nhe was featured in\nBlack Issues in Higher Education\nas one of the \"\n2004\nEmerging Scholars of the Year.\" He showed that he fully deserved this honour when in August\n2004\nhe was appointed as Assistant Professor of Mathematics at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana.\nGoins' first two papers appear in the book\nCouncil for African American Researchers in the Mathematical Sciences\n. Vol. III which was published by the\nAmerican Mathematical Society\nin\n2001\n. The book contains papers from the\n3\nrd Conference for African American Researchers in the Mathematical Sciences held at Morgan State University, Baltimore, MD, June\n17\n-\n20\n,\n1997\nand the\n5\nth Conference held at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, June\n22\n-\n25\n,\n1999\n. One of the two papers is\nThe fractional parts of n/k\nwritten jointly with M R Currie and the other is the single-authored paper\nArtin's conjecture and elliptic curves\n. As the first of these gives Goins' address as Stanford University while the second gives his address as Institute for Advanced Study Princeton, we conjecture that the first paper was presented at the\n1997\nconference while the second was presented at the\n1999\nconference. The paper\nArtin's conjecture and elliptic curves\ncontains results from his thesis.\nSeveral of Goins' papers are particularly attractive and at least the problems they studied is understandable without a deep knowledge of mathematics. For example his\n2006\npaper\nHeron triangles via elliptic curves\n(\nwritten with Davin Maddox\n)\nhas a review which begins:-\nA\nHeron\ntriangle is a triangle whose sides\na\n,\nb\n,\nc\na, b, c\na\n,\nb\n,\nc\nand area\nn\nn\nn\nare all rational numbers. In this very pleasant paper, the authors look at the following question: Given\nn\nn\nn\n, how can we decide whether there exists a\nHeron\ntriangle of area equal to\nn\nn\nn\n? This question is similar to the congruent number problem, which asks to determine, given\nn\nn\nn\n, whether there is a Pythagorean triangle with rational sides and area\nn\nn\nn\n.\nThe Abstract of the paper states:-\nGiven a positive integer\nn\nn\nn\n, one may ask if there is a right triangle with rational sides having area\nn\nn\nn\n. Such integers are called congruent numbers, and are closely related to elliptic curves of the form\ny\n2\n=\nx\n3\nâ\nn\n2\nx\ny^{2} = x^{3} - n^{2}x\ny\n2\n=\nx\n3\nâ\nn\n2\nx\n. In this paper, we generalize this idea and show that there is a correspondence between positive integers\nn\nn\nn\nassociated with arbitrary triangles with rational sides having area\nn\nn\nn\nand the family of elliptic curves\ny\n2\n=\nx\n(\nx\nâ\nn\nÏ\n(\nx\n+\nn\nÏ\nâ\n1\n)\n)\ny^{2} = x(x - n\\tau (x+n\\tau^{-1}))\ny\n2\n=\nx\n(\nx\nâ\nn\nÏ\n(\nx\n+\nn\nÏ\nâ\n1\n)\n)\nfor nonzero rational Ï.\nAnother lovely paper is Goins' paper\nPalindromes in different bases: A conjecture of J Ernest Wilkins\n(2009)\n. We quote a review by Clemens Fuchs:-\nIn this amusing paper the author proves that there exist exactly\n203\npositive integers\nN\nN\nN\n, which are all explicitly listed, such that\nN\nN\nN\nis a palindrome in base\n10\nwith\nd\nâ¥\n2\nd â¥ 2\nd\nâ¥\n2\ndigits\n(\nd\n=\n1\nd = 1\nd\n=\n1\nwould be trivial\n)\nand\nN\nN\nN\nis at the same time a palindrome with\nd\nd\nd\ndigits in a base\nb\nâ\n10\nb â  10\nb\nî\nâ\n=\n1\n0\n. The smallest such\nN\nN\nN\nis\n22\n, the largest is\n9986831781362631871386899\n, and the possible\nd\nd\nd\n's are\nd\n=\n2\n,\n3\n,\n4\n,\n5\n,\n6\n,\n7\n,\n9\n,\n11\n,\n13\n,\n15\n,\n17\n,\n19\n,\n21\n,\n23\n,\n25.\nd = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25.\nd\n=\n2\n,\n3\n,\n4\n,\n5\n,\n6\n,\n7\n,\n9\n,\n1\n1\n,\n1\n3\n,\n1\n5\n,\n1\n7\n,\n1\n9\n,\n2\n1\n,\n2\n3\n,\n2\n5\n.\nThis verifies a conjecture by\nJ Ernest Wilkins\nthat there is no such\nN\nN\nN\nwith\n8\ndigits and that the only even\nd\nd\nd\n's for which there is such an\nN\nN\nN\nare\nd\n=\n2\n,\n4\n,\n6\nd = 2, 4, 6\nd\n=\n2\n,\n4\n,\n6\n. The result is obtained from two simple lemmas\n(\nboth suggested by\nWilkins\n)\nand exhaustive brute-force computer search implemented in 'Mathematica'. The computer code and the complete output list are given. The parallel search on twenty processors took about fifteen months. The paper ends with an open problem for future research.\nGoins was awarded many research grants, most having the theme of promoting mathematical participation by minority groups. For example, the conferences 'Purdue Research in Mathematics Experience\n(\nPRiME\n)\n' brought in:-\n... outside speakers, women of colour in the mathematical sciences, to discuss their professional journey from being an undergraduate student to being a member of the professoriate.\nA goal of the conference\nUnderrepresented Students in Topology and Algebra Research Symposium\nin\n2013\nwas to bring together young researchers in algebra and topology from diverse backgrounds and to expose undergraduate students to research opportunities. Grants won by Goins in\n2016\n,\n2017\nand\n2018\nset up conferences with the aim to \"produce a more diverse professional mathematical workforce.\"\nIn\n2018\nGoins published the fascinating article\nThree Questions: The Journey of One Black Mathematician\nin which he writes\n[\n3\n]\n:-\nI am the president of the '\nNational Association of Mathematicians\n', a professional organization that seeks to increase the public awareness of issues of importance to underrepresented minorities in the mathematical sciences, and I would like to modify these questions and ask you the following:\n'How many African American mathematicians have you graduated?'\n'How many African American mathematicians have you hired?'\n'Why?'\nYou can read a version of that article, in which he explains why on his personal journey to become a full professor these question were so significant, at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nShortly after writing this article, Goins resigned from Purdue University and accepted a position at Pomona College from July\n2018\n. He explained his decision in a number of articles and interviews, for example in\n[\n4\n]\n. The article\n[\n5\n]\nFor a Black Mathematician, What It's Like to Be the 'Only One'\n, published in\nThe New York Times\nin February\n2019\n, looks at Goins' decision and comments on the reaction, both positive and negative.
