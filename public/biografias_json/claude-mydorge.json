  "biografia": "Claude Mydorge\ntrained as a lawyer but really had little need to work as he came from a wealthy family. He was able to devote most of his life to research in mathematics without having the problems of earning a salary. His father Jean Mydorge was a councillor in the Parlement in Paris and a judge in the Grande Chambre. His mother, Mme Lamoignon, was from another leading French family.\nHis first position was as a councillor at the ChÃ¢telet and then he was treasurer of the gÃ©nÃ©ralitÃ© of Amiens. A gÃ©nÃ©ralitÃ© was a French administrative unit, each under a \"collector general\"\n(\ngiving the unit its name\n)\nwho was a direct agent of the king with wide police, justice, and financial powers. The position of treasurer general was a later addition to the gÃ©nÃ©ralitÃ©s which came about after\n1577\n. This position was an ideal one for Mydorge for it was a high ranking important position, and therefore a worthy one for a member of a leading French family, yet it had light duties which meant that Mydorge could devote a large amount of his time to the subject he loved, namely mathematics. In\n1613\nhe married Mme de la Haye, the sister of the French ambassador in Constantinople.\nMydorge studied geometry and physics. He published books on optics and\nconic sections\n, for example\nDe sectionibus conicis, libri quattuor\nâ\n(\nOn conic sections, Book four\n)\n(\nParis,\n1644)\ncontains a wealth of new examples and ideas which were used by many later geometers. Speziali writes in\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nA further portion of the work, in manuscript, is lost. It seems that two English friends of the Mydorge family, William Cavendish, Duke of Newcastle, and Thomas Wriothesley, Earl of Southampton, took it to England, where apparently it disappeared.\nMydorge's work simplifies many of\nApollonius\n's proofs. However, it contains a new powerful idea, namely that of deforming figures. For example he shows how to deform a circle into an ellipse and proves other results on deforming conic sections. The technique was taken up by\nLa Hire\nand\nNewton\n, then later by\nPoncelet\nand\nChasles\n.\nHe was interested in mathematical recreations and edited\nRÃ©crÃ©ations MathÃ©matiques\nâ\n(\nMathematical recreations\n)\n. Mydorge's book\nExamen du livre des rÃ©crÃ©ations mathÃ©matiques\nâ\n(\nExamining the mathematical recreation book\n)\nwas published in\n1630\nand many later books, such as one by Denis Henrion\nLes RÃ©crÃ©ations mathÃ©matiques avec l'examen de ses problÃ¨mes en arithmÃ©tique, gÃ©omÃ©trie, mÃ©canique, cosmographie, optique, catoptrique\n...\nâ\n(\nMathematical recreations with the examination of its problems in arithmetic, geometry, mechanics, cosmography, optics, catoptrics ...\n)\n(1659)\n, were based on it.\nMydorge left an unpublished manuscript\nTraitÃ© de gÃ©omÃ©trie\nâ\n(\nTreatise on geometry\n)\nof over\n1000\ngeometric problems and their solutions. The\n363\nrd\nproblem gives a method to transform a square into a regular polygon of equal area and having an arbitrary number of sides. As an example of the type of problem in the manuscript we give the following example. Mydorge proposes a construction of a regular heptagon with a given side:-\nUpon the given side ab, with midpoint g, construct the equilateral triangle abc and extend the altitude gc to point d such that cd is one-sixth ab. Then c is the centre of the circle circumscribing the desired heptagon, and the construction is easily completed.\nHowever Mydorge does not state that the construction is only an approximation. In\n[\n2\n]\nBusard examines the magnitude of the error in this and other constructions of Mydore in\nTraitÃ© de gÃ©omÃ©trie\nâ\n(\nTreatise on geometry\n)\n.\nIt was not only mathematical problems which interested Mydorge. He also worked on light and\nrefraction\nin particular. His interest in optics also fitted in with an interest in making astronomical observations. He was a close friend of\nDescartes\nand made a large number of optical instruments for him, the two shared a strong interest in explaining vision, and the instruments and lenses were to help develop theories.\nOne of Mydorge's most famous results was an extremely accurate measurement of the latitude of Paris. He was also interested in methods of determining longitude and was appointed to a committee to determine the whether\nJean-Baptiste Morin\n's methods for determining longitude from the Moon's motion was practical.\nHÃ©rigone\nand\nÃtienne Pascal\nserved with him on this committee.\nSpeziali writes in\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nA friend of\nDescartes\nand an eminent geometer, Mydorge was also well versed in optics. He possessed a lively curiosity and was open to all the new ideas of his age. Like\nFermat\n, he belonged to that elite group of seventeenth-century scientists who pursued science as amateurs but nevertheless made contributions of the greatest importance to one or more fields of knowledge."
