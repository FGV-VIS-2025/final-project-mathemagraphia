  "biografia": "Micaiah John Muller Hill\nwas the son of the Revd Samuel John Hill and Leonora Josephina MÃ¼ller. Samuel John Hill\n(1825\n-\n1891)\nwas a missionary who had been born in Berhampur India, the son of the missionary Micaiah Hill and Mary Beardmore. Samuel John Hill\n[22]\n:-\n... was a missionary of rigid and exemplary character who felt it his duty to live continuously in, and for, India; and it fell to\n[\nthe children's\n]\nmother, although of mixed Danish and Portuguese stock rooted in India, to take the children to Britain for their education. Family means were straitened and the divided home left a deep mark on\n[\nthe children\n]\n.\nSamuel was back in England in\n1837\nwhen his family returned but then they went to Calcutta in\n1842\n. Samuel was accepted as a missionary in Calcutta in\n1852\nand, in the following year, was ordained and married Leonora MÃ¼ller\n(1833\n-\n1917)\nin Calcutta. Samuel and Leonora Hill then went to Berhampur where Micaiah John Muller Hill, the subject of this biography, was born. Their second child Samuel Charles Hill was born in Berhampur in\n1857\nbut the family then returned to England where their next two children, William Kirkpatrick Hill and Mary Ellen Hill, were born in\n1862\nand\n1864\nrespectively. Samuel and Leonora and their two youngest children returned to Berhampur, India where their fifth and last child George Francis Hill was born in\n1867\n. Micaiah John Muller Hill remained in England, however, where he and his brother were educated at the Sons of Missionaries boarding school. In India Samuel John Hill opened a new Anglo-Vernacular School in Berhampur in\n1868\nand took charge of the Berhampur station two years later. In\n1872\nLeonora Hill's health became poor and she returned to London, England, with her three children, arriving on\n8\nAugust.\nLet us record at this point some details of Micaiah John Muller Hill's brothers. Samuel Charles Hill was educated at the Sons of Missionaries School, Blackheath, England and became an historian of India writing a number of popular books. He was a Professor at Dacca College and then in charge of Imperial Record department and Imperial Library in Calcutta. William Kirkpatrick Hill studied at the University of London, and became a schoolmaster, journalist and author. He became Secretary of the Finance Committee of the University of London. George Francis Hill was also educated at the Sons of Missionaries School, Blackheath, studied classics at University College London, and Â joined the Coins and Medals Department of the British Museum. He was knighted in\n1933\n.\nFrom now on let us refer to Micaiah John Muller Hill simply as Hill. As we noted above, he was educated at the Sons of Missionaries School, Blackheath, London. This school was founded as a small boarding school in Walthamstow in\n1842\nfor the sons of Congregational and Baptist missionaries serving overseas. The school moved to a new building in Blackheath, London, in\n1857\nand it was in that building that Hill studied. The headmaster of the school at this time was Edward James Chinnock\n(1842\n-\n1911)\nwho was a historian specialising in Greek who had studied at the University of London. Hill graduated from the Sons of Missionaries School in\n1872\nand, in October of that year, he entered University College, part of the University of London, to study mathematics. There he was taught by\nOlaus Henrici\n, the professor of mathematics, who was making many innovations in teaching at the College.\nAfter only two years of study at University College, Hill graduated with a B.A. in\n1874\nbeing ranked the top student in Mathematical Honours. He continued to study for a Master's Degree and was awarded an M.A. in\n1876\n, winning the Gold Medal in the examinations. Before the award of his M.A. degree from the University of London, Hill had matriculated as a scholar at Peterhouse, University of Cambridge, at the start of the Michaelmas term in\n1875\n. In the Mathematical Tripos examinations of\n1879\nHill was Fourth\nWrangler\n. The Senior Wrangler that year was his fellow student at Peterhouse, Andrew James Campbell Allen\n(1856\n-\n1923)\n, who became a tutor at Peterhouse, Principal of Chester Training College, and finally a Church of England vicar. The Second Wrangler was George Francis Walker\n(1855\n-\n1883)\nwho after being a tutor at Queen's College, became Professor of Mathematics at Auckland, New Zealand in\n1883\nbut drowned a few hours after arriving in Auckland. Although Hill was Fourth Wrangler, he was equal\n1\nst Smith's Prizeman in\n1879\nshowing his outstanding research potential. He had been examined for the Smith's Prize by\nJames Clerk Maxwell\n.\nGeorge Chrystal\nleft the University of St Andrews in\n1879\nwhen appointed to the Chair of Mathematics at the University of Edinburgh. Hill was a candidate to fill the vacant St Andrews chair and he requested a testimonial from\nJames Clerk Maxwell\nto support his candidacy. Hill was unsuccessful,\nScott Lang\nbeing appointed to the St Andrews Chair.\nDespite Hill's highly successful years at Cambridge, he lacked the experience needed for the St Andrews Chair so he returned to University College, London where he was appointed as assistant to\nOlaus Henrici\n. This position was short lived, however, for, in\n1880\n, he was offered the Chair of Mathematics at the Mason Science College, Birmingham which he was pleased to accept. This College had been founded in\n1875\n, five years before Hill was appointed; it went on the become Mason University College in\n1898\nand was incorporated into the University of Birmingham in\n1900\n. In Birmingham, Hill lived in a boarding house. At the time of the\n1881\ncensus he was living as a boarder at\n56\nWheeleys Road, Edgbaston, Birmingham. The house was owned by the widow Caroline Fearn and there were two other boarders living in the house who were both Stocks and Shares Brokers.\nIt was while Hill was in Birmingham that he published his first mathematical papers:\nSome properties of the equations of hydrodynamics\n(1881)\n;\nCalculation of the Equation which determines the Anharmonic Ratios of the Roots of a Quintic\n(1882)\n;\nOn the motion of fluid, part of which is moving rotationally and part irrotationally\n[\nAbstract\n]\n(1883)\n;\nOn the Closed Link Polygons belonging to a system of Co-planar Forces having a Single Resultant\n(1883)\n;\nOn the motion of fluid, part of which is moving rotationally and part irrotationally\n(1884)\n; and\nThe Differential Equations of Cylindrical and Annular Vortices\n(1884)\n.\nIn\n1884\n, after four years in Birmingham, Hill returned to London when he was appointed Professor of Pure Mathematics at University College.\nKarl Pearson\nwas appointed as Professor of Applied Mathematics in the same year. Hill and\nKarl Pearson\nwould remain colleagues at University College for forty years.\nLouis Filon\n, who was a student at University College and later became a colleague of Hill's, writes\n[6]\n:-\nThe life of a professor in a University College in those days was very different from that to which we are now accustomed. Endowed Chairs were the exception and stipends largely consisted of professors' shares of fees, so that there was a strong inducement to make one's teaching popular rather than profound, a temptation fortunately resisted in most cases, certainly in the case of Hill. Assistants were few, and often paid by the professor. When Hill first took up his duties, the department of Mathematics boasted only a single assistant. The bulk of the routine work of undergraduate teaching, such the correction of students' exercises, fell upon the professor, and this work Hill, trained as he had been in a hard school, performed with unflagging energy and zeal, and an unselfish devotion which won him the affection and admiration of generation after generation of students.\nGiven the pressures on Hill in his new appointment, it is not surprising that he published little in the first few years after becoming a professor at University College. He did publish\nOn the Incorrectness of the Rules for contracting the processes of finding the Square and Cube Roots of a Number Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society\n(1886)\nwhich, more than likely, was motivated by his teaching. He begins the paper as follows:-\nThe rule for contracting the process of finding the Square Root. The rule\n(\nsee\nTodhunter\n's 'Algebra'\n)\nis this:-\nWhen\nn\n+\n1\nn+1\nn\n+\n1\nfigures of a square root have been obtained by the ordinary method, n more may be obtained by division only, supposing\n2\nn\n+\n1\n2n+1\n2\nn\n+\n1\nto be the whole number.\nIt will be shown in this paper that the rule cannot always be extended to cases in which the\n2\nn+\n1\nfigures are followed by other figures, as is usually assumed.\nHe began a new research topic with his next paper, however, namely\nOn the c- and p-Discriminants of Ordinary Integrable Differential Equations of the First Order\n(1888)\n. This was a major\n34\n-page paper on singular solutions to differential equations which extended the work of\nArthur Cayley\nin his paper\nOn the theory of the singular solutions of differential equations of the first order\n(1873)\nand of\nOlaus Henrici\nin his paper\nOn Series of Curves, especially on the Singularities of their Envelopes; with Applications to Polar Curves\n(1866)\n. Hill published further important contribution to singular equations with\nOn Node-and Cusp-Loci, which are enveloped by the Tangents at the Cusps\n(1890)\nand\nOn the locus of singular points and lines which occur in connection the theory of the locus of ultimate intersections of a system of surfaces\n(1892)\n. He did not neglect his research on hydrodynamics, however, and he published\nOn some general equations which include the equations of hydrodynamics\n(1889)\nand\nNote on the Motion of a Fluid Ellipsoid under its Own Attraction\n(1891)\n.\nOn\n21\nDecember\n1892\n, Hill married Minna Grace Tarbotton\n(\nknown as Minnie\n)\nat St Saviour's Church, Paddington, London. Minnie\n(1861\n-\n1920)\n, born in Nottingham, was the eldest of the three children of the surveyor and civil engineer Marriott Ogle Tarbotton\n(1834\n-\n1887)\nand his wife Emma Maria Stanfield\n(1832\n-\n1915)\n. Micaiah and Minnie Hill had three children: Roderick Maxwell Hill\n(1894\n-\n1954)\n; Geoffrey Terence Rowland Hill\n(1895\n-\n1955)\n; and Elfrida Lilian Hill Gwendolen\n(1898\n-\n1971)\n, known as Gwen. Let us say a little about the children. Roderick Hill became a fighter pilot during World War I, and was highly decorated for his bravery. Continuing a career in the Royal Airforce, he was Director-General of Research and Development at the Air Ministry at the start of World War II, and then Commander-in-Chief of Fighter Command. After the war he was Rector of Imperial College\n(1948\n-\n1954)\nand Vice-Chancellor of the University of London\n(1953\n-\n54)\n. Geoffrey Hill also became a pilot, saw action in France during World War I and was awarded the military cross. He was wounded and returned to England to become a test pilot. After the war he worked as a test pilot and aeronautical engineer for Hanley Page Ltd. Gwen Hill became a radiologist. She married Reginald Hilton, who became a consultant physician at St Thomas's Hospital. Gwen became Director of the Radiotherapy Department at University College Hospital.\nLet us return to Micaiah Hill's career. He was an active member of the\nLondon Mathematical Society\n, serving on the Council first in\n1886\nand then again for ten years from\n1891\nto\n1901\n. He was Vice-President of the Society in\n1894\n-\n95\n. In\n1894\nhe was elected a fellow of the\nRoyal Society of London\n. Now it is important to understand that Hill started out his research career making significant advances to hydrodynamics and he continued with this interest. His position, however, was Professor of Pure Mathematics at University College, so his teaching was in pure mathematics. Perhaps because of this his interests turned towards teaching and from around\n1897\nhe began to publish papers on teaching mathematics.\nLouis Filon\n, who was taught by Hill, writes about Hill as a teacher in\n[6]\n:-\nAs a teacher he had, to an extraordinary degree, that infinite capacity for taking pains in which\nCarlyle\nsaw the mark of genius; and he possessed that rare quality, which students so keenly appreciate, of never slurring over difficulties: time spent on making a demonstration perfect was always to him time well spent. And he showed great sympathy with the occasionally devious mental processes of beginners and would even, sometimes, adapt his demonstrations to them. The writer remembers, in his student days, sending up to him a solution which, alas! meandered through as many pages as it should have taken lines, arriving at the desired result by a singularly laborious and inelegant process. Hill read patiently and carefully every line, and in the end his only\n(\nand characteristic\n)\ncomment was that it was a \"very courageous \" solution! Above all, he loved his students, a feeling which was universally and deeply reciprocated.\nHis interest in teaching led to him developing ideas about teaching geometry and to being very active in the\nMathematical Association\n. His first publication,\nOn the Fifth Book of Euclid's Elements\nwas read to the Cambridge Philosophical Society in November\n1897\nand published in volume\n16\nof the\nTransactions of the Cambridge Philosophical Society\nin\n1898\n. Hill writes in the Introduction:-\nThe objects of this paperÂ are\n(\nI\n)\nTo draw attention to the indirect character of the argument in the Fifth Book of\nEuclid\n's Elements.\n(\nII\n)\nTo reconstruct the argument showing how the indirectness may be removed.\n(\nIII\n)\nTo develop the theory of ratio from the reconstructed argument.\nIn\n1900\nHill published the book\nThe Contents of the Fifth and Sixth Books of Euclid.\nThe Preface begins:-\nThe object of this work is to remove the chief difficulties felt by those who desire to understand the Sixth Book of\nEuclid\n. It contains nothing beyond the capacity of those who have mastered the first four Books, and has been prepared for their use. It is the result of an experience of teaching the subject extending over nearly twenty years. The arrangement here adopted has been used by the Author in teaching for the past three years and has been more readily understood than the methods in ordinary use, which he had previously employed.\nFor more information about Hill's two books on the Fifth and Sixth Books of\nEuclid\n's\nElements\n, see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nHill was elected President of the London Branch of the\nMathematical Association\nand gave the Presidential Address on\nThe Theory of Proportion\non\n10\nFebruary\n1912\n. His introduction is as follows\n[8]\n:-\nI desire in the first place to express my thanks to the members of the London Branch of the\nMathematical Association\nfor the honour they have done me in electing me to the office of president. I esteem it a privilege to take part in the efforts the Association is making to bring about improvements in the methods of teaching Mathematics.\nIn what position does the work of the Association now stand? Is it in fact in the position described by Sir J J Thomson in his address to the Association of Public School Science Masters? He is reported to have said that he had come to the conclusion that if you have intelligent masters and small classes it does not matter much what theory of education you adopt and if you have not these, well, it does not much matter either.\nThat seems to me to be a counsel of despair. I prefer to take my stand by the side of Professor\nHobson\n, who said two notable things in his recent address on \"The Democratisation of Mathematical Education.\"\nThe first was that the business of this Association was \"the progressive adaptation of methods and matter of teaching to meet the needs of those who lacked any exceptional capacity.\"\nThe second was that \"Education in Mathematics must be pronounced a failure if it did not rise beyond the purely practical aspect to the domain of principle. The most important educational aspect of the subject was an instrument for training boys and girls to think accurately and independently.\"\nC L T Griffith, who was Professor of Mathematics at the Engineering College, Madras, India, had been a student of Hill's at University College London. Griffith tried to gain recognition of the abilities of\nSrinivasa Ramanujan\nand wrote to Hill onÂ\n12\nÂ NovemberÂ\n1912\nÂ sending some of\nRamanujan\n's work and a copy of hisÂ\n1911\nÂ paper on\nBernoulli numbers\n.Â Hill replied to Griffith on\n3\nDecember\n1912\n[24]\n:-\nI am sorry that the twenty years, which have passed since you were with me, prevent me from remembering anything about you but your name.Â As soon as I can get more time I will look into Mr\nRamanujan\n's paper about the\nBernoulli\n's Numbers, but I cannot do this during term time. One thing however is clear. Mr\nRamanujan\nhas fallen into the pitfalls of the very difficult subject of Divergent series.\nHill did read\nRamanujan\n's paper about the Bernoulli numbers quickly and wrote to Griffith again on\n7\nDecember\n1912\n. He makes some correct observations, complains about a lack of \"logical completeness\" but failed to understand\nRamanujan\n's divergent series. See\n[20]\nfor an interesting discussion of Hill's involvement with\nRamanujan\n's work.\nHill's wife Minnie died on\n10\nJanuary\n1920\nat their home,\n39\nWest Heath Drive, Hampstead, Middlesex. He retired three years later but stayed on a further year to allow a successor to be appointed\n[6]\n:-\nWhen he retired in\n1924\nfrom the Chair of Mathematics, his friends asked him in what way he would wish them to commemorate his long connection with University College; and he then, remembering the financial struggle of his early years, expressed the desire that any subscriptions received should be devoted to establishing a Loan Fund by means of which the difficulties of students in straitened circumstances might be temporarily relieved, while their spirit of independence was to be preserved by an undertaking of eventual repayment, so soon as they felt able to do so. It was done according to his wishes, and, indeed, no more fitting memorial could have been found of a life spent in the unselfish service of studious youth. Hill was one of those who fought for the establishment in London of a real teaching University; and from the re-constitution of the University in\n1900\nuntil\n1926\n, when ill-health compelled his retirement, he was a member of its Senate, in which his balanced judgment, ever-courteous modesty, and, above all, his transparent honesty of purpose and that moral atmosphere which radiated from him and impressed all, even the bitterest opponents of his policy, who came into contact with him, soon gained for him a position of ascendancy.\nHis health deteriorated and he began to rapidly lose his sight. He was elected President of the\nMathematical Association\nand gave two presidential addresses. The first\nOn the Teaching of Mathematics\nwas given in\n1927\nand the second\nThe Logical Eye and the Mathematical Eye. Their Outlook on Euclid's Theory of Proportion\ngiven in January\n1928\n. We must note that by the time he gave this second address he was totally blind; one cannot help us seeing irony in his title.\nFor the Introduction to these two addresses, see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nLouis Filon\nwrites\n[6]\n:-\nAlmost to the day of his death he continued at work, contending with surprising success against well-nigh insuperable obstacles, and planning a book on the foundations of Geometry. The end came swiftly and comparatively painlessly on January\n11\nth,\n1929\n.\nHe was cremated on\n14\nJanuary\n1929\nat Golders Green crematorium.\nHill had served on the senate of the University of London from\n1900\nto\n1926\n, and as vice-chancellor from\n1909\nto\n1911\n. Let us end with H H Bellot's tribute to Hill in these roles\n[2]\n:-\n... it was said that by his death the college lost one of the most commanding personalities among its members. No one who sat with him on the many boards and committees concerned with university and college administration could forget the power of his influence, and yet, it was added, he never allowed the administrator or the teacher to eclipse the scholar."
