  "biografia": "Karl Sigmund\nattended the LycÃ©e FranÃ§ais de Vienne, a school founded in\n1946\n. It moved in\n1954\nto the park of the Palais Clam-Gallas. Although it had a number of French pupils, at the time when Karl attended the vast majority of the pupils were Austrian. He makes this interesting comment in\n[\n3\n]\n:-\n... the Vienna of my youth was an intellectual wasteland, the \"town without Jews,\" as novelist Hugo Bettauer had predicted in the\n1920\ns.\nHe graduated with his Baccalaureate in\n1963\nand began his university education at the Institute of Mathematics of the University of Vienna.\nSigmund undertook research advised by\nLeopold Schmetterer\nand was awarded his doctorate in\n1968\nfor his thesis\nÃber VerteilungsmaÃe von MaÃfolgen auf lokalkompakten Gruppen\nâ\n(\nOn distribution measures on locally compact groups\n)\n. He published a paper with the same title in\n1969\nwhich gave conditions for the existence of the distribution measure of a sequence of normalised measures. After completing his doctorate, Sigmund went first as a postdoctoral worker for a year to the University of Manchester in England where he spent the academic year\n1968\n-\n69\n. There he had useful discussions with the probabilist Kalyanapuram Rangachari Parthasarathy\n(\nborn\n1936)\nwho was Professor of Statistics at Manchester in\n1968\n-\n70\n. Sigmund then spent a second postdoctoral year,\n1969\n-\n70\n, at the Institut des Hautes Ãtudes, Bures sur Yvette, France. There he benefitted from discussions with\nStephen Smale\nwho spent the autumn of\n1969\n-\n70\nat the Institut des Hautes Ãtudes.\nSigmund's second paper, published in\n1970\n, was\nGeneric Properties of Invariant Measures for Axiom A-Diffeomorphisms\n. In this he states\n(\nwe have given the names in full\n)\n:-\nIt is a pleasure to thank David Chillingworth, Kalyanapuram Rangachari Parthasarathy,\nStephen Smale\nand especially\nRufus Bowen\nfor helpful suggestions.\nAt the time he was writing this paper\nRufus Bowen\nwas a research student working with\nStephen Smale\n. When Sigmund published this\n1970\npaper he gave his address as Institute of Mathematics, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel. He spent a third postdoctoral year at the Hebrew University where he had many useful discussions with Benjamin Weiss who was an American who had been appointed to the faculty of the Hebrew University in\n1967\n.\nSigmund spent two further years undertaking postdoctoral studies both back in Austria, the academic year\n1971\n-\n72\nbeing spent at the University of Vienna and\n1972\n-\n73\nalso spent in Vienna at the\nAustrian Academy of Sciences\n. In\n1973\nhe was appointed Professor at the Institute of Mathematical Statistics in GÃ¶ttingen, Germany where he spent one year before moving back to Vienna when became a full professor at the Institute for Mathematics, University of Vienna. In the same year,\n1974\n, he married the historian and author Anna Maria; they have one son Willi.\nThroughout the various years leading to his appointment as a full professor in Vienna, Sigmund had continued to work on ergodic theory, measure theory, topological dynamics and dynamical systems. For example, he published\nTopological Dynamics of Transformations Induced on the Space of Probability Measures\nin\n1975\n, a paper written in collaboration with Walter Bauer. In some ways one can see the culmination of his work in these areas as the book\nErgodic Theory on Compact Spaces\n(1976)\n, jointly authored with Manfred Denker and Christian Grillenberger.\nBill Parry\n, in a review, states:-\n... current ergodic theorists will find the book indispensable.\nA major change in the direction of Sigmund's research occurred around\n1977\nafter discussions with the theoretical biochemist Peter Schuster and the mathematical biologist Josef Hofbauer. He explained\n[\n4\n]\n:-\n... the first topics that interested me were in the tradition of\nLudwig Boltzmann\non statistical mechanics - mass action kinetics and physical problems. Very soon, I found extremely interesting problems involving ensembles of beings in population biology, whether it was population ecology, population genetics, or even animal behaviour, it always concerns large populations of interacting agents. In biology, particularly, interesting questions arose because these interacting agents could change their behaviour, in contrast to what physical entities are doing.\nSigmund and Hofbauer began collaborating in\n1978\nand the result of this collaboration was the book\nThe Theory of Evolution and Dynamical Systems\n(1988)\n. For extracts from reviews of this book, see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nThere were other influences on him as he explained in\n[\n4\n]\n:-\nI started applying mathematical models to population ecology and genetics, and just when I gave my very first talk - on Robert Axelrod's book,Â 'The Evolution of Cooperation' - I noticed a student sitting in the front row who was starting to glow. His eyes were getting larger and larger and I found I was talking only to him. This was my first introduction to Martin Nowak, who has a magnetic personality. I hijacked him from his former thesis advisor, and he wrote his thesis on the iterated prisoner's dilemma with me. He was not the only brilliant student I had, but he was the one who was the most mind-opening for me. He then went as a post doc to\nBob May\nin Oxford, and then he went to Princeton, and then to Harvard ... .\nLet us quote Martin Nowak's description of how their cooperation worked\n[\n5\n]\n:-\nOnce a year the theoretical chemist Peter Schuster used to take his students from the University of Vienna to a small house in the Austrian mountains. During the day we skied, of course, but in the evening the emphasis was on science. I was a first-year PhD student looking for a project. The mathematician Karl Sigmund was there and gave a talk on what was a new topic for him: the prisoner's dilemma. At the end of the talk I asked a question, and the next day we travelled back to Vienna, endlessly debating this game. In subsequent days, I visited Karl's office and we started to do calculations. We had become prisoners of the dilemma. We often met in coffee houses, the genius loci of past glory. Here\nKurt GÃ¶del\nannounced his incompleteness theorem,\nLudwig Boltzmann\nworked on entropy, and\nLudwig Wittgenstein\nchallenged the Vienna circle. Or we walked in the Vienna forest, visiting a meadow called 'Himmel'\n(\nHeaven\n)\n, where a sign noted that here Sigmund Freud first understood the nature of dreams. Within a year, we had conceived an evolutionary description of probabilistic strategies in the prisoner's dilemma struggling for cooperation by natural selection ...\nSigmund discussed the prisoner's dilemma and similar topics in his books\nEvolutionary Games and Population Dynamics\n(1998)\n,\nThe Calculus of Selfishness\n(2010)\n, and\nGames of Life: Explorations in Ecology, Evolution, and Behaviour\n(2017)\n. For information on these books and extracts from reviews, see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nLet us return to giving some details of Sigmund's career. In addition to his professorship at the University of Vienna, he became a part-time worker at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis in Laxenburg, Austria, in January\n1984\n. Laxenburg is only around\n20\nkm south of Vienna. At this Institute he worked in the Evolution and Ecology Program. His work includes game-theoretical modelling of animal behaviour, mathematical models in ecology and population dynamics, and stochastic and deterministic treatment of immunological processes. Sigmund was head of the Institute of Mathematics at The University of Vienna in\n1983\n-\n85\n. He was also much involved with the\nAustrian Mathematical Society\n, being its vice-president in\n1995\n-\n97\nand president\n1997\n-\n2001\n.\nWith such a range of interests, it is perhaps not entirely surprising that Sigmund should become interested in the history of science. His book\nExact Thinking in Demented Times: the Vienna Circle and the Epic Quest for the Foundations of Science\n(2017)\nhas been described as \"serious and first-rate history - written like a novel.\n[\nIt is\n]\na masterpiece.\" When asked how he became interested in the Vienna Circle, Sigmund replied\n[\n3\n]\n:-\n[\nMy interest\n]\nwas sparked by\nLudwig Wittgenstein\n, a philosopher of mathematics and language who fascinated me when I was a schoolboy. I got over that crush, but I still cannot make up my mind about his work or about him as a person - and when I found that the Vienna Circle had exactly the same problem with\nWittgenstein\n, I instantly felt drawn to them. Today the members of the circle are pigeonholed as \"logical empiricists,\" but that label does not do justice to their diversity, their internal and external fights, their turbocharged philosophical environment, and their dramatic individual fates. They were right in the middle of an amazing philosophical firework, one that sent Ernst Mach,\nLudwig Boltzmann\n, Karl Popper, and\nWittgenstein\nsoaring into the sky.\nIn the recent\n[\nOctober\n2018]\ninterview Sigmund explains his journey through the different areas on which he had done research and where his latest ideas are leading\n[\n4\n]\n:-\nRight now I'm in the middle of a big change in gear. I've been thinking for the last four or five years about the history and philosophy of science, including the Vienna Circle, the influence of Albert Einstein, etc. Now, I'm getting back to evolutionary game theory, the theory of evolution of cooperation and the social contract, and how the social contract can be subverted by corruption. That's what interests me most currently.Â Of course, that is not a new story. I believe it explains a lot of what I see happening in my field and in related fields. The ideas that survive are the ideas that are fruitful in the sense of quickly producing a lot of publications, and that's not necessarily correlated with these ideas being important to advancing science.\nLet us now look at some of the honours given to Sigmund. He gave the plenary lecture\nThe Population Dynamics of Conflict and Cooperation\nat the International Congress of Mathematicians held inÂ Berlin in August\n1998\n. He was elected a member of theÂ\nAustrian Academy of Science\nin\n1999\n, and a member of theÂ\nGerman Academy of Science\n(\nLeopoldina\n)\nin\n2003\n. He delivered theÂ\nGauss\nlectureÂ at the\nGerman Mathematical Society\nheld in WÃ¼rzburg in\n2003\n. He was declared Austrian of the yearÂ\n(\nresearch\n)\nÂ for\n2006\n.\nOn Monday,\n9\nApril\n2007\n, the Department of Applied Mathematics at the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago hosted the inaugural\nKarl Menger\nlectureÂ by Karl Sigmund on \"Menger, Games, and Morals.\"\nIn\n2010\nSigmund was elected a member of theÂ European Academy of Science and, in the same year, awarded an honorary doctorate by theÂ University of Helsinki. He received the Preis der Stadt Wien fÃ¼r Naturwissenschaften\nâ\n(\nCity of Vienna prize for natural sciences\n)\n, also in\n2010\n. He was awarded the WÃ¼rdigungspreis fÃ¼r Wissenschaften durch das Land NiederÃ¶sterreich\nâ\n(\nLower Austria prize for the appreciation of science\n)\nÂ in\n2011\nand, in the same year, the\nBlaise Pascal\nMedal for Mathematics of the European Academy of Science.\nHe was invited to give the Pacific Institute for Mathematical Sciences Distinguished Colloquium at the University of British Columbia on\n13\nApril\n2012\n.  He delivered the lecture\nSanctions on the Commons: Social Learning and the Social Contract\n. He gave the following Abstract:-\nEvolutionary game theory helps to investigate the role of incentives in promoting cooperative behaviour in joint enterprises. In particular, this lecture deals with the surprising effects of optional participation in collaborative enterprises. Coercion works better for voluntary rather than compulsory collaboration. A social contract need not be based on rational deliberation or the command of a higher authority. It can emerge spontaneously through social learning of individuals guided by no more than their myopic self-interest.\nAlso in\n2012\n, Sigmund received the Isaacs' Award of the International Society on Dynamic Games. On Tuesday,\n4\nJune\n2013\n, the University of Vienna presented the \"UNIVIE Teaching Award\n2013\n\" for outstanding teaching achievements to Karl Sigmund. A Symposium in honour of Sigmund was held at the University of Vienna in October\n2015\n. He received the Science Book of the Year Prize from the Austrian Federal Ministry of Science, Research and Economy in\n2016\nfor his book on the Vienna Circle."
