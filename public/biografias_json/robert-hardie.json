He then went to the University of Oxford and was awarded a B.A. in\n1888\n. Hardie then returned to Edinburgh where he was appointed as an Assistant in Logic and Metaphysics at the University in\n1889\n.\nHardie remained an assistant until\n1892\nwhen he was promoted to Lecturer in Logic and Metaphysics. Remaining at Edinburgh University he was again promoted, this time to Reader in Ancient Philosophy in\n1920\n. He remained in this post until he retired in\n1932\n.\nThe\nEdinburgh Mathematical Society\nwas founded in\n1883\nand Hardie joined the Society at its inaugural meeting in February of that year. At this time he gave his address as\n4\nScotland Street, Edinburgh. He appears to have left the\nEdinburgh Mathematical Society\nin\n1930\nbut joined again two years later after he retired. On Friday\n9\nMarch\n1923\na discussion on the teaching of elementary geometry was opened by Mr A J Tressland, M.A., F.R.S.E., of the Edinburgh Academy, who advocated the adoption of the sequence in geometrical teaching contained in the schedule recently issued by a special committee of the Assistant-Masters' Association. Hardie took part in the subsequent discussion."
