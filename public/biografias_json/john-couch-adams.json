  "biografia": "John Couch Adams\n's parents were Tabitha Knill Grylls and Thomas Adams. The family was a poor one with Thomas being a tenant farmer while Tabitha also came from a farming family. Thomas and Tabitha farmed near Launceston, Cornwall, and it was on Lidcott farm that John, the eldest of his parents seven children, was born. John Couch Adams was named after his mother's uncle, John Couch. It is particularly fitting that this should be the case since John Couch provided some education for Tabitha who inherited his library which included several astronomy books. It was this library, particularly the astronomy books in it, which fired John's interest as he grew up. Hutchins writes\n[\n3\n]\n:-\nAdams was brought up in a close Wesleyan family and had his mother's good ear and love of music.\nJohn attended the nearby village school at Laneast, where he studied Greek and algebra, until he was twelve years old when he went to a private school at Devonport run by his cousin the Revd John Couch Grylls. He also attended schools at Saltash and Landulph. At the Devonport school he continued his studies of classics, showed great mathematical ability and became known for his considerable abilities for accurate numerical calculations. It was during this period that he first became interested in astronomy and in\n1835\n, while at Landulph, he observed\nHalley\n's comet. He worked out that an\nannular eclipse\nof the Sun would be visible in Lidcot in\n1836\n, and he was there to make the observations. His mathematical skills were, however, self-taught for he learnt little of the topic at school. He would go to the Devonport Mechanics' Institute where he looked up articles on mathematics and astronomy.\nAdams was educated at St John's College, Cambridge but this was only made possible by a number of fortuitous circumstances. His mother received a small inheritance in\n1836\n, Adams earned money as a tutor in\n1837\n, and he then won a scholarship to St John's College. These sources of money made a university education for him possible but financially difficult. He began his undergraduate mathematics course in October\n1839\nand graduated as\nSenior Wrangler\n(\nranked top of the First Class\n)\nfour years later having, rather remarkably, won the first prize in Greek testament every year. In the Mathematical Tripos examinations of\n1843\nhe is said to have been awarded double the marks of the Second Wrangler which, if true, is an incredible achievement. Also in\n1843\nhe became first Smith's Prizeman and he became a Fellow of St John's College. He did not spend all his time on research, however, for he tutored undergraduates so that he might earn money to send home to help with his brother's education. We should note that of his three brothers, Thomas Adams became a missionary, George Adams became a farmer, while William Grylls Adams became professor of natural philosophy and astronomy at King's College, London, and was elected a Fellow of the\nRoyal Society\n.\nOn\n3\nJuly\n1841\n, while still an undergraduate, Adams made a note that he had decided to investigate:-\n... the irregularities of the motion of Uranus...in order to find out whether they may be attributed to the action of an undiscovered planet beyond it.\nIn September\n1845\nAdams gave accurate information on the position of the new planet to James Challis, director of the Cambridge Observatory. Challis gave Adams a letter of introduction to\nAiry\n, the Astronomer Royal at Greenwich. Adams twice called at Greenwich during October attempting to see\nAiry\n, but he had not made an appointment and was unsuccessful. He did leave the data giving his predicted position which\nAiry\nreceived and sent a letter to Adams with what he considered a vital question. Adams felt that\nAiry\n's question was trivial and so did not reply. Action was not taken by the Cambridge Observatory. Sampson writes\n[\n6\n]\n:-\nAdams told nobody, neither did Challis, neither did\nAiry\n.\nGlaisher\n, in\n[\n9\n]\n, reports that Adams said that he expected\nAiry\nwould have:-\n... communicated my results among his correspondents.\nGlaisher\nconcludes\n[\n9\n]\n:-\nAs professor in the University\n[\nChallis\n]\nshould not have allowed a young Senior Wrangler, through modesty or diffidence or inexperience, to do such injustice to himself.\nIn November\n1845\nAdams was elected a Fellow of the\nRoyal Astronomical Society\n, not on the strength of his predictions for the new planet which remained unknown, but rather for his paper\nElements of the comet Faye\nin which, Challis reported:-\n...\n[\nAdams\n]\nsuggests that the comet may, perhaps, not have been moving long in its present orbit, and that, as in the case of the comet of\n1770\n, we are indebted to the action of Jupiter for its present apparition.\nUrbain Le Verrier\n's prediction was published in June\n1846\nwhile Adams' prediction was still only known to Challis and\nAiry\n. Despite this published prediction being close to that of Adams, he still made no claim regarding his precedence. Strangely,\nAiry\nwrote to\nLe Verrier\nwith the same question he had posed to Adams, but still did not mention Adams' prediction\n(\nin fact Adams' name was not mentioned\n)\n. It was\nLe Verrier\n's prediction which led to the discovery of Neptune on\n23\nSeptember\n1846\nby Galle at the Berlin Observatory.\nHutchins writes in\n[\n3\n]\n:-\nAdams was lionized in his university, perceived as having the most imaginative English mathematical mind and power of calculation since\nNewton\n. He never uttered a word against Challis or\nAiry\n, and that reticence and his genial nature endeared him to many.\nThe\nRoyal Astronomical Society\nwas in a difficult position over Adams and\nLe Verrier\n. At its meeting on\n14\nNovember\n1846\n, as well as communications from\nAiry\nand Challis explaining their actions regarding Adams' prediction, a paper from Adams was read entitled\nExplanation of the observed irregularities in the motion of Uranus\n. Sampson writes in\n[\n6\n]\n:-\nThere is not a phrase of complaint, bitterness, or regret. There is hardly a personal word at all. except one generous passage conceding the whole glory to\nLe Verrier\n.\nAdams attended the meeting in person and is said to have\n[\n6\n]\n:-\n... behaved like a bashful boy.\nHis paper was published in January\n1847\n. You can read this paper at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nHowever following this the\nRoyal Astronomical Society\nplunged itself into the impossible question of who should receive their Gold Medal. Their rules only allowed one medal to be awarded so after many arguments neither received a Gold Medal for the discovery of Neptune. Adams was, however, awarded the Gold Medal in\n1866\nfor his work on the lunar perigee and acceleration.\nIn\n1852\nAdam's fellowship at St John's College ended so he effectively became unemployed although he continued his research. However in February\n1853\nhe was elected to a fellowship at Pembroke College, Cambridge, and resumed teaching. He was to hold this Fellowship, in addition to other posts, until his death. Adams became Regius Professor of Mathematics at St Andrews in October\n1857\n. It was a short tenure of the chair for, in March\n1859\n, he succeeded\nPeacock\nas Lowndean Professor of Astronomy and Geometry at Cambridge and held the post for over\n32\nyears. He became director of the Cambridge Observatory in\n1861\nbut negotiated rather unusual conditions for his appointment. The Observatory was poorly funded and Challis had tried hard to obtain support for it. Eventually, in December\n1858\n, Challis arranged with Anne Sheepshanks that she make a donation in memory of her brother. Challis and\nStokes\napproached Adams to take on the directorship in place of Challis who wished to leave the post. Adams was interested in theoretical work, not in observing, so he made conditions that he would not have to observe or process data. He could resign the position if he found that the work in any way interfered with his research. All this was possible since the Sheepshanks donation enabled a senior assistant to be employed to undertake observational work.\nIn October\n1862\nAdams met Elizabeth Bruce, from Dublin, who was a friend of\nStokes\n's wife. They met again in December when Adams went to Ireland to offer the senior assistant position to Andrew Graham, director of Markree observatory. Adams proposed marriage to Elizabeth and they were married on\n2\nMay\n1863\n.\nAdams's made many other contributions to astronomy, notably his studies of the Leonid meteor shower. He predicted correctly in\n1864\nthat the meteor shower would occur in November\n1866\n. Calculating the orbit was an extremely difficult task since the effect of planetary perturbations had to be taken into account. In March\n1867\nhe showed that the orbit of the meteor shower was very similar to that of Tempel's comet. He was able to correctly conclude that the meteor shower was associated with that comet. Newall writes in\n[\n6\n]\n:-\nAnd thus was established the close relation between comets and meteors.\nAdams spent much effort on the complex problem of a description of the motion of the Moon, giving a theory which was more accurate than that of\nLaplace\n. He began this work in\n1851\nwhen elected as President of the\nRoyal Astronomical Society\nand he presented a paper to the\nRoyal Society\nin\n1853\nin which he showed that\nLaplace\nhad omitted terms from his equations which were not negligible. His corrections to\nLaplace\n's work reduced by half the discrepancy between the observed orbit and the predicted one. The error is now known to be due to the tidal drag of the moon on the Earth which is slowing down the Earth's rotation. It is fair to say that the French were not pleased to see Adams correcting\nLaplace\n, particularly since they had reacted angrily a few years earlier when they saw him as attempting to detract from\nLe Verrier\n's glory.\nAdams also studied terrestrial magnetism, determined the Gaussian magnetic constants at every point on the Earth and produced maps with contour lines of equal magnetic variation which were published after his death. He also gave tables of the positions of the moons of Jupiter, spent much time on a catalogue of\nNewton\n's papers, and calculated\nEuler\n's constant to\n236\ndecimal places. In all he wrote about\n50\npapers, of which eleven were on pure mathematics, but it was his passion for perfection which prevented him publishing much more.\nGlaisher\nwrites\n[\n9\n]\n:-\nFor forty-five years his\n[\npowerful\n]\nmind was constantly directed to mathematical research relating principally to astronomy\n[\nbut because of his\n]\ninnate craving for perfection\n[\nhe published little\n]\n.\nAdams will be best remembered, however, for his role as the co-discoverer of Neptune. We return to this topic now since the difference between his role in that discovery and that of\nLe Verrier\nis more clearly understood when Adams's character is studied. A fellow undergraduate at Cambridge could hardly remember Adams and described him as:-\nA rather small man, who walked quickly, and wore a faded coat of dark green.\nAlways meticulous, Adams had a reputation for constructing mathematical questions for his students which were admired by all for their beauty\n(\nexcept perhaps the students being examined!\n)\n. He was a man of great learning studying history, literature, biology and geology. He had a keen interest in politics and he was so affected by the Franco-Prussian war that, according to\n[\n11\n]\n:-\n... he could scarcely work or sleep.\nHe never boasted of his achievements and in fact he refused a knighthood which was offered to him in\n1847\n. He did, however, accept honorary degrees from Oxford, Dublin, Edinburgh, and Bologna. He was elected to the\nRoyal Society\n, the\nSt Petersburg Academy\n, and to the\nAcademy of Sciences\n.\nAfter the discovery of Neptune, Adams first met\nLe Verrier\nin Oxford in June\n1847\n. According to\n[\n9\n]\n:-\nHe uttered no complaint, he laid no claim to priority,\nLe Verrier\nhad no warmer admirer.\nIn\n1868\nLe Verrier\nwas presented with the Gold Medal of the\nRoyal Astronomical Society\nfor his theories of Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars. Adams, as President of the Society, gave the address when\nLe Verrier\nreceived the Gold Medal again in\n1876\nfor his theories of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. However, on this occasion,\nLe Verrier\nwas ill and could not attend in person.\nAdams' interests outside science are described by Hutchins\n[\n3\n]\n:-\nAdams was happily married, profoundly devout, and enjoyed social visits, house guests, entertaining, music, dancing, parties, long daily walks, croquet, bowls, and whist. He shared contemporary interests in mesmerism and the occult. A bibliophile, when not socializing in the evenings he read. He attended the weekly meetings of The Family, a university dining club, at least from\n1860\nto\n1889\n. He was much involved in college and university business.\nIn October\n1889\nAdams became seriously ill with a stomach haemorrhage. He recovered but the illness recurred and this cycle repeated itself several times until June\n1891\n. From this time on it was clear that no recovery would occur. He died in the Cambridge Observatory.\nThe portrait above was taken when he was in St Andrews by the pioneer photographer John Adamson."
