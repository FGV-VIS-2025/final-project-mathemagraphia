  "biografia": "Gilberto Francisco Loibel\nwas the son of Franz Loibel and Gertrud Loibel Reyar who were both chemical engineers. Franz Loibel, born in Germany on\n30\nJuly\n1891\n, married Gertrud Reyar, born in Germany in about\n1894\n. They worked in Magdeburg, Germany where their first child Gerda Angelica Loibel was born on\n13\nJanuary\n1928\n. Maria Aparecida Sores Ruas writes\n[\n11\n]\n:-\nGilberto Francisco Loibel was the son of Franz Loibel and Gertrudes Loibel Reyar, German chemical engineers who came to SÃ£o Paulo in\n1929\n, during the crisis in Europe. His only sister, Angelica, was born in Germany a few years earlier. The family returned to Germany in\n1939\n, shortly before the outbreak of World War II, which took place in September of the same year. The family returned to Brazil in\n1947\n.\nIn fact Dr Gertrud Loibel\n(\nage\n36)\nand Gerda Angelica Loibel\n(\nage\n2)\nsailed from Hamburg, Germany, to Brazil on the ship General Osorio leaving on\n3\nApril\n1930\n. They give their final destination as Santos, SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. Dr Franz Loibel had travelled to Santos, SÃ£o Paulo, before his wife and daughter. He sailed from Hamburg to Brazil, with final destination Santos, SÃ£o Paulo, on the ship the\nAntonio Delfino\nleaving Hamburg on\n22\nAugust\n1929\n. After the family spent the years of World War II in Germany, Franz Loibel and Gerda Angelica Loibel returned from Germany to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil arriving on\n27\nMay\n1948\n. We have not found the dates on which Gertrud and Gilberto returned to Brazil from Germany after the end of World War II but assume they travelled around a couple of months after Franz and Gerda.\nGilberto's primary education was in Germany and he also began his secondary education there. This was during World War II when conditions were extremely difficult. After the family returned to Brazil in\n1948\n, he attended the Instituto de EducaÃ§Ã£o in JundiaÃ­, SÃ£o Paulo. This school began as an independent school in around\n1930\nbut became a State school in September\n1945\n. When Gilberto attended, it was actually named ColÃ©gio Estadual e Escola Normal of JundiaÃ­, only adopting the name Instituto de EducaÃ§Ã£o in\n1953\n.\nWhile at this college, Loibel met Izette Alves Coelho; they became close friends and later married. Coelho had been born in Botucatu, Brazil on\n18\nDecember\n1932\n. Loibel completed his studies at the college in\n1951\nand, in the following year, he was ranked first in the entrance examination for the bachelor's degree in Mathematics at the Faculty of Philosophy, Sciences and Letters of the University of SÃ£o Paulo. Let us give a little background to the Department of Mathematics at the University of SÃ£o Paulo.\nThe University of SÃ£o Paulo was founded inÂ\n1934\nÂ and professors were brought to SÃ£o Paulo from France, Italy and Germany. The first mathematics professor that was brought was\nLuigi FantappiÃ¨\nwho travelled to Brazil from Italy in\n1933\n.\nCÃ¢ndido Silva Dias\nbegan studying mathematics at the Polytechnic School in\n1932\nand became one of\nFantappiÃ¨\n's first students. In\n1934\nOmar Catunda\nwas appointed as\nFantappiÃ¨\n's assistant and they collaborated on starting up the Mathematics Subsection of the Faculty of Philosophy, Sciences and Letters at the University of SÃ£o Paulo with\nFantappiÃ¨\nas its head. It later became the Institute of Mathematics and Statistics.\nCÃ¢ndido Silva Dias\nwas appointed as\nFantappiÃ¨\n's assistant in\n1937\nand taught in the Mathematics Department for\n54\nyears retiring in\n1990\n. In\n1945\nElza Furtado Gomide\nbecame\nCatunda\n's assistant and, a couple of years later, she took over teaching\nCatunda\n's Mathematical Analysis course. One of the students taking this course was\nCarlos Benjamin de Lyra\n, who was an undergraduate between\n1946\nand\n1950\n.\nLuiz Henrique Jacy Monteiro\nwas also an important figure, having been an undergraduate at the University of SÃ£o Paulo, then awarded his doctorate by university in\n1951\n, and\nLeopoldo Nachbin\n, although in the Department of Physics at SÃ£o Paulo at this time, was another outstanding mathematician.\nWhile studying mathematics at the University of SÃ£o Paulo, Loibel was taught by\nOmar Catunda\n,\nElza Gomide\nand\nCÃ¢ndido Silva Dias\namong others. He graduated from the Faculdade de Filosofia, CiÃªncias e Letras of SÃ£o Paulo with a bachelor's degree in Mathematics in\n1955\n. In August\n1956\nhe was appointed as an Instructor in Geometry at the Department of Mathematics of the School of Engineering of SÃ£o Carlos, University of SÃ£o Paulo. Occupying the Chair of Geometry at SÃ£o Carlos was combinatorial topologist Achille Bassi who was\n[\n8\n]\n:-\n... born in Italy, and arrived in Brazil in\n1939\nat the invitation of the Brazilian government to teach at the National Faculty of Philosophy, part of the University of Brazil, located in Rio de Janeiro. He went through other Brazilian educational institutions until, in\n1953\n, he received an invitation to organise the Department of Mathematics at the School of Engineering of SÃ£o Carlos, University of SÃ£o Paulo. In this institution, he also taught, and supervised undergraduate and graduate students ...\nWe obtain more information about the Department of Mathematics at SÃ£o Carlos from\n[\n5\n]\n:-\nThe organisation of the Department of Mathematics was under the responsibility of Professor Achille Bassi, who endeavoured to acquire a bibliographic collection and hire qualified researchers to form a research centre in Mathematics. In this way, the Department was created with post-graduate courses. Professor Achille Bassi's determination to create an excellent library gave rise to one of the best libraries in the country in the area of  Mathematics ... The Department of Mathematics was then formed by professors Achille Bassi, JaurÃ©z Cecconi and Ubaldo Richard and some engineers who came from the Polytechnic School on a part-time basis ... Professor Jaurez Cecconi was an analyst. His research papers on Calculus of Variations and Optimisation were published between\n1951\nand\n1985\n, mainly in Italian journals. Professor Ubaldo Richard was also an analyst. His research papers on Differential Equations and Integral Equations were published between\n1940\nand\n1982\n, mainly in Italian journals.\nLoibel began undertaking research for a Ph.D., advised by Achille Bassi and took postgraduate courses taught by Bassi, JaurÃ©z Cecconi and Ubaldo Richard. He also regularly attended postgraduate seminars run by\nCarlos Benjamin de Lyra\n, at the Faculty of Philosophy, Sciences and Letters at the University of SÃ£o Paulo and attended the Algebraic Geometry Seminars at the same institution run by\nLuiz HenriqueÂ Jacy Monteiro\n. During this period, Loibel  married Izette Alves Coelho in\n1958\n. She became a mathematician writing the Master's Thesis\nCurvas planas e aplicaÃ§Ãµes excelentes\nâ\n(\nFlat curves and optimum applications\n)\nin\n1970\nwhich she submitted to the Universidade de SÃ£o Paulo, SÃ£o Carlos. Gilberto and Izette Loibel had several children including Selene Maria Coelho Loibel. Selene wrote the Master's thesis\nUso de mÃ©todos Bayesianos para modelos com pontos de mudanÃ§a\nâ\n(\nUsing Bayesian methods for models with change points\n)\nin\n1998\n. She dedicates the thesis \"To my parents, Izette and Gilberto and to my son Diog.\" She became a professor of statistics at the Universidade Estadual Paulista.\nIn\n1959\nLoibel was awarded a doctorate for his thesis\nSobre Quase Grupos TopolÃ³gicos e EspaÃ§os com MultiplicaÃ§Ã£o\nâ\n(\nOn almost topological groups and spaces with multiplication\n)\n. In fact he had published the paper\nSobre Quase Grupos TopolÃ³gicos\nâ\n(\nOn topological quasi-groups\n)\nin\n1958\nwhich consisted of the first three chapters of his thesis. Reviewing this paper, Federico Sioson writes\n[\n12\n]\n:-\nThis paper constitutes the first three of the four chapters of the author's doctoral thesis. The first of these is an exposition of well-known results in\n(\nalgebraic\n)\nquasi-groups ... A quasi-group with a multiplicative identity is a loop. The remaining two chapters are devoted to a development of certain fundamental notions, adaptations from topological groups, for topological quasi-groups. A topological quasi-group\n[\nloop\n]\nis a quasi-group\n[\nloop\n]\nendowed with a topology under which its operations are continuous; or what amounts to the same thing, a topological space which admits a compatible quasi-group\n[\nloop\n]\nstructure. ... The main theorems of the second chapter include\n(1)\nthe observation that a topological space which admits a quasi-group structure also admits a loop structure,\n(2)\na characterisation of the notion of a fundamental system of neighbourhoods of the identity of a\nHausdorff\nloop,\n(3)\na homomorphism theorem for topological loops, and\n(4)\na necessary condition for two topological loops to be locally isomorphic.\nAlso in\n1959\nhe published the paper\nMultiplications on products of spheres\n.\nJ Frank Adams\nwrites\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nThe author studies continuous multiplications with identity defined on a Cartesian product of spheres. He determines when such multiplications exist; when they exist, he classifies them in terms of homotopy groups of spheres. He then states, for example, that a homotopy-commutative product can exist only on a product of circles.\nIn\n1960\nLoibel was promoted to Assistant to the Chair of Geometry at SÃ£o Carlos. He was awarded a CAPES scholarship to support a postdoctoral internship at the University of California, Berkeley, USA. CAPES is a Foundation within the Ministry of Education in Brazil whose central purpose is to coordinate efforts to improve the quality of Brazil's faculty and staff in higher education through grant programmes. CAPES is particularly concerned with the training of doctoral and postdoctoral candidates. Loibel and his wife left SÃ£o Paulo and arrived in New York on\n25\nSeptember\n1960\non their way to Berkeley.\nLoibel's host at Berkeley was\nEdwin Spanier\nwho had been appointed to Berkeley one year earlier and had begun building up a strong group working in geometry and topology by several appointments of topologists. During the visit, Loibel had contact with leading topologists and geometers. He attended Topology Seminars, in conjunction with Stanford University, took a Differential Geometry course given by\nShiing-shen Chern\nand a 'Stratified Sets' course given by\nRenÃ© Thom\n. Loibel remained in Berkeley until\n1962\nwhen he returned to Brazil and was promoted to Regent Professor in the Department of Mathematics in the SÃ£o Carlos School of Engineering and became Head of Mathematics. He organised a Topology Seminar in the Department which studied topics such as the Theory of Homotopy and Fibres according to\nJean-Pierre Serre\n, Multilinear Algebra and Differentiable Manifolds, and Cellular Complexes. He also set up a research group on Singularities in his department.\nIn\n1962\nhe published\nÃber topologische LÃ¶sungssysteme\nâ\n(\nOn topological solution systems\n)\n. Karl Heinrich Hofmann writes in the review\n[\n6\n]\n:-\nThe systems mentioned in the title are topological spaces with a continuous multiplication with left unit such that the equationÂ xa = bÂ is continuously uniquely solvable forÂ x. Some general\n(\nand, on the whole, superficial\n)\nfeatures of topological group theory carry over to these structures, e.g., the standard statements about substructures, continuous and open homomorphisms, separation properties, and connectivity.\n(\nFor example, the closure of a subsystem is a subsystem. Open subsystems are closed. Connected systems are generated by each neighbourhood of the left unit, etc.\n)\nA useful observation\n(\neven in the case of groups\n)\nis this: If a systemÂ SÂ is such that every\n1\n-\n1\ncontinuous map ofÂ\nS\nÃ\nS\nS \\times  S\nS\nÃ\nS\nÂ onto itself is a homeomorphism, then the continuity of multiplication implies the continuity of the solution, and conversely\n(\nthe condition is satisfied ifÂ SÂ is compact or is a manifold\n)\n. A general notion of uniformity is introduced to fit the purpose of invariantly uniformising a system. Most of the results in the theory of covering structures are flexible enough to hold for the systems considered. However, an example is given of a system on the\n2\n-torus which is covered by a system on the plane but is not covered by any system on the cylinder.\nIn\n1965\nLoibel ended his time as Head of Mathematics and from October\n1965\nto July\n1966\nhe was a Visiting Professor at the Universidad Central de Venezuela. There he supervised the work of two students working for the equivalent of a Master's Degree.\nBefore going to Venezuela he attended the Fifth Brazilian Mathematics Colloquium was held from\n4\n-\n24\nJuly\n1965\nin the city of PoÃ§os de Caldas. The coordinator of the Colloquium was\nLuiz Henrique Jacy Monteiro\n, two postgraduate courses were given, and five advanced courses were given including 'Obstruction Theory' by\nEdwin Spanier\nand 'Diophantine Approximation' by\nSerge Lang\n. The Sixth Brazilian Mathematics Colloquium was held from\n2\n-\n22\nJuly\n1967\n, also in the city of PoÃ§os de Caldas, and again the coordinator of the Colloquium was\nLuiz Henrique Jacy Monteiro\n. Loibel gave a postgraduate course on 'Singularities' and postdoctoral courses were given by\nLeopoldo Nachbin\nand\nIsrael Herstein\n. The Seventh Brazilian Mathematics Colloquium,\n6\n-\n26\nJuly\n1969\n, was again held in PoÃ§os de Calda. Loibel was the coordinator of this Colloquium and among courses given we mention 'Fundamental Group and Covering' by\nCarlos Benjamin de Lyra\n, 'Galois Theory' by\nJacy Monteiro\nand 'Invariant Subspaces' by\nPaul Halmos\n. During this Colloquium, the\nBrazilian Mathematical Society\nwas founded. The meeting to found the Society was attended by\n162\nmathematicians and was chaired by Loibel. The course on Singularities that Loibel taught at the Sixth Brazilian Mathematics Colloquium in\n1967\nwas written up as the book\nSingularidades das aplicaÃ§Ãµes diferenciÃ¡veis\nâ\n(\nSingularities of differentiable applications\n)\nand published by the Instituto Nacional de MatemÃ¡tica Pura e Aplicada\n(\nIMPA\n)\n.\nAs we saw above, the Mathematics Department of the University of SÃ£o Paulo at SÃ£o Carlos had been set up in\n1953\nby Achille Bassi as part of the SÃ£o Carlos Engineering School. Loibel had worked in that Department from\n1956\nbut there were problems caused by the fact that it was part of an engineering school. Loibel said\n[\n3\n]\n:-\n... we were suffocated inside the SÃ£o Carlos School of Engineering, obviously because the important thing was engineering. Mathematics and numerical analysis were in the background, they were suffocated inside. The issue was not only related to funding for staff and laboratories, but also for the library.\nFor further details of this interview, see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nIn\n1970\nthe Computational Science and Statistics Department was set up, also in the SÃ£o Carlos School of Engineering, but in\n1971\nthe Mathematical Science Institute of SÃ£o Carlos\n(\nICMC\n)\nwas founded by joining together the Mathematics Department and the Computation Science and Statistics Department, making them independent of the Engineering School. Maria Aparecida Sores Ruas, a professor at the University of SÃ£o Paulo who had been a student of Loibel's, wrote\n[\n11\n]\n:-\nTogether with a small group of pioneering professors, Loibel played a fundamental role in the creation and consolidation of the then Institute of Mathematical Sciences of SÃ£o Carlos.\nThere had been different views on the creation of the Institute\n[\n8\n]\n:-\nAccording to Gilberto Francisco Loibel, at that time there were groups of professors who sympathised with various different positions regarding the creation of an Institute. Some of them, including Professor Loibel, defended the idea of bringing together the Basic Sciences in a single Institute separate from the Engineering School. However, this was not the position that the head of the Mathematics Department defended, as he was thinking of creating an Institute solely for his area.\nRuas gave further details of Loibel's contributions in\n[\n9\n]\n. She said that:-\n... in addition to being the person who introduced the Theory of Singularities in Brazil, Loibel was the founder of the Grupo de Singularidades de SÃ£o Carlos. He supervised the first master's and doctoral students in this area, mainly from\n1970\nto\n1985\n. Many of the dissertations and theses supervised by Loibel were pioneers in the topics covered, thanks to the supervisor's brilliance. He was one of the most brilliant mathematicians I ever met ...\nOn\n11\nJanuary\n1971\nLoibel was elected to the\nBrazilian Academy of Sciences\n. From\n1971\nto\n1976\n, Loibel coordinated the Graduate Programme in Mathematics at SÃ£o Carlo. He became a full professor at the ICMC in\n1981\ndefending his thesis\nL-EquivalÃªncia e Bordismo Ambiental de Subvariedades\nâ\n(\nL-equivalence and environmental bordism of subvarieties\n)\non\n4\nSeptember\n1981\n. He was a founding member of the Academia de CiÃªncias do Estado de SÃ£o Paulo\n(\nACIESP\n)\nwhen it was founded on\n8\nOctober\n1974\n. This Academy organises scientific meetings, publishes books and proceedings of meetings, supports the Mathematical Olympiads, and supports students through scholarships. In this Academy he was elected several times as a representative of the Mathematics area on its Board of Directors and was Regional Director of ACIESP in the city of SÃ£o Carlos. He was regional coordinator of the\n1\nst Brazilian Mathematics Olympiad and\n2\nnd Brazilian Mathematics Olympiad which took place in\n1979\nand\n1980\n. He was vice-director of the ICMC from\n1982\nto\n1986\n. He was also coordinator, in\n1988\n, of the\n11\nth Mathematics Olympiad of the State of SÃ£o Paulo, an event that was sponsored by the ACIESP. He retired from the ICMC in SÃ£o Carlos in\n1987\n.\nAfter retiring from SÃ£o Carlos, he was a professor at the Institute of Geosciences and Exact Sciences at the Rio Claro campus of the University of SÃ£o Paulo from\n1987\nto\n2002\n.\nThe Federal Institute of Mato Grosso do Sul has its main campus in Campo Grande and nine other campuses, one of which is in Coxim. On\n9\n-\n10\nApril\n2013\na Mathematics Colloquium was held which was open to the community. The lecture \"What does a mathematician do?\" was given by Gilberto Francisco Loibel while the final talk about the outlook for young researchers in mathematics was given by his wife Izette Alves Coelho Loibel\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nThe sum of the couple's experience, is a career of seventy years.Â Gilberto even presided over the founding meeting of the\nBrazilian Society of Mathematics\n, in\n1969\n, and is a founding member of the Academy of Sciences of the State of SÃ£o Paulo.Â The two were part of the construction process for research in the city of SÃ£o Carlos, in the interior of SÃ£o Paulo.Â \"In addition to promoting and encouraging academic activity in Coxim, the colloquium aims to share the experience of the two speakers on how to create an academic culture for a city,\" emphasises Professor Tadeu CÃ¢ndido, coordinator of the event.\nOne year after Loibel died, the ICMC inaugurated a space in his honour\n[\n7\n]\n:-\nThe Institute of Mathematics and Computer Sciences\n(\nICMC\n)\nof the University of SÃ£o Paulo, in SÃ£o Carlos, inaugurated the Professor Loibel hyperspace on\n20\nNovember\n2014\n, located in the opening of the Achille Bassi Library. The tribute took place one year after the death of Professor Gilberto Francisco Loibel, one of the main drivers of the study and research environment in mathematics in the interior of the State of SÃ£o Paulo."
