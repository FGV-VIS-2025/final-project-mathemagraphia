  "biografia": "Marie FranÃ§oise Ouedraogo\nattended the LycÃ©e Municipale VÃ©nÃ©grÃ© in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. In the interview\n[\n3\n]\nshe said:-\nSince primary and secondary school, I have been very interested in mathematics and I had good marks without too much effort. So, it was natural for me to continue ... and stay in the area of mathematics.\nShe also acknowledged, in her thesis, the help of her uncle Georges Zangreyanogo with her schooling:-\nTo my uncle Georges Zangreyanogo who helped and supported me throughout my schooling.\nOuedraogo studied mathematics at the University of Ouagadougou and wrote her first thesis, the Doctorat de\n3\nÃ¨me cycle, advised by Akry Koulibaly. This thesis,\nSur les superalgÃ¨bres de Lie\n, submitted to the FacultÃ© des Sciences et Techniques of the University of Ouagadougou on\n22\nMarch\n1999\n, was examined by the jury:\nPresident: Albert OuÃ©draogo, professor at the University of Ouagadougou.\nMembers: Daouda SangarÃ©, professor at the University of Caen;\nArky Koulibaly, professor at the University of Ouagadougou;\nEdmond Fedida, professor at the University of Abidjan-Cocody;\nMoussa Ouattara, assistant professor at the University of Ouagadougou.\nOuedraogo dedicated her thesis with these words:-\nTo my family who spared no effort for my success in studies up to this level. To my uncle Georges Zangreyanogo who helped and supported me throughout my schooling. To the memory of my brother Victor.\nShe also has a list of \"Thanks\":-\nMy sincere thanks to Professor Albert OuÃ©draogo who kindly presided over the jury. We warmly thank Professor Daouda SangarÃ© for having accepted being a referee of our work and being a member of the jury. To Professor Akry Koulibaly who has supervised this work with great patience, competence and most of all advice, we simply say thank you, unable to find better ways to express our deep gratitude, as well as to Madame Koulibaly for her encouragement and her many advices. Our thanks are addressed equally to all the professors at the Faculty of Science, to my fellow students, for their advice, their encouragement and their constructive criticisms and to all those who in one way or another have supported this work.\nHere is Ouedraogo's Abstract of the thesis:-\nWe bring in this thesis our modest contribution to the study of\nLie\ntriple superalgebras. It is subdivided into three chapters. The first chapter recalls the definitions and properties known about superalgebras and\nMalcev\nsuperalgebras. In the second chapter, after having given the definitions of the notion of\nLie\ntriple superalgebras and of\nLie\ntriple supersystems, we study the weak super-representation of a\nMalcev\nsuperalgebra. We show that a\nMalcev\nsuper-representation is a weak super-representation, we give a condition for a weak super-representation to be a\nMalcev\nsuper-representation and we establish the cohomology groups related to the weak super-representation. In the third chapter, we define the notion of a projective relation between\nLie\ntriple superalgebras. We study the family of\nLie\nsuperalgebras of projectivity of a\nLie\ntriple superalgebra. We show that a\nLie\nsuperalgebra admits a family of\nLie\nsuperalgebras of projectivity and we give a condition that a\nLie\ntriple superalgebra is in projective relation with a triple\nLie\nsuper-system.\nOuedraogo published two papers in\n2002\n, both related to her thesis and written jointly with her thesis advisor Arky Koulibaly. These are\nSuper-reprÃ©sentations faibles de superalgÃ¨bres de Malcev\nâ\n(\nSuper representations of Malcev superalgebras\n)\nand\nSupersystÃ¨mes triples de Lie associÃ©s aux superalgÃ¨bres de Malcev\nâ\n(\nTriple Lie supersystems associated with Malcev superalgebras\n)\n.\nIn\n2005\nOuedraogo took on a political role when she became the Burkina Faso Permanent Secretary of the National Policy of Good Governance. This role came about since, in\n1998\n, Burkina Faso adopted its first good governance plan followed by its National Policy of Good Governance in\n2005\n. A Permanent Secretary was required in order to monitor, evaluate and stimulate the implementation of the\n2005\nPolicy. Reference\n[\n4\n]\nis an interview with Ouedraogo seeking her views on Good Governance which she described as follows\n[\n4\n]\n:-\nGood governance is generally accepted as the exercise of political, economic and administrative authority to manage the affairs of a State at all levels, with the participation of citizens through the framework of their expression. There are four areas of governance, namely: political governance, including security and human rights, administrative governance, economic governance and local governance.\nShe also spoke about the problem of corruption in Burkina Faso\n[\n4\n]\n:-\nCorruption has spread to all sectors of the economy of our country, including transport. However, hope is allowed since the highest authorities have for major concern to work to eradicate it. ... We must track down corruption wherever it occurs. ... We are waiting for proposals for relevant solutions in the direction of eradicating corruption to guide policy makers.\nDuring her time as Permanent Secretary of the National Policy of Good Governance she did not give up mathematics and in January\n2007\n, jointly with Sylvie Paycha, she submitted the paper\nThe Campbell-Hausdorff formula for pseudo-differential operators revisited. Applications to determinants\n. The Abstract of the paper is as follows:-\nWe extend\nOkikiolu\n's\nCampbell\n-\nHausdorff\nformula for pseudo-differential operators to operators with non scalar leading symbol. For this we introduce conditioned traces for which we provide explicit formulae. This\nCampbell\n-\nHausdorff\nformula is then applied to extend known local formulae for the multiplicative anomaly of zeta- and other regularised determinants.\nIn\n2008\nOuedraogo left the Good Governance role and devoted herself totally to mathematical research. Advised by Sylvie Paycha of the\nBlaise Pascal\nUniversity of Clermont-Ferrand and Arky Koulibaly of the University of Ouagadougou, her thesis\nExtension of the canonical trace and associated determinants\nÂ was accepted for a Ph.D. by the\nBlaise Pascal\nUniversity of Clermont-Ferrand in France after she defended it in October\n2009\n. The Abstract is as follows:-\nThis thesis is devoted to the study of the canonical trace and two types of determinants: on the one hand a determinant associated with the canonical trace on a class of pseudodifferential operators and on the other hand determinants associated with regularized traces. In the first part, in odd dimension, we revisit the uniqueness of the canonical trace on the space of classical pseudodifferential operators of odd class before extending it to log-polyhomogeneous operators of odd class. We classify the traces on the algebra of classical pseudodifferential operators of odd class and order zero. In the second part, we establish the locality of the multiplicative anomaly of the weighted determinant and the zeta determinant. These results are obtained thanks to the study of the locality of the weighted trace of the operator L\n(\nA;B\n)\n. We then derive from these results the local expression of the multiplicative anomalies in terms of the noncommutative residue. In the third part, we classify multiplicative determinants on the grounds of the classification of traces on classical pseudodifferential operators of odd class and order zero in odd dimension. We also define the symmetrized determinant obtained from the canonical trace applied to the symmetrized logarithm of an odd class operator in odd dimension. We show the multiplicativy of this determinant under some restrictions on the spectral cuts of the operators.\nOuedraogo was appointed as an assistant professor at the University of Ouagadougou. She became president of the\nAfrican Mathematical Union\nCommission on Women in Mathematics in Africa\n(\nAMUCWMA\n)\nin\n2009\n. She spoke about this role in\n[\n3\n]\n:-\n... as you should expect, there are not many women professors in Africa. The African Mathematical Union Commission on Women in Mathematics in Africa, which is a commission of the African Mathematical Union, founded in\n1986\n, is intended to correct and improve this weakness. Therefore, the AMUCWMA aims at:\ngenerating activities and programs meant to encourage women to study and make careers in Mathematical Sciences;\nmobilizing young girls all over the continent to show more interest inÂ  Mathematics;\npreparing and updating a directory of Women in Mathematics from all over the continent;\ncommissioning studies on various topics on Women in Mathematics in Africa; and\nco-operating with other organizations with similar objectives.\nAs President of the\nAfrican Mathematical Union\nCommission on Women in Mathematics in Africa, I was invited to the last congress of\nEuropean Women in Mathematics\nin Barcelona. After several discussions with Professor Marie-Francoise Roy, the convenor of\nEuropean Women in Mathematics\n, we decided to organize a workshop for African women mathematicians.\nIn October\n2012\n, as president of the\nAfrican Mathematical Union\nCommission on Women in Mathematics in Africa\n(\nAMUCWMA\n)\n, Ouedraogo co-hosted a workshop to generate interest in mathematics among African women. The workshop was jointly organised by the AMUCWMA and the International Centre of Pure and Applied Mathematics and held in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. At this workshop African women mathematicians proposed the setting up of an association and, at an AMUCWMA workshop at the African Institute of Mathematical Sciences of South Africa on\n19\nJuly\n2013\n, the\nAfrican Women in Mathematics Association\n(\nAWMA\n)\nwas created. Ouedraogo was elected as president.\nAt the International Congress ofÂ Women Mathematicians meeting \"Mathematics and Women: Different Regions, Similar Struggles\" held on Tuesday\n12\nAugust\n2014\n, Ouedraogo gave the talk\nSignificant issues affecting women in mathematics in Africa.\nShe said\n[\n5\n]\n:-\nIn Africa, among the holders of a doctorate in Mathematics,\n11\n% are women. Some of the classical problems that have contributed to the scarcity and also underperformance of women in mathematics in some regions of Africa are given as follows:\n1\n. The cultural and traditional bias: there is a bias in such developing countries and belief that mathematics and hard sciences are for boys and men, and you see it everywhere in implicit or explicit ways.\n2\n. The lack of networking and mutual support between junior and the few senior women mathematicians. Sometimes lack of this association and networks where women can encourage one another, forces women to try join the male associations where there is limited acceptance and less opportunities for women to improve on their profession al development and growth as leaders in their own field.\n3\n. The lack of role models and lack of a structured mentorship programme for young girls and emerging researchers within mathematics. These could involve matching interested young girls in mathematics and science to a senior mentor but such programmes work if they have structure and are funded. This is linked to the net for better networking amongst potential women mentors and developing such instruments.\n4\n. The lack of government strategies and policies to promote mathematics and increase access for all genders. If governments have science policy and strategies which promote mathematics, for instance, then funding will be attached to programmes to ensure there are opportunities for bursaries, training and skills development. The link between maths and success in schooling and developing the economy have to be visible at national level and contribute to resourcing schools and learning institutions within every African region.\nOuedraogo said that the\nAfrican Mathematical Union\nCommission on Women in Mathematics in Africa\n(\nAMUCWMA\n)\nand the\nAfrican Women in Mathematics Association\n(\nAWMA\n)\n, both having her as President, were working to solve these problems."
