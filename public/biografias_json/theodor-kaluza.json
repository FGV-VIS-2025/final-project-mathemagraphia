  "biografia": "Theodor Kaluza\n's father was Max Kaluza. He belonged to a family which had lived in Ratibor\n(\nnow Raciborz in Poland\n)\nfor around\n300\nyears. Max Kaluza was a fine scholar and, although German, he was a leading expert on the English language and English literature, with his special field being the study of Chaucer. Theodor, who was an only child, showed great promise at school and he entered the University of KÃ¶nigsberg to study mathematics.\nKaluza continued his studies at KÃ¶nigsberg working towards his doctorate under\nMeyer\n's supervision. His\nhabilitation\nthesis was on\nTschirnhaus\ntransformations and it was published in the\nArchiv der Mathematik und Physik\nin\n1910\n. He had been examined and received the right to lecture in universities in the previous year. Kaluza married in\n1909\nand, after his habilitation, became a\nPrivatdozent\nat the University of KÃ¶nigsberg, a position which left him with hardly any income. Most academics are promoted after a few years as a Privatdozent, but Kaluza clearly was not thought to be of sufficient merit for he remained a Privatdozent for\n20\nyears. One person who thought very highly of Kaluza, however, was\nEinstein\n.\nHe was teaching at KÃ¶nigsberg in April\n1919\nwhen he wrote to\nEinstein\nand told him about his ideas to unify\nEinstein\n's theory of gravity and\nMaxwell\n's theory of light.\nEinstein\nencouraged him to publish his highly original ideas which he did in\n1921\nin his paper on the unity problem of physics -\nZum UnitÃ¤tsproblem der Physik\nâ\n(\nOn the unity problem in physics\n)\npublished in\nSitzungsberichte Preussische Akademie der Wissenschaften\n96\n(1921)\n,\n69\n. It was\nEinstein\nwho communicated the paper on\n8\nDecember\n1921\n.\nKaluza's ideas involved the introduction of a fifth dimension and, although he has been criticised for introducing this as a purely mathematical idea, his work is important and was explored by others. He says in this paper that his theory possessed:-\n... virtually unsurpassed formal unity ... which could not amount to the mere alluring play of a capricious accident.\nThe unifying feature of this theory was that it unified\nEinstein\n's theory of gravitation and\nMaxwell\n's electromagnetic theory. As Kaku writes in\n[\n3\n]\n:-\n... this unknown scientist was proposing to combine, in one stroke, the two greatest field theories known to science,\nMaxwell\n's and\nEinstein\n's, by mixing them in the fifth dimension.\nKaluza is remembered for this in Kaluza-\nKlein\n(\nnamed after the mathematician\nOskar Klein\n)\nfield theory, which involved field equations in five-dimensional space. The theory, initially a popular topic of research, quickly lost favour with the introduction of\nquantum mechanics\n.\nIn November\n1926\nEinstein\nwrote in support of Kaluza to try to impress upon people that he was a mathematician who had produced a remarkably novel idea and was worth far more than the position of Privatdozent which he still occupied. Still Kaluza failed to gain promotion, then in\n1929\n, exactly\n20\nyears after being appointed a Privatdozent, he was appointed as professor in Kiel. In\n1935\nhe was made a full professor at GÃ¶ttingen where he remained until his death in\n1954\n, two months before he was due to retire.\nPerhaps Kaluza became too involved with his ideas in theoretical physics to make the contributions to mathematics which he was clearly capable of making. He continued to produce ideas relating to models of the atomic nucleus, and he wrote on relativity. Perhaps his finest mathematical work is the textbook\nHÃ¶here Mathematik fÃ¼r die Pracktiker\nâ\n(\nAdvanced mathematics in practice\n)\nwhich was written jointly with G Joos and published in\n1938\n. Raman writes\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nin this work he showed himself as a mathematician rather than as a mathematical physicist.\nHis son, also named Theodor Kaluza, contributed personal details of his father which were incorporated into\n[\n1\n]\n. These give us feeling for Kaluza's character as:-\n... a man of wide-ranging interests. Although mathematical abstraction delighted him tremendously, he was also deeply interested in languages, literature, and philosophy. He studied more than fifteen languages, including Hebrew, Hungarian, Arabic, and Lithuanian. He had a keen sense of humour. A nonswimmer, he once demonstrated the power of theoretical knowledge by reading a book on swimming, then swimming successfully on his first attempt\n(\nhe was over thirty when he performed this feat\n)\n. Kaluza loved nature as well as science and was also fond of children."
