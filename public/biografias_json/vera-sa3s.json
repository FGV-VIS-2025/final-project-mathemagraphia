  "biografia": "Vera SÃ³s\n' father was a school teacher and she was the younger of her parents two daughters. The family were Jewish which, of course, meant increasing difficulties due to the rise of anti-Semitism. Vera's father was a teacher in\n1919\nwhen there was a Communist take-over of Hungary. He was promoted to school Principal at this time but after a right wing government took over in\n1920\n, there was a rise of anti-Semitism with Jews attacked in the streets, and in retaliation for his promotion in the Communist period, he was forced to retire. He then had to support his family as a private tutor and managed to get some work as a substitute teacher.\nVera studied at the Jewish High School on Abonyi Street in Budapest and it was at this school that her passion for mathematics developed. In the\n1930\ns there had been around\n1200\npupils in two schools on Abonyi Street, one for boys and one for girls, but during World War II the buildings were taken over by the military and the pupils taught in temporary accommodation. The schools closed completely in March\n1944\nwhen the Germans occupied Budapest but, after the end of the war, reopened on Abonyi Street.\nThe biggest influence on SÃ³s at the Abonyi Street High School was\nTibor Gallai\n.\nPaul ErdÅs\nwrites in\n[\n3\n]\nthat\nGallai\n:-\n... is not only a first rate mathematician but also an excellent teacher. From\n1945\nto\n1949\nhe taught in the Jewish high school for girls in Budapest. In one year he had\n22\nstudents. Six of them became mathematicians and one of them, Vera T SÃ³s, became one of the leading mathematicians in Hungary.\nSÃ³s said\n[\n4\n]\n:-\n[\nGallai\n]\ntaught me for four years from the age of fourteen. ... He gave some of us special tasks. He handed us the High School Mathematical Magazines, which only came as stencilled copies after the war. He sent us to competitions. Thanks to him, I was able to get to know\nAlfred RÃ©nyi\n,\nRÃ³zsa PÃ©ter\n, and\nPaul ErdÅs\nwhen I was a high school student. But perhaps more importantly, it was\nGallai\nwho introduced me to the joy of understanding, of discovering, of the attractiveness of mathematics.\nGallai\ngave SÃ³s university textbooks to read while she was at school, including the book by\nKonrad Knopp\n,\nTheorie und Anwendung der Unendlichen Reihen\nâ\n(\nTheory and application of infinite rings\n)\n(1922)\n.\nRÃ³zsa PÃ©ter\nwas always interested in talented young mathematicians and she tested SÃ³s out by giving her some logical problems. She wanted to find out not how much mathematics SÃ³s knew but rather how she thought.\nSÃ³s graduated from the Abonyi Street High School in\n1948\nand entered the Mathematics-Physics Faculty of\nEÃ¶tvÃ¶s LorÃ¡nd\nUniversity.\nPaul ErdÅs\nwas the best friend of the Gallai family.\nErdÅs\n's mother lived in Abonyi Street, opposite the High School, and\nGallai\nvisited her house regularly, occasionally taking some of us with him. So when\nErdÅs\nfirst came home after the war in\n1948\n, we got to know him.\nErdÅs\n's mother, Anna, was in exactly the same position as SÃ³s's father. She was Jewish and had been a teacher promoted to school Principal at the time when the Communists came to power in\n1919\n, but, after a right wing government took over in\n1920\n, she suffered the same fate as SÃ³s's father having to earn money through private tutoring.\nAt\nEÃ¶tvÃ¶s LorÃ¡nd\nUniversity, SÃ³s's teachers included\nLipÃ³t FejÃ©r\n,\nFrigyes Riesz\n, GyÃ¶rgy HajÃ³s\n(1912\n-\n1972)\n,\nPaul TurÃ¡n\n, PÃ¡l SzÃ¡sz\n(1901\n-\n1957)\n, and\nAlfrÃ©d RÃ©nyi\n. SÃ³s said\n[\n4\n]\n:-\nMy university years were euphoric for me. Some of us were thrown into deep water: from my second year, I became an employee of\nEÃ¶tvÃ¶s LorÃ¡nd\nUniversity as a demonstrator. ... it was typical of the conditions at the time that the mathematics departments were not as sharply separated as they are today. There was a Mathematics Institute and some departments. I was appointed to the\nFejÃ©r\nDepartment. Before the war, and even for a year or two after, there were only two or three mathematicians full-time at the university. Since the\n1950\ns, the structure of education has changed, with many students entering the university and the number of compulsory lectures and tutorials increasing. The new situation required more tutorial teachers. This is how I was able to conduct exercises in geometry, differential geometry, probability theory and analysis. I consider all of this lucky because that is how one really learns what one is able to understand in some way. I didn't teach algebra and number theory. Later I got close to number theory, but unfortunately not to algebra. Today, I admire the courage that I dared to teach with my second year head on so many topics.\nTheÂ First Hungarian Mathematical CongressÂ was organised in\n1950\nin Budapest and dedicated to the celebration of the\n70\nth birthday of\nRiesz\nand\nFejÃ©r\n. It was attended by many mathematicians of high reputation from abroad. SÃ³s made a geometry presentation to this Congress. Meanwhile she had a summer internship in a factory which made screws. The factory manufactured screws of different sizes and she had to take a sample of the output ever\n5\nto\n10\nminutes. She then did a statistical analysis of the data she had collected and by the end of a month she had produced a \"theory of screws.\" Perhaps this was her first venture into applied mathematics. While still an undergraduate, she was employed as an instructor at\nEÃ¶tvÃ¶s LorÃ¡nd\nUniversity beginning in\n1950\nand conducting exercise classes in the topics she mentioned in the above quote. In\n1952\nshe graduated with the Diploma in mathematics and physics from\nEÃ¶tvÃ¶s LorÃ¡nd\nUniversity and began to undertake graduate studies advised by\nLipÃ³t FejÃ©r\n. In the same year she married\nPaul TurÃ¡n\nwho had taught her when she was an undergraduate; they had two children, Gyorgy TurÃ¡n born in\n1953\n, who is now Professor of Mathematics at the College of Liberal Arts and Science, University if Illinois, and Thomas TurÃ¡n born in\n1960\n. In\n1953\nshe became a Faculty Member at\nEÃ¶tvÃ¶s LorÃ¡nd\nUniversity.\nSpeaking about her advisor\nLipÃ³t FejÃ©r\nin\n[\n4\n]\nshe said:-\n... conversations with him were interesting and memorable, he felt what it was like to work around a problem, to solve a mathematics problem, and what was the beauty of mathematics. ...\n[\nHe was an\n]\nopen, sociable, helpful individual. He was a pianist, he was a friend of poets, he loved life.\nShe did not, however, write a thesis on the topics which\nFejÃ©r\nstudied, namely analysis, although she worked on that topic between\n1952\nand\n1955\n.\nVera SÃ³s is known as an outstanding expert in number theory and combinatorics but so far we have not described any contributions she has made to these areas. Her first publication was 'V T SÃ³s, Solution of problem\n28\n,\nMatematikai Lapok\n3\n(1952)\n,\n91\n'. In this she gave a different proof of a result due to\nErdÅs\n, namely that:\nIf a real-valued additive function\nf\nf\nf\nis non-decreasing, or satisfies\nf\n(\nn\n+\n1\n)\nâ\nf\n(\nn\n)\nf(n+1) - f(n)\nf\n(\nn\n+\n1\n)\nâ\nf\n(\nn\n)\nâ\n0\nas\nn\nâ\nâ\nn \\rightarrow  â\nn\nâ\nâ\nthen it must have the form\nA\nlog\nâ¡\nn\nA \\log n\nA\nlo\ng\nn\nfor some constant\nA\nA\nA\n.\nIn fact it was chance events which took her to number theory and combinatorics as we shall now relate. The first problem on combinatorics that she worked on was the crossing number of complete bipartite graph. Her Jewish husband,\nPaul TurÃ¡n\n, had been put into various labour camps during World War II. He writes in\n[\n5\n]\n:-\nWe worked near Budapest, in a brick factory. There were some kilns where the bricks were made and some open storage yards where the bricks were stored. All the kilns were connected by rail with all the storage yards. The bricks were carried on small wheeled trucks to the storage yards. All we had to do was to put the bricks on the trucks at the kilns, push the trucks to the storage yards, and unload them there. We had a reasonable piece rate for the trucks, and the work itself was not difficult; the trouble was only at the crossings. The trucks generally jumped the rails there, and the bricks fell out of them; in short this caused a lot of trouble and loss of time which was precious to all of us. We were all sweating and cursing at such occasions, I too; but 'nolens volens' the idea occurred to me that this loss of time could have been minimised if the number of crossings of the rails had been minimised. But what is the minimum number of crossings? I realised after several days that the actual situation could have been improved, but the exact solution of the general problem with s kilns and t storage yards seemed to be very difficult. ... the problem occurred to me again ... at my first visit to Poland where I met\nZarankiewicz\n. I mentioned to him my 'brick-factory' problem and\nZarankiewicz\nthought he had solved it. But Gerhard Ringel found a gap in his published proof, which nobody has been able to fill so far - in spite of much effort. This problem has also become a notoriously difficult unsolved problem.\nSÃ³s,\nTurÃ¡n\nand their colleague TamÃ¡s KovÃ¡ri worked on the problem and, although they did not solve it, they made substantial progress and published the paper 'TamÃ¡s KovÃ¡ri, Vera T SÃ³s and\nPÃ¡l TurÃ¡n\n, On a problem of\nK Zarankiewicz\n,\nColloquium Mathematicum\n1\n(3)\n(1954)\n,\n50\n-\n57\n'. This was the beginning of SÃ³s's work on graph theory and combinatorics. The start of her working on number theory was equally by chance. This time it was SÃ³s who went to Poland where she talked to\nHugo Steinhaus\nwho told her about a problem on Diophantine approximation. SÃ³s immediately began working on the problem sitting in a cafe in Krakow, and there proved her first results in number theory. Her first paper on the topic was again joint with her husband: 'Vera SÃ³s and\nP TurÃ¡n\n, On some new theorems in the theory of Diophantine approximations,\nActa Mathematica Hungarica\n6\n(3\n-\n4)\n(1955)\n,\n241\n-\n255\n'. This was followed by her single authored papers\nOn the theory of diophantine approximations.\nI\n(\non a problem of A Ostrowski\n)\n(1957)\n,\nOn a geometrical theory of continued fractions\n(\nHungarian\n)\n(1957)\n,\nOn the theory of diophantine approximations\nII\n(\ninhomogeneous problems\n)\n(1958)\n, and\nOn the distribution mod\n1\nof the sequence\n{\nn\nÎ±\n}\n\\{n\\alpha\\}\n{\nn\nÎ±\n}\n(1958)\n.\nSÃ³s had produced far more results than are required for a thesis and she was awarded the degrees Doctor Rherum Naturarum from\nEÃ¶tvÃ¶s LorÃ¡nd\nUniversity, Candidate of the Mathematical Sciences from the\nHungarian Academy of Sciences\n, and Doctor of the Mathematical Sciences from the\nHungarian Academy of Sciences\nin\n1957\nfor\nA geometric treatment of continued fractions and its application to the theory of diophantine approximation\n(\nHungarian\n)\n.\nBeginning in\n1957\n, every summer SÃ³s and her husband\nPaul TurÃ¡n\nvisited the resort of MÃ¡trahÃ¡za in the MÃ¡tra mountains in northern Hungary. Their visits would coincide with visits by\nErdÅs\nand his mother, and by\nAlfrÃ©d RÃ©nyi\nand his wife Katalin who was also a mathematician. Discussions with\nErdÅs\ndid not lead to any further papers on combinatorics by SÃ³s for a few years, and she continued to work on number theory. In\n1962\n, however, there appeared the\n3\n-author paper\nOn a problem in the theory of graphs\nco-authored by\nErdÅs\n,\nRÃ©nyi\nand SÃ³s.\nIn\n1961\nSÃ³s began teaching a combinatorics course at\nEÃ¶tvÃ¶s LorÃ¡nd\nUniversity and, in the first year she taught it,\nBÃ©la BollobÃ¡s\ntook the course. Over the next few years she published many joint papers, particularly important were those on\nRamsey\n-\nTurÃ¡n\n-type problems. The first, published in\n1970\n, was the joint\nErdÅs\nand SÃ³s paper\nSome remarks on Ramsey's and TurÃ¡n's theorem\nwhich appeared in the\nProceeding\nof the Colloquium on Combinatorial Mathematics which had been held at BalatonfÃ¼red, a resort town on the northern shore of Lake Balaton in Hungary, in August\n1969\n.\nLÃ¡szlÃ³ Babai writes in\n[\n2\n]\n(\nsee also\n[\n1\n]\n)\n:-\nSÃ³s's energy and her dedication to the causes of the mathematical community have been extraordinary. She is unequalled in the constant attention she has devoted to promising students. In\n1965\nshe initiated and launched the famous weekly\nHajnal\n-SÃ³s seminar at the Mathematical Institute of the\nHungarian Academy of Sciences\n. For the past three decades, that seminar has been a major forum for new results in combinatorics, often made by young mathematicians, including undergraduate students. Since the mid sixties, SÃ³s has been the driving force behind the periodic international conferences in combinatorics under the auspices of the\nBolyai Society\n. Hungary was then a meeting place between East and West. ... These meetings helped combinatorists from the Soviet bloc, especially Hungarians, build personal contacts with colleagues world wide at a time when travel to the West was extremely limited.\nErdÅs\ndescribes meeting Vera SÃ³s in July\n1976\nand learning about her husband's illness\n[\n3\n]\n:-\n... in JulyÂ\n1976\n, at the meeting on combinatorics at Orsay in Paris, Vera SÃ³sÂ gave me the terrible newsÂ\n(\nwhich she had known for six years\n)\nÂ that\nPaul\nhad leukaemia. She told me that I should visit him as soon as possible and that I should be careful in talking to him because he did not know the true nature of his illness. My first reaction was to say that perhaps he should have been told ... She said that\nPaul\nloved life too much and with a death sentence hanging over him would not be able to live and work very well. ... I am now fairly sure that her decision was right, since he clearly never tried to find out the true nature of his illness. In fact a few days before his deathÂ VeraÂ and their son GeorgeÂ\n(\nalso a mathematician\n)\nÂ tried to persuade him to dictate some parts of his book to HalÃ¡sz or Pintz. He refused saying \"I will write it when I feel better and stronger.\" Unfortunately he never had the chance. Fortunately his book was finished by his students G HalÃ¡sz and J Pintz ...\nLet us record some of SÃ³s's views of mathematics and other matters from the interview she gave in\n2000\n(\nsee\n[\n4\n]\n)\n. Asked what she found so attractive about mathematics, she said:-\nThe joy of knowing, understanding, and creating is common to all the sciences. There are different ways to find the truth. In mathematics, strict logical inference will lead to the proving or refutation of a conjecture. Sitting here in a room, regardless of the outside world, I can decide whether or not it is true. This in itself is attractive, as there is so much uncertainty in the world.\nAsked about the changes she has seen in mathematics during her career, she said:-\nMathematics, like the whole world, has changed in many ways. Mathematics has broadened, it has changed in quantity and in character. The topics studied, the nature and style of research, the relationship between mathematics and the natural and social sciences have changed ... Everybody's expectations have changed, the world of science, of mathematicians, and obviously the research spirit, has changed, since the age into which we are born, it also shapes our personality. There has been an explosion in science, an incredible race. The change is also signalled by the fact that becoming a mathematician has become an occupation. Sixty years ago, this was not the case. Only a few mathematicians worked at the Budapest University of Technology and the University of Technology. They didn't need a degree in mathematics.\nResearch has changed in both quantity and quality. ... The world, its values, the attitude to life, have changed. The explosive growth created a high degree of specialisation. At the same time, the complexity of profound results and their proofs presupposes the unity of mathematics, the recognition of the relation between seemingly completely separate areas of mathematics, and the joint possession of their knowledge. Managing and controlling this two-way trend is a fundamental issue.\nThe nature and importance of mathematicians' cooperation has changed. There had been joint research in the past, but more often it was the simultaneous, independent discovery of the same result or the advancement of alternate steps based on each other's work. Over the last few decades, handwritten mail has been replaced by communication within seconds. This, and internationally funded projects, put cooperation in a different role. Why would mathematicians stay in an \"ideal\" state when they might say: I don't care about the outside world, I don't care how much support I get for my research, how much I get paid, I don't care if I have an apartment, I don't care if I can give my children food or not, I just care about proving a theorem. Talent and dedication are a necessary but less and less sufficient condition for being a researcher.\nLet us end this biography by giving some details of the honours and awards given to SÃ³s\n(\nsee\n[\n7\n]\n)\n. She was elected a Corresponding member of\nHungarian Academy of Sciences\nÂ in\n1985\n, and an Ordinary member of\nHungarian Academy of Sciences\nÂ in\n1990\n. She was also elected a Corresponding member of the\nAustrian Academy of Sciences\nin\n1995\n. She was awarded the\nTibor Szele\nPrize from the\nJÃ¡nos Bolyai Mathematical Society\nfor founding a schoolÂ\n(1974)\n; the Prize in Mathematics of\nHungarian Academy of Sciences\nÂ\n(1983)\n; the Benedikt Otto Prize, Hungary\n(1994)\n; the Szechenyi Prize, Hungary\n(1997)\n; the Cross of Merit, HungaryÂ\n(2002)\n; and the \"My Country\" Award, Hungary\n(2007)\n."
