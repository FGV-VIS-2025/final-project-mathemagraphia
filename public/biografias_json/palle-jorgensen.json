  "biografia": "Palle Jorgensen\nwas the son of Soren A W Jorgensen and Â Gyrit D Baden. Palle's father, Soren Jorgensen, was an electrical engineer, while his mother Gyrit was a mathematics teacher. Palle Jorgensen writes\n[\n5\n]\n:-\nMy grandfather on my mother's side, Rasmus Bortmann TikÃ¸b Baden, was a biblical scholar, and he was deeply interested in science. A quote from Pastor Baden that sticks in my mind\n(\nI must have been\n4\nor\n5\nyears old at the time\n)\n, is this: \"Mathematics and physics is the wisdom of God, while the social sciences represent the study of stupidity of Mankind.\" At this very early age, all three, my mother, father, and Pastor Baden, profoundly influenced my thinking. I always believe that what we learn in the first\n5\nto\n10\nyears of our lives, has much more of an impact than what comes later. Early influences from my mother include geometry, complex numbers, and\nTaylor\n's formula.  My mother was extremely good at languages. Perhaps our learning of mathematics has a lot in common with that of languages. With hindsight, I realized that I acquired a facility with three \"foreign\" languages from my mother; way back in my formative years. At the same time, from listening to my father discuss high-pass and low-pass filters, and long-distance transmission, I picked up fundamentals of signal processing. I am reminded of this signal processing-inspiration in my much later research on wavelet multiresolutions; and I mention it in my Wavelet book from\n2002\n.\nHe went into a little more detail about the influence of his father's work on high-pass and low-pass filters in\n[\n4\n]\n(\nsee also\n[\n2\n]\n)\n:-\nWhen I was little, growing up in Denmark, - before kindergarten; only there wasn't any then ..., - so before I heard of 'The Tinder Box', or 'The Ugly Duckling' from the books of Hans Christian Andersen, my father told me about low-pass and high-pass filters. He was a telephone engineer and worked on the filters used in signals transmitted over long cables, just after the war, WWII. The 'high' and 'low' part of the story refers to frequency bands of the sound signals. Not that this meant much to me at the time. Rather, I was fascinated by the pictures in the EE journals that were stacked up on the floor next to me, and I spent hours looking at them\n[\n- that was all there was, there on the floor!\n]\n, so these pictures of filter design, some in colour, occupied me on long Sundays while my dad was building instruments in the living room. Nothing else for me to do! Then, after going to school, I forgot all about my dad's explanation of quadrature mirror filters; no wonder\n(\n!!\n)\n, and they were out of mind for a very long time. I never had any particular reason to think much about them at all, I mean the low-pass frequency bands and all that, but I am sure they in some strange way created a lasting visual impression for me.\nHe wrote about the later influences on him in\n[\n5\n]\n:-\nAs a child, from age\n11\nto\n17\n, in my school-summer breaks, I made trips of my own, hitchhiking, off to youth work-camps abroad, in England, Germany, France, and\n(\na Zionist youth group\n)\nin Israel, at kibbutzim.Â Later in High School and at the University, I was fortunate to have had extremely inspiring teachers; but especially fortunate to have been part of a generation of students with ambitions to excel in mathematics and in the sciences. The closest parallel to High School in Denmark is called Gymnasium. The name of mine was Marselisborg Gymnasium in Aarhus. Denmark tutorial: This was a\n3\n-year programme, and I was blessed with great teachers, in mathematics, in the sciences, and in languages. The curriculum at the time included calculus and linear algebra.\n(\nThe curriculum has probably been watered down since then.\n)\nAnother interest of mine from this time includes economics.\nJorgensen entered Aarhus University and was awarded a B.A. in\n1968\n, an M.S. in\n1970\nand a Ph.D. in Mathematics in\n1973\nfor his thesis\nInfinite-dimensional representations of Lie algebras and Lie groups\n. There were many important influences on Jorgensen during these years. One was\nKiyosi Ito\nwho, although a professor at Kyoto University from\n1952\nuntil he retired in\n1979\n, but held a position as professor at Aarhus University in the years\n1966\n-\n69\nwhile Jorgensen was a graduate student. His thesis advisor at Aarhus was Niels Kristian Skovhus Poulsen who had himself graduated with a Ph.D. in\n1970\nadvised by\nIrving Segal\n. Jorgensen writes\n[\n5\n]\n:-\nAt Aarhus University, I had great mathematics teachers, and of my fellow mathematics graduate students, more than a handful ended up as professional mathematicians, and at top universities, both in Denmark, and in the USA. An early, and especially inspiring, mathematics teacher of mine, and of my generation, who stands out is Svend Bundgaard. In fact, Professor Svend Bundgaard was still around in the early\n1980\ns when I was then on the faculty in the Mathematics Department at Aarhus University.\nLet us say a little more about Svend Bundgaard\n(1912\n-\n1984)\n. He was educated at the University of Copenhagen and, after teaching at that university, was appointed to a chair at the newly established Faculty of Science at Aarhus University in\n1954\n. He played a significant role in the expansion of that faculty, particularly the Mathematical Institute, serving as the university's principal in the years\n1971\n-\n1976\n. He was also co-founder of the journal\nMathematica Scandinavica\n.\nThe results from Jorgensen's thesis became part of the later monograph\nOperator commutation relations.Â Commutation relations for operators, semigroups, and resolvents with applications to mathematical physics and representations of Lie groups\nwritten jointly with Robert T Moore and published in\n1984\n. A review by Derek W Robinson begins\n[\n13\n]\n:-\nIn the last thirty years the theory of continuous one-parameter groups and semigroups on\nBanach\nspaces has flourished. This theory, which has its historical roots in the dynamical description of quantum-mechanical systems, has subsequently found applications in many fields of mathematics. The main emphasis of this development has been on the analysis of single groups, or semigroups, and their generators. Less effort has been devoted to the study of the analytic structure of families of noncommuting groups and semigroups. Again such problems found their earliest motivation in quantum theory, notably with\nHeisenberg\n's formulation in terms of families of noncommuting observables. Problems of this nature form the principal object of the monograph under review and the authors attempt, with some success, to show that analysis of operator commutation relations leads to a unification of diverse areas of mathematics.\nAfter the award of his doctorate, Jorgensen was awarded a Danish Natural Science Research Council multi-year post-doctoral fellowship which allowed him to conduct research at universities abroad; foreign travel and international contacts were strongly encouraged. He went to the United States in\n1973\nand, supported by the fellowship, became a visiting scholar at Princeton University. In\n1975\nhe published his first paper\nRepresentations of differential operators on a Lie group\nwhich was on Hunt processes on\nLie\ngroups. He writes\n[\n5\n]\n:-\nThis research was inspired to a large extent by pioneering research of Ed Nelson, and\nLars HÃ¶rmander\n.\nThe address on the paper is Department of Mathematics, Princeton University, and the research was sponsored by Odense University, Denmark. The way such postdoctoral fellowships worked in Denmark at this time meant that the funding was fromÂ The Danish Natural Science Research Council but the research was sponsored by one or more of the Universities. In Jorgensen's case it was sponsored by Odense University and Aarhus University, Denmark. The paper has the following Acknowledgements:-\nThe author is indebted to a large number of mathematicians for helpful discussions. He learned about group representations from Niels Skovhus Poulsen. Professor M Reed originally showed interest in the idea of looking at quadratic expressions of infinitesimal generators. Professors V Bargmann, G B Folland, R Goodman, A Klein, R T Moore, E Nelson,\nE Stein\n, and A S Wightman have shown interest in various partial results on the way. Professors J J Kohn and F Treves have been helpful with certain differential operator aspects. Valuable improvements have been suggested by the referee. Finally, the author wishes to thank Gregg Zuckerman for many helpful discussions on\nLie\ngroup representations.\nJorgensen's next paper was\nApproximately reducing subspaces for unbounded linear operators\n(1976)\nand, by this time, he had moved to University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. He writes in the Acknowledgements:-\nIt is a pleasure to thank Professor S Sakai for suggesting the problem and for constant encouragement.\nIn\n[\n5\n]\nJorgensen explains that his research during his time at the University of Pennsylvania moved in the direction of operator algebras and mathematical physics. It was inspired by\nRichard V Kadison\n, his postdoctoral advisor, by Robert T Powers, and by ShÃ´ichirÃ´ Sakai.\nJorgensen married Soon-Min Park on\n4\nJanuary\n1975\n. They had three children, Anton Yang Jorgensen\n(\nborn\n24\nOctober\n1975)\n, Greta Soon Jorgensen\n(\nborn\n6\nSeptember\n1978)\nand Tina Soon Jorgensen.\nIn the summer of\n1976\nJorgensen was an invited member of the NSF Summer Research Institute in Operator Theory at the University of New Hampshire. After working at the University of Pennsylvania until\n1977\n, he moved to Stanford University in that year where he became an Assistant Professor\n[\n5\n]\n:-\nImportant influences from the late\n1970\ns include Ralph S Phillips,Â\nHans Samelson\n,\nPaul Cohen\n, Kai Lai Chung,Â JamesÂ McGregor,Â and ...  at Stanford. Jorgensen was an assistant professor at Stanford University in that period, and his research was then especially inspired by the Stanford faculty, and graduate students, e.g., Peter Sarnak, at the time.\nIn\n1979\nJorgensen petitioned for naturalisation in the district court at San Francisco. He was supported by two witnesses, Soon Min Jorgensen, his wife, and William Arveson\n(1934\n-\n2011)\nwho was a Professor of Mathematics at the University of California, Berkeley, researching on operator algebras. At this time Jorgensen was living on California Street, Mountain View, Santa Clara, California. He was issued with a naturalisation certificate on\n24\nJuly\n1979\n. He was awarded a Danish Research Council grant and went to the Mathematics Institute, University of Aarhus, Denmark as an Associate Professor in\n1979\n. For one year he was on leave from Stanford University but he remained at Aarhus after that year, resigning from Stanford. He continued to hold the position at Aarhus until\n1983\nbut in\n1982\nhe spent a year back at the University of Pennsylvania as a Visiting Associate Professor\n[\n5\n]\n:-\nJorgensen was on the faculty at University of Pennsylvania again in the early\n1980\ns. This time was also the beginning of collaboration with\nOla Bratteli\nwhich stretched over decades: many joint research publications. Other co-authors in these papers included Derek W Robinson, and George A Elliott.\nAt the end of one year at the University of Pennsylvania, Jorgensen was appointed as a Professor in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Iowa. He resigned his position in Aarhus and was given a year leave of absence from Iowa so that he could continue as a Visiting Associate Professor at the University of Pennsylvania, and start teaching at the University of Iowa in\n1984\n. In the interview\n[\n2\n]\nhe said:-\n[\nAt the University of Iowa\n]\nI have been teaching most of the undergraduate courses, but in the last few years mostly graduate courses, and I collaborate with colleagues in physics\n(\nthe theory group\n)\nand in engineering\n(\nindustrial, computer and electrical engineering.\n)\nI teach courses in analysis, in functional analysis, in applied mathematics\n(\nespecially physics, signal and image processing.\n[\nMy main mathematics interests are\n]\noperator theory, functional analysis, dynamical systems, among others. Otherwise my professional interests stretch from mathematics to physics, and from engineering\n(\nsignal and image processing\n)\nand to financial mathematics\n(\nstochastic differential equations!\n)\n... I enjoy reading. I also enjoy teaching, giving seminars, and working with students, especially my Ph.D. students.\nJorgensen is the author or co-author of at least eleven books\n(\nand has been an editor of several more\n)\n. We give some information about books of which he is an author or  co-author at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nA recent biography states\n[\n12\n]\n:-\n[\nJorgensen's\n]\npublication list includes more than\n200\nresearch papers, and\n8\nbooks: in mathematics, both pure and applied\n(\noperator algebras, and harmonic analysis\n)\n, and mathematical physics\n(\nquantum theory\n)\n. Palle Jorgensen's research covers a wide spectrum, stochastic processes, white noise analysis, harmonic analysis, applied functional analysis, PDE, dynamical systems, discrete algorithms, applied stochastic analysis, and Jorgensen's research makes connections to a number of applied areas, and he has interacted with colleagues from other departments, both at the university of Iowa, and at other universities around the world. This includes colleagues in departments of physics, engineering\n(\ndepartment of computer and electrical engineering\n)\n, department of statistic and actuarial science\n(\nUniversity of Iowa.\n)\nOver the past seven years Jorgensen has taught financial mathematics both at the graduate level, as well as an undergrad course in derivative securities. These courses draw students from mathematics, from statistics and actuarial science, from engineering, from economics, and from finance. While at the University of Iowa, Jorgensen has had\n24\nPh.D. students, with thesis covering both pure and applied themes.\nEditorial work which Jorgensen has undertaken includes: editor of\nActa Applicandae Mathematicae\n; editor of the\nProceedings\nof the\nAmerican Mathematical Society\n; editor of\nProyecciones: Revista de MatemÃ¡tica\n; editor of the\nPanamerican Mathematical Journal\n; editor of the\nJournal of Mathematical Sciences\n(\nnew series, Delhi, India\n)\n; editor of the\nJournal of Applied Mathematics and Computing\n, editor of the\nJournal of Basic & Applied Sciences\n, editor of\nComplex Analysis and Operator Theory\n, and editor of the\nJournal of Nonlinear Functional Analysis\n.\nJorgensen was honoured with election to the Danish Academy of Natural Sciences in\n1982\n, the year in which the academy was founded."
