  "biografia": "Heinrich Scherk\n, the son of a foreman, was born in PoznaÅ where he lived until he was eleven years old.  At this time his family moved to Breslau where Heinrich attended elementary school, then completed his school education at the Magdalenen High School. It was at the High School that he became interested in mathematics and astronomy, topics which he worked on throughout his life. As is so often the case, it was an excellent teacher at the school who fired his enthusiasm for these subjects.\nScherk completed his school studies in\n1818\nand entered the University of Breslau. Despite his interest in mathematics and astronomy at school, he first studied philology, philosophy and history when he entered university. However he soon changed his courses to study the topics he had come to love at school. It was H W Brandes who taught him mathematics and astronomy at the University of Breslau, and quickly realised that Scherk had an outstanding pupil. Scherk's family was poor and did not have the funds to support him at university, although he did have an uncle and a friend of his father who both contributed to his expenses. With insufficient funds, he had to spend many hours giving private tuition in order to support himself. Brandes saw that his talented pupil was struggling financially, and was able to recommend him for a University Scholarship. This made Scherk financially secure for the two years of its duration, and allowed him to devote himself fully to his studies.\nIn\n1820\n, still holding the scholarship, he went to KÃ¶nigsberg to study with\nBessel\n. It was on Brandes' advice that he went to study with the famous astronomer and it certainly paid off since he wrote his first paper\nParabolische Elemente des Kometen von\n1818\nâ\n(\nParabolic elements of the comet of\n1818\n)\nunder\nBessel\n's guidance. It was published in Bode's astronomical yearbook. Although his scholarship was due to run out in\n1821\n,\nBessel\nwas successful in arguing for an extension to a third year. Scherk's doctoral studies, in which he was advised by\nBessel\nand  Brandes, led to him submitting his doctoral thesis\nDe evolvenda functione ... disquisitiones nonnullae analyticae\nâ\n(\nStudy of some analytical functions\n)\nto the University of Berlin in\n1823\n, receiving the degree on\n27\nAugust.\nAfter receiving his doctorate in Berlin, Scherk returned to KÃ¶nigsberg where he married Johanne Rosalie Karo; they had at least four daughters and four sons. He continued working for his\nhabilitation\nwhich took place in KÃ¶nigsberg in\n1824\n. He then became a\nprivatdozent\nin KÃ¶nigsberg and worked on mathematical papers which he completed in April\n1825\n. These were published by G Riemer in Berlin in a single volume which contained:\nVon den numerischen Coefficienten der Secantenreihe, ihrem Zusammenhange, und ihrer Analogie mit den Bernoullischen Zahlen\nâ\n(\nOf the numerical coefficients of the Secant series, their context, and their analogy with the Bernoulli numbers\n)\n;\nAllgemeine AuflÃ¶sung der Gleichungen des ersten Grades, mit jeder beliebigen Anzahl von unbekannten GrÃ¶ssen, und einige dahin gehÃ¶rige analytische Untersuchungen\nâ\n(\nGeneral solution of equations of the first degree, with any number of unknown quantities, and some meaning related analytical studies\n)\n;\nDie Anzahl der Combinationen mit eingeschrÃ¤nkten Wiederholungen zu einer gegebenen Classe zu bestimmen\nâ\n(\nThe number of combinations to determine with limited repetitions at a given class\n)\n; and\nNeuer Beweis des Taylorschen Satzes\nâ\n(\nNew evidence of Taylor's theorem\n)\n. After two years as a privatdozent in KÃ¶nigsberg, Scherk was appointed as an extraordinary professor in Halle.\nBessel\nhad strongly supported this appointment which began on\n4\nMarch\n1826\n.\nScherk taught at Halle for seven years from\n1826\nto\n1833\n. Perhaps the most important of the many tasks which he carried out during this time was in supervising the doctoral studies of\nKummer\nwho received his doctorate on\n10\nSeptember\n1831\nfor his thesis\nDe cosinuum et sinuum potestatibus secundum cosinus et sinus arcuum multiplicium evolvendis\nâ\n(\nThe cosines and sines of multiple arcs expressed in terms of sines and cosines\n)\n. Remarkably over\n11\n,\n000\nmathematicians can trace their academic parentage back to Scherk through\nKummer\n. At Halle, Scherk taught a wide range of courses such as: analytic geometry of lines and the conic sections; analytic geometry of lines and surfaces of the first and second degree; algebra and\nalgebraic geometry\n; plane and spherical trigonometry; integral calculus; and differential calculus and its application to algebra, analysis and geometry. His research was earning him praise and, in\n1831\n, he was awarded a prize by the Jablonowsky Society in Leipzig for his eassy\nDe proprietatibus superficiei quae hac continetur aequatione\n(\n1\n+\nq\n2\n)\nr\nâ\n2\np\nq\ns\n+\n(\n1\n+\np\n2\n)\nt\n=\n0\n(1+q^{2})r - 2pqs + (1+p^{2})t = 0\n(\n1\n+\nq\n2\n)\nr\nâ\n2\np\nq\ns\n+\n(\n1\n+\np\n2\n)\nt\n=\n0\ndisquisitiones analyticae\nâ\n(\nThe properties of the surface which has the equation\n(1\n+ q\n2\n)\nr -\n2\npqs +\n(1\n+ p\n2\n)\nt =\n0\ninvestigated analytically\n)\n.\nOn\n5\nJuly\n1831\nScherk was appointed to the chair of mathematics at Halle which had been vacant since the death of\nJohann Friedrich Pfaff\nin\n1825\n. On\n13\nSeptember\n1833\nScherk was appointed as a successor to N T Reimer as the ordinary professor for mathematics and astronomy at the University of Kiel. In the years\n1841\n,\n1842\nand\n1848\nScherk was chosen as Rector of the University of Kiel.  He represented the University on a number of important occasions such as the Reformation celebrations in Copenhagen in\n1836\nmarking\n300\nyears since the final triumph of the Reformation in Denmark in\n1536\n, the coronation of Christian VIII in\n1840\nwhen he was enthroned as king of Denmark, and the anniversary celebration of the University of KÃ¶nigsberg in\n1844\nto celebrate its founding by Albert, the first duke of Prussia, in\n1544\n.\nIn\n1840\nScherk was made a Knight of the Order of Dannebrog, the second highest honour in Denmark\n(\nDannebrog is the name for the Danish flag\n)\n.\nBessel\ndied in March\n1846\nand later that year, at the annual meeting of the Association of German Natural Scientists and Physicians in Kiel, Scherk gave a fine speech in his memory.\nKiel was the capital of Schleswig-Holstein and this was a region which had been the cause of many disputes over a long period; in the\n19\nth\ncentury this was known as the Schleswig-Holstein question. Holstein became part of the German Federation in\n1815\n, while Schleswig was associated with Denmark. The two regions had historic links, and Schleswig had a sizeable German speaking minority, also Holstein had a small Danish speaking minority. In\n1848\nthere was an uprising by the German speaking minorities in Schleswig-Holstein demanding independence from Denmark. Prussia intervened to support the uprising which led to a war which lasted from\n1848\nto\n1850\n.  Scherk, however, was a German patriot and one of the three supervisors of the first German sea-cadet school in Kiel set up in\n1848\n, where he was head of mathematics training. This, however, was to lead to problems for Scherk when the political treaty to end the war was agreed. The major powers pressured Prussia into accepting the London Convention of\n1852\nwhich required the German Federation to give Schleswig-Holstein to Denmark. On\n4\nJune\n1852\nScherk, together with seven other colleagues, were dismissed by the University of Kiel for political reasons. However, it was done:-\n... without indication of a substantial reason, without judgement and right, and without a preceding investigation.\nIt is clear, however, that Scherk's German patriotism was unacceptable in the now Danish Schleswig-Holstein. The Faculty of Philosophy at the University of Halle tried unsuccessfully to reappoint Scherk, and attempts at Kiel to have him reinstated in his former post were equally unsuccessful. In the autumn of\n1852\nScherk left Kiel and went to Dresden where he gave private tuition at the Blochmann Institute.\nOn\n12\nDecember\n1854\nScherk was appointed as director of the HÃ¶heren Gewerbeschule in Bremen. The School was then just reopening after a period of closure and, in\n1857\n, it was forced to close again. In the following year Scherk was appointed as a teacher at the Handelsschule\n(\npart of the High School\n)\nin Bremen. At first this was only a temporary appointment but it became a permanent one on\n22\nMay\n1863\n. He spent the final ten years of his career in this position, retiring in\n1874\n. During his years in Bremen he gave many popular lectures to the Scientific Association. These included talks on astronomy on topics such as: meteors and comets; the movements of the nebulas; the distance between the sun and earth; sunspots; the determination of the parallax of the sun with the transit of the Venus on\n16\nMarch\n1874\n; and one to commemorate the\n400\nth\nbirthday of\nNikolaus Copernicus\nin February\n1873\n.\nWe should also note that Scherk discovered the third non-trivial examples of a minimal surface which appeared in his paper\nBemerkungen Ã¼ber die kleinste FlÃ¤che innerhalb gegebener Grenzen\nâ\n(\nComments on the smallest area of a surface with given boundary\n)\npublished in\nCrelle's Journal\n. The first two examples, the catenoid and the helicoid\n(\nalso called the screw surface\n)\n, had been found by the Frenchman Jean Baptiste Marie Meusnier in\n1776\n. The catenoid arises from rotating the catenary curve about a horizontal line. Scherk's result was certainly seen as a major breakthough and brought him considerable fame; two surfaces, Scherk's First Surface and Scherk's Second Surface, as they are named today, are studied in the paper. Scherk's doubly periodic surface is the first example of a complete, embedded, doubly periodic minimal surface. His minimal surfaces have recently been the basis of sculptures by the American artist Brent Collins who has based many of his works on Scherk's second minimal surface.\nAnother contribution by Scherk is still important today, namely his work on the distribution of the prime numbers."
