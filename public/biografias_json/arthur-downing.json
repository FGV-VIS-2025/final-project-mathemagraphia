  "biografia": "Arthur Downing\nwas the son of Arthur Matthew Downing\n(1810\n-\n1894)\nand Mary Weld\n(1817\n-\n1894)\n. Matthew Downing, described as \"of independent means\", had married Mary Weld on\n31\nJuly\n1839\nat Rathfarnham Church, near Dublin, Ireland. Matthew and Mary Downing had five children: Samuel Forbes Downing\n(1844\n-\n1891)\n, Christina Sophia Downing\n(1849\n-\n1932)\nArthur Matthew Weld Downing\n(1850\n-\n1917)\n, the subject of this biography, Mabel H Downing\n(1853\n-\n)\n, and Bella Downing.\nDowning was educated at Nutgrove School which had been established in\n1802\nbut closed down in\n1876\nwhen the premises became a private residence. The principal of Nutgrove School at this time was Philip Jones. He graduated in\n1866\nand, in November of that year, he began studying at Trinity College, Dublin. His uncle, Samuel Downing\n(1811\n-\n1882)\n, was Professor of Engineering at Trinity College, Dublin at this time. Samuel Downing had studied at Trinity College, Dublin, graduating with a B.A. in\n1834\n, then going to Edinburgh, Scotland, where he had studied natural philosophy. Appointed as an assistant to the Professor of Engineering at Trinity College, Dublin in\n1847\n, he succeeded to the chair five years later.\nArthur Downing specialised in mathematics, was awarded a science scholarship for session\n1870\n-\n71\n, and graduated with a first-class B.A. towards the end of\n1871\n.\nJames Carpenter\n(1840\n-\n1899)\nwas an assistant to\nGeorge Airy\nat the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, and in\n1871\nco-authored the book\nThe Moon: Considered as a Planet, a World, and a Satellite\nwith the engineer James Nasmyth\n(1808\n-\n1890)\n. Carpenter resigned his position at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, shortly after publishing this book and Downing was one of those who applied to fill the vacant post. Downing was offered the position of Second Class Assistant and took up his duties at Greenwich on\n17\nJanuary\n1873\n. We note that the grade of Second Class Assistant had been created in\n1871\nand, from\n1872\n, it was filled by competitive examinations organised by the Civil Service\n[\n5\n]\n:-\nThe character of the position which he thus won was entirely congenial to him, his somewhat reserved nature and methodical habits finding satisfaction in the retired life and orderly routine of the Observatory. His mathematical tastes led him to find pleasure in computations, and during the greater part of his nineteen years at Greenwich the reductions of the Circle observations, and, later, those of the Altazimuth and Equatorial observations, were carried out by him or under his superintendence. For over ten years the care of the library and manuscripts was also in his hands, and for nearly the whole of his time at the Observatory he was one of the four regular observers with the Transit-Circle and Altazimuth.\nTwo years after he took up this position, he was elected a fellow of the\nRoyal Astronomical Society\non\n12\nMarch\n1875\n.\nOn\n13\nSeptember\n1877\n, Downing married Ellen Jane Miller at Clooney Church, Londonderry, Ireland. Ellen Jane\n(1844\n-\n1931)\nhad been born on\n1\nNovember\n1844\nin Cookstown, Tyrone, Ireland, the daughter of the solicitor Robert Miller\n(1806\n-\n1865)\nand Marion Phillips\n(1805\n-\n1862)\n. Arthur and Ellen Jane Downing had one child, a daughter Mabel Katherine Downing who was baptised on\n21\nAugust\n1878\nin Greenwich. Mabel Katherine Downing married the medical doctor Arthur Forbes Elliott in\n1904\n.\nDowning began publishing papers in\n1877\nand by the following year had around a dozen notes and papers in print. These include:\nA Determination of the Semi-diameter of Venus at the mean distance of the Sun from the Earth\n(1877)\n;\nThe Proper Motions of certain Stars in the Greenwich Seven-Year Catalogue for\n1864\n(1878)\n;\nOn the Probable Errors of Transits of the First and Second Limbs of the Sun, observed by the Chronographic Method\n(1878)\n;\nThe Proper Motions of the Edinburgh Star Catalogue\n(1878)\n;\nThe Pulkowa double star observations\n(\nPart\n1\nand Part\n2)\n(1878)\n. For short extracts from these five publications, see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nLet us make two observations. The first is that he writes from two different addresses, namely\n22\nWaterloo Road, Dublin and\n3\nPark Terrace, Greenwich. Our second observation is to remark how the young astronomer, just starting out on his career, is prepared to praise or criticise leading astronomers. For example he gives much praise to Otto Struve\n(1819\n-\n1905)\ncalling him \"the able and energetic Director of the Imperial Observatory at Pulkowa\" but Piazzi Smyth\n(1819\n-\n1900)\n, the Astronomer Royal for Scotland, is heavily criticised with Downing writing, \"If these are fair samples of Professor Smyth's work it appears that much reliance cannot be placed on it, ...\" The authors of\n[\n5\n]\nwrite:-\nA series of more than thirty papers followed, dealing with the comparison of star places in different catalogues, their correction for systematic errors, the computation of proper motions, and other inquiries important in fundamental astronomy. These won him a reputation as an able and conscientious worker in this essential but less popular side of the science ...\nDowning was promoted to First Class Assistant at the Royal Observatory on\n15\nAugust\n1881\n. He was editor of the\nObservatory\nfrom\n1885\nto\n1887\n, carrying out this role for volumes,\n8\n,\n9\nand\n10\n. He also held important roles in the\nRoyal Astronomical Society\n, serving nineteen years on the Council, being secretary from\n1889\nto\n1892\nand vice-president in\n1890\n-\n91\n. He was also a founder member of the British Astronomical Association and we should say a little about how and why that organisation was founded.\nThe\nRoyal Astronomical Society\nhad been funded in\n1820\nbut it was not a Society for everyone interested in astronomy. It charged a high subscription, it tended to publish highly technical papers and it was not open to women. There were other astronomical societies, for example the Liverpool Astronomical Society founded in\n1881\nbut, although it had a very positive beginning, it soon declined. Elizabeth Brown\n(1830\n-\n1899)\n, who specialised in solar astronomy, was a member of the Liverpool Astronomical Society but had to make a\n140\nmile round journey to attend meetings. She wrote many times to Edward Walter Maunder\n(1851\n-\n1928)\nwho was a colleague of Downing at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich encouraging him to consider setting up a new astronomical society. Maunder and Downing discussed the idea. Further impetus came from a letter in July\n1890\nfrom William Henry Stanley Monck toÂ\nThe English Mechanic\n, in which he proposed the setting up of an association of amateur astronomers for those excluded from the Royal Astronomical Society. Many people showed interest in the idea and when the first meeting was held in the Hall of the Society of Arts, John Street, Westminster, London on\n24\nOctober\n1890\nit was announced that the British Astronomical Association already had\n283\nmembers. Sixty people attended this first meeting when the Association declared its aim to be\n[\n9\n]\n:-\nThe association of observers, especially the possessors of small telescopes, for mutual help, and their organisation in the work of astronomical observation, the circulation of current astronomical information, and the encouragement of popular interest in astronomy.\nDowning was elected Vice-President at this first meeting and, two years later in\n1892\n, he was elected President of the British Astronomical Association, becoming its second president. One of the lectures that Downing delivered to the Association when he became President was \"How to find Easter.\" You can read a version of his lecture at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nHe also wrote an article on the International Date Line called\nWhen the day changes\n, that you can see at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nHe continued to play a very active role in the Association, and remained a member of its council for many years. The Association decided to make their first eclipse expedition to VadsÃ¶ in Norway to study the total eclipse which was to take place on\n9\nAugust\n1896\n. Downing was the secretary and organiser of the expedition and, before setting out, many meetings were held to make the necessary arrangements. Downing was one of the\n58\nmembers who sailed from Tilbury on\n25\nJuly on the\nNorse King\naiming to reach VadsÃ¶, a small fishing station, on Varanger Fjord. The party prepared for the eclipse on the journey. A formal meeting of the British Astronomical Association was held on board the\nNorse King\non\n28\nJuly with Maunder, at that time President of the Association, in the chair and Downing as Secretary. On\n2\nAugust they set up camp on a small island opposite VadsÃ¶, carried out a rehearsal for the eclipse on\n7\nAugust when the weather was glorious but sadly\n9\nAugust was cloudy. No data could be gathered but not all had been lost since members of the Association had been able to work and plan together in a way that had not happened before. Downing's excellent organising had played an important part.\nBy the time Downing was organising the eclipse expedition he had changed his job. On\n1\nJanuary of\n1892\nhe left his position at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich to take up the position of Superintendent of the Nautical Almanac. His role in this position is described clearly in\n[\n5\n]\nand so we give an extended quote from that obituary:-\nHere began his real life-work, for which his natural bent, his education at Dublin, and his experience at Greenwich had admirably fitted him. The quiet, withdrawn, old-world corner of Gray's Inn, the responsible routine of the computations for the \"Seaman's Bible,\" varying so little from one year to another, were exactly fitted to his temperament. Of undoubted ability, shrewd, determined, and far-seeing, and possessed of a great amount of energy, the Nautical Almanac was in safe keeping in his hands, and during the years he held the post his mental alertness suggested a number of alterations and improvements which he carried out most successfully. In particular he greatly increased the number of \"Nautical Almanac Stars,\" earning thereby the gratitude alike of astronomers, seamen, and surveyors. Under his hand also additions were made to the section of planetary satellites, and physical ephemerides of the planets were introduced. On the other hand, he witnessed the demise of \"lunar distances,\" that hoary method that had well served its day and generation.\nMethodical himself in all his work, punctilious and careful, cautious and straightforward in all official matters, he set the highest value on the work of his staff, and as a trained, practical observer knew how to insist on the need for extreme accuracy throughout the various calculations. To his knowledge of mathematics he added decided skill in computation, but although he was less liable than most men to make mistakes, he in no case allowed himself to dispense with the most scrupulous revision of any work that he had in hand. His extensive command of dates and figures did not, however, always save him from an occasional blunder, and it was a joke against him that on one occasion he \"dated a cheque two years ahead, the cheque coming back with a notification that it was post-dated. After all, it was a natural mistake for one to make whose main work was wholly devoted to events due to occur some years ahead.\nIn addition to his strictly official work, the queries that were showered upon him were many and varied, relating to chronology, the calendar, eclipses, astronomical constants, the construction of the Nautical Almanac, and kindred matters. One inquirer perhaps wanted to know the exact time of some full moon of a century ago; another, its age on the night of the Gunpowder Plot. Or such inquiries might be made of him as, \"What was the time of high water at Dover when Julius Caesar landed in August\n55\nB.C.?\" Every inquiry of a sensible character received prompt attention, and even faddists and cranks were kindly dealt with when their peculiarities were confined within certain prescribed limits.\nAn extensive piece of work which occupied seven years of his official life was his revision of Taylor's General Catalogue of\n11\n,\n000\nStars for the Equinox,\n1835\n.\n0\n, from Observations made at Madras Observatory,\n1831\nto\n1842\n. This work was a natural sequel to the numerous and important contributions he had made in previous years to this branch of sidereal astronomy. In his preface he says \"That his\n(\nTaylor's\n)\nwork may now be rendered more useful to astronomy is the reward for which I hope in the publication of this revised edition,\" and that aim and hope illustrate the keynote of his character. He found the question of the expected reappearance of the Leonids an interesting and profitable study for several years, during which he collaborated with the late Dr Johnstone Stoney in an attempt to construct an ephemeris of the densest portion of the swarm. The calculations appertaining to this were made at H.M. Nautical Almanac Office under his superintendence, and went to show that the failure of the shower to reappear at the end of last century was probably due to the perturbations of the meteors by the action of Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus, while the meteors were travelling at a great distance from the Sun. The main body of the swarm was thus made to pass at a distance of nearly\n1\n3\n4\n1\\large\\frac{3}{4}\\normalsize\n1\n4\n3\nâ\nmillions of miles from the Earth's orbit.\nDowning's term of office at Gray's Inn was marked by special efforts at cooperation between similar departments in other countries with the view of avoiding duplication of work, and led to the holding in Paris, in\n1896\nMay, of an International Conference on Fundamental Stars, and the results of the Conference, the inauguration of which was due to him, were far-reaching.\nIn later years illness troubled Dr Downing considerably and appeared to intensify his natural reserve. He retired from the Nautical Almanac in\n1910\non completing the sixtieth year of his age. It is the testimony of a member of his staff who was with him throughout the years of his Superintendency, that \"he was at all times fair, courteous, and considerate; he always consulted the interests of his staff, and was in every worthy movement a sympathetic helper.\"\nDowning was elected a fellow of the\nRoyal Society\nin\n1896\n. The citation for his election by his proposers E J Stone; W H M Christie; W J L Wharton; Rosse;\nRobert S Ball\n; J F Tennant; W Huggins; W de W Abney;\nA Cayley\n;\nJ W L Glaisher\n; J R Hind;\nS Roberts\n; W Ellis; and\nG H Darwin\n, reads\n[\n7\n]\n:-\nVice-President of the\nRoyal Astronomical Society\n. President of the British Astronomical Association. Superintendent of the Nature Almanac. Author of the following papers, among many others, which have appeared in the 'Monthly Notices' of the\nRoyal Astronomical Society\n: - 'Proper Motions of Certain Stars in the Greenwich Seven Catalogue for\n1860\n'\n(\nvol xl, p\n85)\n; 'The Greenwich Standard Right Ascensions'\n(\nvol xl, p\n430)\n; 'The Possible Ten-month Period of Variation in Latitude'\n(\nvol xl, p\n430)\n; 'On the NPD's of the Cape Catalogue for\n1880\n, and on the Greenwich and Cape Mean Systems of North Polar Distances'\n(\nvol xlii, p\n20)\n; 'Discussion of the Observations of gamma Draconis, made with the Greenwich Reflex Zenith Tube, during the years\n1857\n-\n1875\n'\n(\nvol xlii, p\n326)\n; 'On the relative Motion of the Components of 'p' Eridani\n(\nvol xliii, p\n263)\n; 'On the Orbit of gamma Coronae Australis'\n(\nvol xliii, p\n368)\n; 'On the Periodic Time of alpha Centauri'\n(\nvol xlv, p\n151)\n; 'A Comparison of the Star Places of the Argentine General Catalogue for\n1875\nwith those of the Cape Catalogue,\n1880\n'\n(\nvol xlvii, p\n446)\n; 'Positions for\n1750\nand Proper Motions of\n154\nStars, S of -\n29\ndegrees dec, from a revision of Powalky's Reduction of the Star Places of Lacaille's Astronomiae Fundamenta'\n(\nvol xlviii, p\n322)\n; 'Discussion of Washington Observations of the Sun,\n1875\n-\n1883\n'\n(\nvol xlix, p\n431)\n; 'Corrections to the Orbit of Juno'\n(\nvol\n1\n, p\n487)\n; 'The Orbit of Flora, with corrections to Brunnow's Tafeln der Flora'\n(\nvol lii, p\n585)\n.\nIn addition to the honours already described, such as election to the\nRoyal Society\n, he was elected a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society and, in\n1893\n, Trinity College, Dublin awarded him the honorary degree of Doctor of Science.\nDowning retired from his position as Superintendent of the Nautical Almanac on\n13\nApril\n1910\n; retirement was required at the age of sixty. His years of retirement, however, were not ones which he was fully able to enjoy since he was troubled by a recurring heart condition. He died suddenly and was cremated at Golders Green crematorium on\n13\nDecember\n1917\n.\nThe obituary\n[\n5\n]\nends with the following assessment of his contributions:-\nReviewing Dr Downing's career as a whole, it might be summed up by saying that the talents he displayed were sober and solid rather than brilliant, but the useful work which he accomplished entitles him to an honourable place among professional astronomers."
