  "biografia": "Roberto VÃ¡zquez GarciÃ¡\nwas the son of Enrique Feliciano VÃ¡zquez Espinosa\n(1879\n-\n1941)\nand Dolores Garcia VÃ¡zquez\n(1886\n-\n)\n. Roberto had the siblings Leonila VÃ¡zquez GarcÃ­a, Raquel VÃ¡zquez GarcÃ­a and Eugenia VÃ¡zquez GarcÃ­a.\nHe began his primary studies in\n1924\nat the \"GalaciÃ³n GÃ³mez\" junior school in the CuauhtÃ©moc district of Mexico City. He continued his studies at the \"El Pensador Mexicano\" school graduating in\n1928\n. His secondary studies continued at Secondary School number\n4\nbetween\n1929\nand\n1931\n. Certainly Roberto excelled at school, showing particular talents in mathematics. What is less clear is whether he enjoyed his school days. Certainly in later life he said that he regarded his school days as a huge waste of time. He said that state education around\n1930\nin Mexico was a shameless farce of colossal dimensions and it had improved little over the years. He certainly was not being critical of his teachers for he considered many of them to be excellent but rather it was the system that he was critical of.\nHe attended the National Preparatory School in\n1932\nand studied there until\n1933\n. This school, originally a Jesuit College in the centre of Mexico City, had been taken over by the government in\n1868\nand brought pupils up to the standard required for entering the Universidad Nacional AutÃ³noma de MÃ©xico. At this school he was taught by\nAlfonso NÃ¡poles GÃ¡ndara\nwho had been appointed head of mathematics there in\n1926\nbut had spent the years\n1930\n-\n32\nat the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\nIn\n1934\n, VÃ¡zquez entered the National School of Engineers. Although he was keen to study mathematics, at this time the only way to do this in Mexico was to take an engineering degree. Things were beginning to change, however, at about this time and moves were being made towards introducing degrees in mathematics.\nJosÃ© Adem\nexplains in\n[\n5\n]\nthat when\nNÃ¡poles GÃ¡ndara\nreturned from studying in the United States, he taught high level mathematics courses:-\nThe lectures that\nNÃ¡poles GÃ¡ndara\ngave upon his return became the main basis for training a group of young higher mathematics teachers who would later constitute the physical-mathematical faculty of our Faculty of Sciences.\nJosÃ© Adem\nexplained how mathematics developed in Mexico providing an environment which allowed VÃ¡zquez to train as a mathematician\n[\n5\n]\n:-\nParallel to teaching, research began to be organised when in\n1932\n, and at the initiative of a group headed by\nSotera Prieto\n,\nNÃ¡poles GÃ¡ndara\n, Jorge Quijano and Mariano HernÃ¡ndez, the Section of Mathematics and Theoretical Physics was formed at the Antonio Alzate National Academy of Sciences. The weekly sessions that were held for several years were one of the first stimuli received by mathematical research in Mexico. Several professors participated in this mathematical seminar, as well as a group of distinguished students of\nSotera Prieto\nand\nNÃ¡poles GÃ¡ndara\n.\nBoth\nAlberto Barajas\nand\nCarlos Graef\nhad, like VÃ¡zquez, began their undergraduate studies in the National School of Engineers. They were a couple of years ahead of VÃ¡zquez and, in\n1934\n, they both decided to dedicate themselves professionally to mathematics. They were a major influence on the younger VÃ¡zquez both in adding to his enthusiasm for mathematics and also for increasing his knowledge of it.\nVÃ¡zquez began teaching in\n1937\nat the National Preparatory School, where he taught for nine years,  and at the National School of Engineering where he taught for ten years.\nIt was through the efforts of\nNÃ¡poles GÃ¡ndara\nthat, towards the end of\n1938\n, the Faculty of Sciences was created in the Universidad Nacional AutÃ³noma de MÃ©xico. VÃ¡zquez moved from the School of Engineers to attend courses at the Faculty of Sciences as soon as it was set up. We quote from\nCarlos Graef\nabout the mathematical environment at the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico that VÃ¡zquez entered\n[\n3\n]\n:-\n... the Department of Physics and Mathematics was located in the Palacio de MinerÃ­a, home to the School of Engineers. The neighbourhood in the space of the two establishments was very fruitful. The professors in the Physics and Mathematics department were professors from the School of Engineering who had a special love for exact sciences. Those who were then dedicated to teaching these subjects had to give many hours of class every day to be able to collect a decent remuneration. There was no physics or mathematics institute, and the only income for them was from their teaching work.\nVÃ¡zquez completed his studies in\n1939\n, but the Faculty of Sciences had not at that time received the right to award degrees so VÃ¡zquez graduated with the degree of Master of Science in\n1941\nwith the thesis\nConjuntos Limites\nâ\n(\nLimit sets\n)\n. The first courses he taught at the Faculty of Sciences were\nTheory of Functions of Real Variables\n,\nMathematical Analysis I\n, and\nMathematical Analysis II\n. A scholarship from the Rockefeller Foundation allowed him to spend two years at Princeton University. There he took courses given by\nHermann Weyl\nand began undertaking research with the aim of submitting a Ph.D. thesis to Princeton.\nSolomon Bochner\nsuggested a topic for VÃ¡zquez to study and, not surprisingly, he suggesting problems associated with the work he was thinking about at the time.\nBochner\nhad published\nHilbert distances and positive definite functions\nin\n1941\nand was working on the paper\nCompletely monotone functions in partially ordered spaces\nwhich was published in\n1942\n. VÃ¡zquez's scholarship was only for two years and was not specifically to allow him to obtain a Ph.D., so he had to return to Mexico City in\n1943\n. His intention at the time was, however, to complete work on his thesis and, in due course, to submit it to Princeton.\nShortly after VÃ¡zquez returned to Mexico City, on\n30\nJune\n1943\nthe\nMexican Mathematical Society\nwas founded there. It initially consisted of\n131\nfounding members, one of these being VÃ¡zquez. The Instituto MatemÃ¡ticas of the Universidad Nacional AutÃ³noma de MÃ©xico was founded on\n30\nJune\n1942\nand\nNÃ¡poles GandÃ¡ra\nwas appointed as its first director. VÃ¡zquez joined the Institute of Mathematics on his return in\n1943\nand rapidly became involved in its activities. The Institute of Mathematics began to operate in the Palacio de MinerÃ­a, in the historic centre of Mexico City. The building also housed the National School of Engineers and the recently founded Faculty of Sciences. The Institute was subdivided into three areas: Pure Mathematics, led by\nAlberto Barajas\nand Roberto VÃ¡zquez, Applied Mathematics, led by\nCarlos Graef\n, and Logic and Fundamentals led by Francisco Zubieta. These four young researchers and the director\nAlfonso NÃ¡poles GÃ¡ndara\nwere the only members of the Institute's academic staff in the first few years of its existence.\nIn\n1944\n,\nGeorge David Birkhoff\nmade one of his regular visits to the Institute of Mathematics to encourage research activities. In addition to working to complete his thesis, VÃ¡zquez began undertaking research on problems proposed by\nG D Birkhoff\n. Collaborating with Francisco Zubieta Russi, VÃ¡zquez published jointly authored articles such as\nThe linear homogeneous continua of George D Birkhoff\n(\nSpanish\n)\nand\nNote on the continuum\n(\nSpanish\n)\nin the first volume of the\nBulletin\nof the\nMexican Mathematical Society\nin\n1944\n. He also published the single authored article\nHypersurfaces with width\n(\nSpanish\n)\nin the second volume of the\nBulletin\nof the\nMexican Mathematical Society\nin\n1945\n.\nIn addition to undertaking joint research activities with his colleague Francisco Zubieta Russi from the Institute of Mathematics, VÃ¡zquez also did joint work with Javier Barros Sierra, who worked in the National School of Engineering. Javier Barros Sierra\n(1915\n-\n1971)\nhad studied civil engineering at the Universidad Nacional AutÃ³noma de MÃ©xico and taught for many years both at the National Preparatory School and in the National School of Engineering. Looking at another problem posed by\nG D Birkhoff\n, VÃ¡zquez and Barros published the joint paper\nTheorems on geodesic circles and the Gaussian curvature\n(\nSpanish\n)\nin the third volume of the\nBulletin\nof the\nMexican Mathematical Society\nin\n1946\n. You can see a list of papers published by VÃ¡zquez at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nVÃ¡zquez also wrote, with co-author Javier Barros Sierra, the textbook\nIntroducciÃ³n al cÃ¡lculo diferencial e integral\nâ\n(\nIntroduction to differential and integral calculus\n)\nwhich was first published in\n1946\n. A second edition was published in\n1958\nand, since the book enjoyed a continued popularity, by\n1973\na fifth edition had appeared\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nIt is worth mentioning about this book that, from its first edition, it became the text par excellence not only for the corresponding subject in the National Preparatory School but also for the first courses of this subject taught in faculties such as Engineering, Chemical Sciences and Sciences.\nG D Birkhoff\ndied in November\n1944\nand\nSolomon Lefschetz\ntook over his role in encouraging research at the Institute of Mathematics in Mexico City.\nLefschetz\nwas keen that VÃ¡zquez should return to Princeton and present his completed thesis for a Princeton Ph.D. This, however, proved impossible since VÃ¡zquez did not have funds to pay the fare and accommodation costs. Partly this was because he had just got married: he had married Isabel LandÃ¡zuri Prieto on\n11\nAugust\n1944\n. Isabel had been born in Mexico City on\n14\nOctober\n1920\nto civil engineer RaÃºl LandÃ¡zuri and his wife Teresa Prieto. Roberto and Isabel had three children: RaÃºl VÃ¡zquez LandÃ¡zuri\n(\nborn\n8\nJuly\n1945)\n; Isabel VÃ¡zquez LandÃ¡zuri\n(\nborn\n30\nMay\n1947)\nand RocÃ­o VÃ¡zquez LandÃ¡zuri.\nUnable to afford going to Princeton to complete all the necessary procedures to earn his Ph.D., VÃ¡zquez decided to submit his thesis to the Universidad Nacional AutÃ³noma de MÃ©xico which now had the right to award doctorates. The thesis,\nFunciones Definitivamente Positivas en Espacios Parcialmente Ordenados\nâ\n(\nPositive definite functions in partially ordered spaces\n)\n, already had the approval of\nSolomon Bochner\n, so acceptance was straightforward. He was awarded the Ph.D. in\n1947\nbecoming the first person to be awarded a Ph.D. in mathematics from the Universidad Nacional AutÃ³noma de MÃ©xico. VÃ¡zquez's research had been in functional analysis and differential geometry but, influenced by\nLefschetz\n's lectures on topology, he became interested in research in that topic.\nLefschetz\nwrote in\n[\n7\n]\nabout his interactions with the mathematicians in Mexico City:-\nIn\n1944\nI joined as a part-time connection the Instituto de Mathematicas at the National University of Mexico. This continued until\n1966\n. At the Instituto I was as free as under my Princeton professorship. I conducted seminars in topology and differential equations, gave a couple of times a \"volunteer\" course on \"general mathematical concepts\" directed at beginners and, thanks to a good working library, was able to continue research.\nAlthough VÃ¡zquez began research in topology, he did not at that time have Mexican colleagues working on the topic so he worked alone and only published one paper on topology in the ten years between\n1947\nto\n1956\n. We know he was working on the topic since, in\n1951\n, he presented the paper\nThree notes on cohomology groups\nto the Mexican Scientific Congress. He spent\n1953\n-\n54\nas a visiting professor at Princeton University where he increased his knowledge of topology. The International Congress of Mathematicians was held in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, from\n2\nSeptember to\n9\nSeptember\n1954\n. The Instituto de Mathematicas in Mexico City was represented at the Congress by\nJosÃ© Adem ChahÃ­n\n,\nAlfonso NÃ¡poles y GÃ¡ndara\n, Roberto VÃ¡zquez GarcÃ­a and Emilio Lluis Riera. Emilio Lluis Riera\n(1925\n-\n2020)\nhad a bachelor's and master's degree from the Universidad Nacional AutÃ³noma de MÃ©xico and then worked for a Ph.D. at the new Ciudad Universitaria Mexico.\nVÃ¡zquez was one of eight organisers of the 'International Symposium on Algebraic Topology' held in Mexico City at the National Autonomous University of Mexico in August\n1956\nin memory of\nWitold Hurewicz\n. The other seven organisers were\nJosÃ© Adem\n,\nAlberto Barajas\n,\nSolomon Lefschetz\n, Emilio Lluis,\nAlfonso NÃ¡poles GÃ¡ndara\n,\nFÃ©lix Recillas\nand Guillermo Torres. The papers at this Symposium were given by the world's leading topologists, including:\nHenri Cartan\n,\nSamuel Eilenberg\n,\nJean-Pierre Serre\n,\nRenÃ© Thom\n,\nDonald Spencer\n,\nMichael Atiyah\n,\nShiing-shen Chern\n,\nJohn Milnor\n,\nFriedrich Hirzebruch\n,\nNorman Steenrod\n,\nIoan James\n,\nHenry Whitehead\n,\nEdwin Spanier\n,\nPeter Hilton\n,\nRaoul Bott\n,\nHans Samelson\n,\nHassler Whitney\nand\nJames Eells\n. This meeting with lectures by the world's leading topologists presented a remarkable opportunity to VÃ¡zquez.\nIn\n1959\nhe travelled to France as an Exchange Researcher, remaining there until February\n1960\n. While there he attended the\nHenri Cartan\nSeminar at the\nHenri PoincarÃ©\nInstitute. The\nAnales del Instituto de MatemÃ¡ticas\nbegan publication in\n1961\nwith VÃ¡zquez as a member of the Editorial Board from Volume\n1\n. He remained on the Editorial Board until\n1984\nwhen he was still an editor of Volume\n24\n.\nWe quote from\n[\n8\n]\nconcerning a major change in the direction of VÃ¡zquez's research, beginning in the\n1960\ns:-\nIn the\n1960\ns, there was a shift in his research work, prompted, among other things, by a seminar organised at the Institute of Mathematics, in which\nJosÃ© Adem\nand\nFÃ©lix Recillas\nparticipated, and in which the homological algebra book of\nCartan\nand\nEilenberg\nwas studied. It was then that VÃ¡zquez began to study problems about projective modules and flat modules, and began to head towards the branch of categorical topology, of which he is one of the creators ... It is in this branch that his most important production is framed, especially highlighting the categorical conceptualisation of the connectedness property, which extends from geometric objects to arbitrary objects in a connection category. Of importance at this stage was his collaboration with the brilliant mathematician\nGraciela Salicrup\n, who died as a result of a tragic accident. She wrote her undergraduate thesis with Dr VÃ¡zquez and later began a joint research project with him, part of which gave rise to the thesis with which she obtained her doctorate. Their joint research continued for several years, yielding important results in connection theory.\nHorst Herrlich\n(1937\n-\n2015)\n, also a pioneer of categorical topology, was Professor of Mathematics at the University of Bremen from\n1971\n. He writes about the joint work of VÃ¡zquez and\nGraciela Salicrup\nexplaining that they\n[\n4\n]\n:-\n... were among the first mathematicians who realised thatÂ certain topological concepts and constructions were best understood in the light of category theory. ... they analysed topological problems by means of categorical terms and methods, in many cases having first to develop the yet missing categorical machinery. For nearly a decade they produced roughly one joint paper per year, evincing a high sensitivity for suitable problems, and demonstrating great originality and skill. Their best papers of this period ... are prominent achievements in the newly emerging field of categorical topology. Unfortunately they published their results in a journal neither well known nor easily accessible in the non-Spanish speaking mathematical world. Thus, their work which otherwise would have had a considerable impact on categorical topologists - remained for a long time almost unknown, and several of their results had to be recovered independently by later investigators.\nIn fact VÃ¡zquez wrote eleven papers between\n1970\nand\n1979\n, all being joint with\nGraciela Salicrup\n. Their joint paper\nConnection categories\nwas published in\n1972\n.\nVÃ¡zquez lectured on topology for his whole career after he began research on the topic. Of course he taught other topics but it was his beautifully presented lectures on topology, together with his work as a thesis advisor, which was the main influence in building a strong Mexican research group in the subject. His lectures were very formal affairs, well organised and presented. One of his students wrote\n[\n12\n]\n:-\nThe truth is that he never dictated an agenda to us or pointed out long-term objectives. From the first day that I found myself in the student-teacher relationship with him, I learned topology; precisely the definition of this illustrated with examples. When he took us on trust, sometimes the most he would say to us when starting a topic was: \"we're going to be in this as far as we go.\"\nHe appeared to his students as rather humourless but his friends commented on his keen sense of humour and a certain irony in his vision of the world around him. His life seemed completely dominated by mathematics but he enjoyed baroque music and had a great love of animals.\nAlfonso NÃ¡poles GÃ¡ndara\nwas the first director of the Institute of Mathematics, then in\n1966\nVÃ¡zquez replaced him holding this position until\n1972\n. In\n1984\nVÃ¡zquez retired and was made an Emeritus Researcher. He continued to undertake research and had five papers published between\n1985\nand\n1992\n. He never stopped working even in his final illness and while at home, hoping his health would improve, he wrote six manuscripts. His writing had deteriorated by the time he wrote the last two suggesting that by this time his hand must have trembled. His mind, however, remained clear and the mathematics looked good quality.\nOn\n25\nFebruary\n1994\nthe\nMexican Mathematical Society\norganised a meeting to pay a tribute to VÃ¡zquez\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nMany of us attended with the hope of seeing him, but his delicate health prevented him from going and his daughter Isabel attended in his place. A toast was made in his honour, music was played\n(\nthere was a flute, and there was also a guitar\n)\n, a pretty young lady sang old songs in French, speeches were made ... We never saw him again.\nLet us note that his excellent contributions were recognised with the award of the  \"Luis Elizondo\" Scientific Prize in\n1986\n:-\nThe TecnolÃ³gico de Monterrey Luis Elizondo Award for a Humanistic Outlook was established in\n1967\nwith a personal contribution from Don Luis to TecnolÃ³gico de Monterrey. The award recognises prestigious researchers who have worked for the benefit of Mexico, as well as people and institutions who have devoted their humanitarian, fraternal work to their fellow human beings, have performed outstanding scientific and technological activity and carry out their philanthropic work in the Mexican community, all of whom have profiles similar to that of the Nuevo LeÃ³n philanthropist, Don Luis Elizondo.\nHe was also awarded the prize for Exact Science Research by the National Autonomous University of Mexico in\n1989\n.\nFinally let us note that in some ways the career of Roberto VÃ¡zquez was different from that of most university professors. He wrote an outstanding undergraduate level textbook when he was around\n30\nyears of age, yet despite its continuing popularity and many editions, he never wrote another undergraduate textbook. It is also unusual that his most important research contributions were made when he was in his late\n50\ns and early\n60\ns."
