  "biografia": "Little is known about\nYang Hui\nother than that he wrote several outstanding mathematical texts. He was a contemporary of both\nQin Jiushao\nand\nLi Zhi\n, which we know from the dates on which his texts appeared, showing that he lived towards the end of the Nan\n(\nSouthern\n)\nSung dynasty. However, both\nQin\nand\nLi\n's major works appeared about fifteen years before the first work of Yang.\nZhu Shijie\nwas only born about the time Yang Hui's first texts were appearing so his life also overlapped that of Yang.\nThere is a small amount of information about Yang Hui which he relates in his books. He tells us that he was taught mathematics by Liu I who was a native of Chung-shan, in Kwangtung province, which is south of Chekiang province where Yang Hui was born. Nothing at all is known of Liu I, so this information is less helpful in giving us details of Yang Hui than it might be. Again we know the names of four of Yang's friends who were also interested in mathematics, but again as these men are unknown except for Yang's reference to them. The best guess that historians make is that Yang was a minor Chinese official. Most Chinese scholars of the period were officials, for there were no professional mathematicians, but he could not have held an important post since were he a major official he would appear in records of the dynasty. I\n[\nEFR\n]\nam less certain about this standard view.\nI base my argument on the style and content of Yang's books, for it is clear from these that he was an experienced teacher. More than this, he is writing as a teacher trying to find the most interesting and helpful explanation. Any teacher of mathematics today can identify with what Yang is trying to do here. Of course, this in no way proves that the view of Yang as a minor official is false, indeed he could be an official with responsibility for teaching mathematics, but I suggest that it is more likely that he was an active teacher of mathematics who would have had a group of young students around him.\nIn\n1261\nYang wrote the\nXiangjie jiuzhang suanfa\n(\nDetailed analysis of the mathematical rules in the\nNine Chapters\nand their reclassifications\n)\n. He tells us that he had obtained a fine edition of the\nNine Chapters on the Mathematical Art\nwhich contained notes by\nJia Xian\non the edition commented on by\nLiu Hui\nand later by\nLi Chunfeng\n. The notes by\nJia Xian\nhave not survived so we know of them only through the references from Yang. What Yang produced was not intended to be a further commentary on the ancient classic but instead he selected\n80\nof the\n246\nproblems for his discussion. He chose these\n80\nsince he felt that they were representatives of the different techniques which were presented in the\nNine Chapters\n.\nYang's\nDetailed analysis\ncontained twelve chapters. Nine of the twelve correspond to those of the\nNine Chapters\nbut there are three further chapters: one containing geometrical figures, one containing the fundamental methods, and one in which Yang presents a new classification of the problems. Each problem is studied by Yang for three different aspects. Firstly he explains the logic behind the problem, secondly he gives a numerical solution to the problem, and thirdly he shows how the method he has presented can be modified to solve similar problems. For example, if the problem reduced to the solution of a quadratic equation, then Yang would solve it numerically, then show how to solve a general quadratic equation numerically.\nProblem\n16\nin Chapter\n7\nof the\nNine Chapters\nis as follows:-\nNow\n1\ncubic cun of jade weighs\n7\nliang, and\n1\ncubic cun of rock weighs\n6\nliang. Now there is a cube of side\n3\ncun consisting of a mixture of jade and rock which weighs\n11\njin. Tell: what are the weights of jade and rock in the cube.\n[\nNote\n1\njin =\n16\nliang\n]\nIf there are\nx\nx\nx\ncubic cun of jade and\ny\ny\ny\ncubic cun of rock in the cube then\nx\n+\ny\n=\n27\n7\nx\n+\n6\ny\n=\n176\nx + y = 27\\newline7x + 6y = 176\nx\n+\ny\n=\n2\n7\n7\nx\n+\n6\ny\n=\n1\n7\n6\nAlthough Yang has presented a problem straight from the\nNine Chapters\nhis method of solution is quite different. What Yang's method essentially reduces to is finding the\ndeterminant\nof the matrix of coefficients of the system of equations. Of course he gets the same answer as the earlier authors and commentators, namely that the cube contains\n14\ncubic cun of jade weighing\n6\njin\n2\nliang, and\n13\ncubic cun of rock weighing\n4\njin\n14\nliang.\nThere is other work in Yang's\nDetailed analysis\nthat we should single out for a mention. He gives what today is called\nPascal's triangle\n, up to the sixth row, saying that he learnt it from\nJia Xian\n's treatise. Yang also gave formulae for the sum of certain series, for example he found the sum of the squares of the natural numbers from\nm\n2\nm^{2}\nm\n2\nto\n(\nm\n+\nn\n)\n2\n(m+n)^{2}\n(\nm\n+\nn\n)\n2\nand showed that\n1\n+\n3\n+\n6\n+\n.\n.\n.\n+\n1\n2\nn\n(\nn\n+\n1\n)\n=\n1\n6\nn\n(\nn\n+\n1\n)\n(\nn\n+\n2\n)\n1 + 3 + 6 + ... + \\large\\frac{1}{2}\\normalsize n(n + 1) = \\large\\frac{1}{6}\\normalsize n(n + 1)(n + 2)\n1\n+\n3\n+\n6\n+\n.\n.\n.\n+\n2\n1\nâ\nn\n(\nn\n+\n1\n)\n=\n6\n1\nâ\nn\n(\nn\n+\n1\n)\n(\nn\n+\n2\n)\n.\nSee\n[\n14\n]\nfor a discussion of the geometrical ideas which lie behind Yang's approach to summing series.\nA year after producing\nDetailed analysis\nYang wrote\nRiyong suanfa\n(\nMathematics for everyday use\n)\n. Although the text of this has been lost, we know enough about it from quotes in other works to know that it was an elementary text. Yang says that he wrote it:-\n... to assist the reader with the numerous matters of daily use and also to instruct the young in observation and practice.\nIn\n[\n19\n]\nsome of the quotes which allow a partial reconstruction of this work are translated into English. In his text Yang explained:-\n... the additive method of multiplication and the subtractive method of division\n[\nrelative to the\n]\nten problems and their solutions.\nOver the next years Yang must have continued to produce material for mathematics texts but he published nothing more until\n1274\nwhen\nCheng Chu Tong Bian Ben Mo\nwhich means\nAlpha and omega of variations on multiplication and division\nappeared. This was a three chapter work, each chapter having its own title. The first chapter is\nFundamental changes in calculation\n, the second is\nComputational treasure for variations in multiplications and divisions\n, and the third, written in collaboration with Shih Chung-yung who was one of his friends, is\nFundamentals of the applications of mathematics\n.\nIn\n1275\ntwo further works by Yang appeared; the\nPractical mathematical rules for surveying\nand\nContinuation of ancient mathematical methods for elucidating strange properties of numbers\n, both being works of two chapters. All Yang's volumes of\n1274\nand\n1275\nwere assembled into what were essentially his collected works called\nYang Hui suanfa\n(\nYang Hui's methods of computation\n)\n. An English translation of the\nYang Hui suanfa\nappears in\n[\n3\n]\n. The topics covered by Yang include multiplication, division, root-extraction, quadratic and simultaneous equations, series, computations of areas of a rectangle, a trapezium, a circle, and other figures. He also gives a wonderful account of\nmagic squares\nand magic circles which we give more information about below.\nOne of the more remarkable aspects of this work is the document on mathematics education\nXi Suan Gang Mu\n(\nA syllabus of mathematics\n)\nwhich prefaced the first chapter of\nCheng Chu Tong Bian Ben Mo\n. Man Keung Siu, reviewing\n[\n10\n]\n, writes that the syllabus:-\n... is an important and unusual extant document in mathematics education in ancient China. Not only does it specify the content and the time-table of a comprehensive study program in mathematics, it also explains the rationale behind the design of such a curriculum. It emphasizes a systematic and coherent program that is based on real understanding rather than on rote learning. This program is a marked improvement on the traditional way of learning mathematics by which a student is assigned certain classical texts, to be studied one followed by the other, each for a period of one to two years!\nThe syllabus is a fascinating document for it shows Yang's concern that mathematics is properly taught to those meeting the subject for the first time. This was not the first time Yang had shown such concerns, for his elementary text of\n1262\nwas also clearly designed to help beginners.\nHere is a problem taken from Chapter\n2\nof\nContinuation of ancient mathematical methods for elucidating strange properties of numbers\n.\n100\ncoins buy Wenzhou oranges, green oranges, and golden oranges,\n100\nin total. If a Wenzhou orange costs\n7\ncoins, a green orange\n3\ncoins, and\n3\ngolden oranges cost\n1\ncoin, how many oranges of the three kinds will be bought?\nYang's solution is quoted in\n[\n8\n]\n:-\nFrom\n3\ntimes\n100\ncoins subtract\n100\ncoins; from\n3\ntimes the cost of a Wenzhou orange i.e.\n21\n, subtract\n1\n; the remainder is\n20\n. From\n3\ntimes the cost of a green orange, i.e.\n9\n, subtract\n1\n; the remainder is\n8\n. The sum of the remainder is\n28\n. Divide\n200\nby\n28\n, we have the integer\n6\n. These are the numbers to be found;\n6\nWenzhou oranges and\n6\ngreen oranges respectively. And then\n(200\n-\n6\nÃ\n28)\nÃ·\n8\n=\n4\n, this is the difference of the number of Wenzhou oranges and green oranges. Hence the sum of them is\n16\n, whereas the number of gold oranges to be found is\n84\n.\nWhat is Yang doing? At first sight it seems to make no sense, so let us look at how we might approach such a problem. Suppose there are\nx\nx\nx\nWenzhou oranges,\ny\ny\ny\ngreen oranges and\nz\nz\nz\ngolden oranges. Then a modern solution would set up equations\nx\n+\ny\n+\nz\n=\n100\n7\nx\n+\n3\ny\n+\n1\n3\nz\n=\n100\nx + y + z = 100\\newline7x + 3y + \\large\\frac{1}{3}\\normalsize z = 100\nx\n+\ny\n+\nz\n=\n1\n0\n0\n7\nx\n+\n3\ny\n+\n3\n1\nâ\nz\n=\n1\n0\n0\nMultiplying the second by\n3\nand putting it first gives\n21\nx\n+\n9\ny\n+\nz\n=\n300\nx\n+\ny\n+\nz\n=\n100\n21x + 9y + z = 300\\newline x + y + z = 100\n2\n1\nx\n+\n9\ny\n+\nz\n=\n3\n0\n0\nx\n+\ny\n+\nz\n=\n1\n0\n0\nNow look at Yang's explanation. He is subtracting the second equation from the first:\n300\n-\n100\ncoins,\n21\n-\n1\nWenzhou oranges,\n9\n-\n1\ngreen oranges. He gets\n20\nx\n+\n8\ny\n=\n200\n20x + 8y = 200\n2\n0\nx\n+\n8\ny\n=\n2\n0\n0\nThen let\nd\nd\nd\n, say, be the difference of the number of Wenzhou oranges and green oranges, so\ny\n=\nx\nâ\nd\ny = x - d\ny\n=\nx\nâ\nd\n. Look at Yang's explanation. This is exactly what he is doing! Replace\ny\ny\ny\nin the above equation so that\n20\nx\n+\n8\n(\nx\nâ\nd\n)\n=\n200\n20x + 8(x - d) = 200\n2\n0\nx\n+\n8\n(\nx\nâ\nd\n)\n=\n2\n0\n0\nso\n28\nx\n=\n200\nâ\n8\nd\n28x = 200 - 8d\n2\n8\nx\n=\n2\n0\n0\nâ\n8\nd\ngiving\nx\n=\n6\n+\n1\n28\n(\n32\nâ\n8\nd\n)\nx = 6 + \\large\\frac{1}{28}\\normalsize (32 - 8d)\nx\n=\n6\n+\n2\n8\n1\nâ\n(\n3\n2\nâ\n8\nd\n)\n.\nHence\nd\n=\n4\n,\nx\n=\n6\n,\ny\n=\n10\nd = 4, x = 6, y = 10\nd\n=\n4\n,\nx\n=\n6\n,\ny\n=\n1\n0\nand\n100\n-\n(6\n+\n10)\n=\n84\nwhich is the number of golden oranges.\nIf you want to try one of Yang's problems, here is another of the same type, being the first problem in Chapter\n2\n:-\nA number of pheasants and rabbits are placed together in the same cage. Thirty-five heads and ninety-four feet are counted. Find the number of pheasants and rabbits.\nFinally let us note Yang's remarkable contribution to magic squares. Firstly it is important to realise that he presents them as a good way to interest people in numbers, and he does not claim any magic properties. We have used the standard term magic square, but Yang does not use the word magic, simply calling them number diagrams. He gives a magic square of order\n3\n, two squares of order\n4\n, two squares of order\n5\n, two squares of order six, two squares of order\n7\n, two of order\n8\n, one of order nine, and one of order\n10\n.\nYang's\n3\nÃ\n3\nsquare\nÂ Â Â One of Yang's\n4\nÃ\n4\nsquaresÂ Â\nOne of Yang's\n5\nÃ\n5\nsquaresÂ Â\nÂ Â Â One of Yang's\n6\nÃ\n6\nsquaresÂ Â\nOne of Yangs\n7\nÃ\n7\nsquares is at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nOne of Yangs\n8\nÃ\n8\nsquares is at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nYangs\n9\nÃ\n9\nsquare is at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nYangs\n10\nÃ\n10\nsquare is at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nAgain Yang does not claim any originality here, and writes as if he is presenting well known facts. This said, no record of the higher order magic squares now exist in the writings of earlier Chinese mathematicians.\nAs a final arithmetical treat we give Yang's simplest magic circle.\nThe property to note here is that there are seven intersecting circles in the diagram. Each circle has a central number and four other numbers, in the north, south, east and west positions, on its circumference. Adding the central number and the four numbers on the circumference gives\n65\nfor each of the seven circles."
