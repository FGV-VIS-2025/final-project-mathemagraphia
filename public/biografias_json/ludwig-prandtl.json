  "biografia": "Ludwig Prandtl\n's parents were Alexander Prandtl\n(1840\n-\n1896)\nand Magdalena Ostermann. Alexander Prandtl was a Professor at the Agricultural College Weihenstephan in Freising. Alexander and Magdalena were married in\n1874\n, when Alexander was\n34\nyears old and Magdalena was\n18\n. Ludwig was their first child, born in his maternal grandmother's home at Hauptstrasse\n64\n; his grandmother Maria Ostermann was, by this time, a widow. Ludwig was baptised when he was exactly one week old. His father Alexander carried out research on milk production and wrote scientific papers such as\nOn the theoretically expected effect of creaming caused by centrifugal forces\n(1877)\nand\nThe effect of currents caused by heating or cooling milk\n(1879)\n. Alexander Prandtl had got to know Magdalena since he had lodged with her mother Maria Ostermann. After Ludwig was born his father set up home at Hauptstrasse\n41\n, in the same road as his mother-in-law lived. His parents had two further children; a boy born in April\n1877\nonly lived for one week and a girl born in January\n1879\nonly lived for two weeks. Ludwig was, therefore, essentially an only child with his mother suffering a number of stillbirths and miscarriages over the following years.\nA bright child, Ludwig could count to\n10\nby the time he was four years old and he could read by the age of five. He started attending elementary school in the autumn of\n1881\nwhen he was six years old. He was an outstanding pupil, coming top of the class of\n82\npupils in his first year and continuing to be ranked first throughout his elementary schooling. He began his secondary education at the\nGymnasium\nat the Freising Domberg in September\n1885\n. His mother, who suffered mentally following the deaths of her children, the stillbirths and the miscarriages, went into a psychiatric clinic in Munich in\n1888\n. After six months in the clinic she returned home but was completely bedridden. Soon she was taken into a nursing home in Neufriedheim. These unfortunate events had, of course, quite a serious impact on Ludwig during his time in secondary education. His mother, however, had a sister Marie who was unmarried and she effectively stepped into the role of mother to the young schoolboy. His father spent a lot of time with his young son and taught him much physics. Ludwig loved to sketch, particularly when on holiday in the South Tyrol, and also show considerable musical talent, having piano lessons from the age of nine.\nIn\n1888\nPrandtl was sent to the Ludwig Gymnasium in Munich. This was the second oldest Gymnasium in Munich, founded in\n1824\n. He lived in a dormitory at the school but this was not a good experience for the\n13\n-year old Prandtl who was bullied by the older boys. After one year at the school, his father decided that Prandtl should return to the Gymnasium at Freising. After two years, he returned to the Ludwig Gymnasium in Munich where now he was more able to fit in and make good friends. He excelled at Latin, Greek and particularly natural sciences. He gained much respect from his classmates. He graduated from the Gymnasium in July\n1894\nand he went to Nuremberg where he spent three months gaining practical experience working in a foundry. Returning to Munich, he entered the Technical University, the KÃ¶niglich Technische Hochschule, in the autumn of\n1894\n. He studied there for four years, attending lectures by August FÃ¶ppl\n(1854\n-\n1924)\n, Professor of Theoretical Mechanics and Graphical Statics, Sebastian Finsterwalder\n(1862\n-\n1951)\n, Professor of Mathematics, Leonhard Sohnke\n(1842\n-\n1897)\n, Professor of Physics, and Moritz SchrÃ¶ter\n(1851\n-\n1925)\n, Professor of Theoretical Mechanical Engineering. He graduated with a degree in Mechanical Engineering in\n1898\n. During his undergraduate years, both his parents died. His father, who had moved to live with his sister Anna in Dingolfing, died in March\n1896\nand his mother died two years later.\nAfter graduating, Prandtl remained at the KÃ¶niglich Technische Hochschule for a year having been appointed as an assistant to August FÃ¶ppl. In order to allow him to take up this position, FÃ¶ppl had requested that he be allowed to defer his military training. The request was allowed and Prandtl worked as FÃ¶ppl's assistant from the beginning of October\n1898\nto the end of November\n1899\n[\n4\n]\n:-\nHe not only assisted in classes, but also participated in a number of experiments and theoretical projects concerned with stability and elasticity. One of these was later to become the subject matter of his doctoral thesis.\nLudwig FÃ¶ppl, the professor's son, recalled Prandtl at this time:-\nMy first encounter with Ludwig Prandtl, which I still remember, was in\n1898\n. The twenty-three-year-old assistant to my father, August FÃ¶ppl, was invited by my parents from time to time to Sunday dinner. He also gladly stayed after dinner to drink a cup of coffee, particularly since he received motherly affection from my mother. This practical woman with a warm-hearted disposition took the young Prandtl, who was so alone and abandoned to the world without female support, under her wing from time to time. She gave him practical suggestions, which certainly provided him with valuable advice for coping with the problems of everyday life.\nPrandtl wrote his doctoral thesis\nLateral displacement phenomena, a case of unstable elastic equilibrium\nwhile working as FÃ¶ppl's assistant. It was a piece of work which he carried out without any formal thesis advisor. The topic was of his own choosing. Although he had completed his thesis by\n1899\n, the KÃ¶niglich Technische Hochschule did not have the right to award doctorates so he submitted his thesis to the University of Munich.\nFerdinand von Lindemann\nwas appointed as an examiner and the oral conducted on\n29\nJanuary\n1900\n. He was given the grade \"very good\" and graduated with his doctorate. The thesis was published in early\n1901\nat Nuremberg and Prandtl immediately sent a copy to August FÃ¶ppl. He replied to Prandtl on\n21\nFebruary\n1901\n:-\nI was very pleased with the fine piece of work which you kindly sent to me and which I immediately read from cover to cover. I was especially surprised by the detailed and circumspect discussion of all the various cases related to tilting phenomena. Before reading your dissertation, I was not aware that your study would encompass such a large range of phenomena. It is the first time that one of my students has carried out such a proficient piece of work and this gives me all the more pleasure.\nAfter working as FÃ¶ppl's assistant he had to complete his military service which had been delayed for a year. Before the award of his doctorate, Prandtl applied for a position at the\nMaschinenbaugesellschaft\nin Nuremberg where he took up a position on\n1\nJanuary\n1900\n. While in this position he was assigned a task which led him to investigate fluid flow, the first time he had worked in this topic. However, he did not work in Nuremberg for long since he was soon appointed to a professorship in mechanics at the Technische Hochschule at Hanover, the Technical University of Hanover. This came about since, when the professorship became vacant, August FÃ¶ppl had been asked to advise on who might be worthy of  being appointed. He made a number of suggestions including Prandtl. The person who was most influential in making the appointment was\nCarl Runge\nwho had been a professor at the Technische Hochschule at Hanover since\n1886\n. He was extremely impressed with Prandtl, despite his youth, and strongly advised that he be appointed. He received the offer of the position on\n21\nAugust\n1901\n. He gave up his position in Nuremberg at the end of September and moved to Hanover to take up the professorship. He became the youngest professor in Prussia.\nPrandtl continued to work on fluid flow and, within four years, he had answered the outstanding open problem regarding fluid flow with vanishing viscosity by introducing the boundary layer, or, as Prandtl described it, the friction layer on the walls of the container. He presented his remarkable result at the International Congress of Mathematicians held in Heidelberg in August\n1904\n. Before this meeting, however, he had been approached by\nFelix Klein\nwho had offered him the position of Head of the Institute for Technical Physics at the University of GÃ¶ttingen. However,\nRunge\nwas determined to keep Prandtl at Hanover and\nKarl Schwarzschild\n, having had a letter from\nRunge\n, wrote to\nKlein\nsaying that he felt there was little chance that Prandtl would accept. Prandtl was in two minds about whether to accept and\nKlein\nwrote to the Ministry in Berlin with a strong recommendation concerning Prandtl's ability\n(\nsee, for example\n[\n4\n]\n)\n:-\nPrandtl's work stands out due to the combination of his specialist knowledge and his grasp of mathematics, a marked intuitive ability and the originality of his thought. At the same time, he also has a great interest in education.\nPrandtl went to Berlin to negotiate over the offer and, after making the difficult decision, Prandtl accepted\nKlein\n's offer on\n1\nJuly\n1904\n; by the end of the month, all the paperwork had been completed. It is clear that Prandtl held\nKlein\nin high regard and this was one factor in his decision to move to GÃ¶ttingen. Indeed, after Prandtl moved to GÃ¶ttingen he became a close friend of\nKlein\n. Another factor must have been the fact that\nKlein\nalso approached\nCarl Runge\nand persuaded him to also accept a position at GÃ¶ttingen.\nAlthough GÃ¶ttingen provided Prandtl with outstanding research opportunities, he was less happy with the teaching duties he was asked to perform. Therefore when he was approached by the Technical University Stuttgart and offered a full professorship, he used this to persuade the ministry to give him a full professorship at GÃ¶ttingen. At GÃ¶ttingen, in\n1907\n, he organised the setting up of a wind tunnel where he could carry out practical results and it was constructed in the following year. By\n1909\nhe had been given:-\n... responsibility for the whole area of scientific aeronautics in both lectures and practical courses.\nPrandtl had kept up his friendship with August FÃ¶ppl and FÃ¶ppl's son Ludwig came to GÃ¶ttingen in\n1908\nto take courses by\nDavid Hilbert\n,\nFelix Klein\n, Prandtl and\nRunge\n. In December of that year, Ludwig told Prandtl that his sister Gertrud was soon to be engaged. Ludwig later said how sad Prandtl looked to receive this news. However, Prandtl received a letter from August FÃ¶ppl shortly after the New Year telling him that Gertrud's engagement had been broken off soon after it was announced. In January\n1909\nanother of August FÃ¶ppl's sons, Otto FÃ¶ppl, came to GÃ¶ttingen taking up a position as Prandtl's assistant. In April\n1909\n, Prandtl proposed marriage to Gertrud in a letter. On\n11\nSeptember\n1909\n, Prandtl married Gertrud FÃ¶ppl in Munich. They had two daughters, Hildegard born\n1914\n, and Johanna born in\n1917\n. Johanna is the author of\n[\n4\n]\n. Before the birth of their first child they had moved into a larger apartment which was, at that time, on the edge of the town.\nWorld War I saw Prandtl involved in a large aerodynamics laboratory which was created to support the German army and navy. Several of Prandtl's assistants who had been drafted for military duties were brought back to GÃ¶ttingen to assist in this which was considered of major importance for the war effort. In\n1915\n, another wind tunnel project was started and completed in\n1917\n. This more powerful,\n300\nhorse-power, tunnel gave Prandtl more scope for research. Although financed from war funds and intended for military research, nevertheless these facilities also gave Prandtl and his team scope to undertake research with no obvious military aims which they happily undertook.\nAugust FÃ¶ppl resigned from his position at the Technical University in Munich in\n1920\nand, although he wanted to continue to be able to undertake research in the laboratory, he gave up all teaching duties. The professorship was offered to Prandtl but, after much thought, he rejected the offer. After making the position more attractive to Prandtl, it was again offered in\n1922\nand this time he accepted. However, GÃ¶ttingen were not going to give up easily and they countered with a promise of establishing a new Institute of Hydrodynamics at GÃ¶ttingen if he stayed. This was really hard decision for the Prandtl family and negotiations dragged on for about a year. Eventually in June\n1923\nhe made a decision to stay in GÃ¶ttingen. However, over the following months the promise of the Institute became uncertain causing him again to favour Munich and only in December was his decision definite when the decision to built the new Institute at GÃ¶ttingen was finalised. We note that the\nGesellschaft fÃ¼r Angewandte Mathematik und Mechanik\nwas founded in\n1922\nand Prandtl became the Society's first president. He continued in this role until\n1945\n.\nLet us now look at Prandtl's research. Busemann writes\n[\n8\n]\n:-\n... he was not even a passenger in an airplane until about\n1930\n, and his aerodynamical laboratory flourished without any connexion to an airfield. Prandtl preferred a small staff of rational thinkers and was almost afraid of the emotional interference which comes with the touch of the stick and with real flying. In no way does that mean that all play and fun were taboo at work. On the contrary, Prandtl's own way to tackle the\nNavier\n-\nStokes\nequations was to toy with flows far beyond the range of practical application, showing the pleasure and also the marvelling observation of a child, till a phenomenon crystallized that asked for explanation. Spheres and cylinders were used as models - there would be no '\nKarman\nvortex street' without that-sharp-edged corners were preferred to complicated shapes. He liked to reduce the number of arbitrary shape parameters, etc., so the brain would have no excuse for misinterpretation. The growth in time of starting vortices or of the curling ends of discontinuity layers, or the steady supersonic flow around the corner, are famous examples without any geometrical length, as indeed is the development of the boundary layer from the edge of a flat plate.\nWe have made a complete list of Prandtl's publications at\nTHIS LINK\nand this gives a good guide to the range of his work. In\n1930\n, Prandtl received the Daniel Guggenheim Medal\n[\n11\n]\n:-\nYears ago Dr Ludwig Prandtl, professor at the University of GÃ¶ttingen, Germany, studied how air rushes around moving planes. His work was so far ahead of his time and so accurate that it forms the basis of much present aerodynamic theory. Now Dr Prandtl is awarded the second Guggenheim gold medal for notable achievement in aeronautics. Orville Wright, who with his brother made the first successful flight, was presented the first medal last month.\nWhen the Nazis came to power in\n1933\nthen, on the one hand they were keen on aeronautical research, but of course there were attacks on mathematicians and theoretical physicists. It was not only those who were Jewish who were attacked. For example, although he was in no way Jewish,\nHeisenberg\nwas subjected to frequent attacks in the press describing him to be of \"Jewish style\" and his appointments were blocked. Prandtl stood up for\nHeisenberg\nand others including\nEinstein\n.\nIn September\n1938\nPrandtl attended the Fifth International Congress for Applied Mechanics in Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA. There he met with\nG I Taylor\nand\nvon KÃ¡rmÃ¡n\namong others and had useful discussions. Although these discussions were very pleasant, in general there was a difficult atmosphere at the meeting between the German scientists and others. After the meeting,\nG I Taylor\nwrote to Prandtl\n(\nsee for example\n[\n4\n]\n)\n:-\nNow I must ask you to believe that, whatever happens between our countries, the friendship and admiration which I, in common with aerodynamical people in all other countries, feel for you, will remain unchanged. I realized that you know nothing of what the criminal lunatic, who rules your country, has been doing, and so you will not be able to understand the hatred of Germany which has been growing for some years in every nation, which has a free press.\nThe Nazis investigated Prandtl since he did not believe in the Nazi \"German physics\" and \"German mathematics\" and had spoken out against such political attempts to control science for their own ideology. Their report stated\n(\nsee\n[\n1\n]\n)\n:-\nProfessor Prandtl is a typical scientist in an ivory tower. He is only interested in his scientific research which has made him world famous. Politically, he poses no threat whatsoever  ... Prandtl may be considered one of those honourable, conscientious scholars of a bygone era, conscious of his integrity and respectability, whom we certainly cannot afford to do without, nor should we wish to, in light of his immensely valuable contributions to the development of the air force.\nWhen the war ended, teaching at GÃ¶ttingen started again. Although he was now\n70\nyears old, Prandtl again began lecturing to students. Of course Germany was now occupied by the allies and another difficult period followed. Although he had taken little interest in politics all his life, now he did become interested and joined the Liberal Party. In November\n1950\nhe suffered a stroke and lost the power of one arm and a leg. However, he recovered so that he could again walk, but with a slight limp. In May\n1952\nhe spent three weeks at the health resort at Bad Gastein but felt it did him more harm than good. In August he suffered another stroke and after a period with some improvement, his health began to deteriorate quite steadily.\nPrandtl received many honours for his contributions. He was elected to the\nRoyal Society of London\nin\n1928\n, having been awarded their Gold Medal the previous year, and received a honorary degree from the University of Cambridge in\n1936\n. Many other universities gave him an honorary degree including the Technische Hochschule Danzig, the Technische Hochschule ZÃ¼rich, the Technische Hochschule Prague, the Technische Hochschule Trondheim, the University of Bucharest, and the University of Istanbul. He was given honorary membership of the Royal Aeronautical Society and awarded its gold medal. In total over twenty academies elected him to membership. He received a large numbers of medals and other awards."
