  "biografia": "Johann Friedrich Pfaff\n's father, Burkhard Pfaff, was chief financial counsellor of WÃ¼rttemberg while his mother was the daughter of a member of the exchequer of WÃ¼rttemberg. It was a family with a tradition of working as civil servants for the government of WÃ¼rttemberg.\nJohann Friedrich was the second of his parents seven sons and, although perhaps the one to attain the greatest fame, he was certainly not the only one to excel in science. The youngest of the family, Johann Wilhelm Pfaff who was born in\n1774\n, also became a mathematician and held chairs in WÃ¼rtzburg and Erlangen. The second youngest, Christoph Heinrich Pfaff was born in\n1773\nand, with interests in chemistry, medicine and pharmacy, he worked with Volta on electricity in animals.\nThere was a school in Stuttgart, the Hohe Karlsschule, which was run to train sons of government officials of WÃ¼rttemberg and Johann Friedrich attended this school from the age of nine. It was a rather uninspiring school, strong on discipline but less good academically. Pfaff did not learn much in the way of mathematics there despite attending the school until he was nearly twenty. When he left in the autumn of\n1785\nhe had completed his studies in law, a fitting subject for a civil servant.\nDespite a lack of training in mathematics at his school, Pfaff had studied mathematics on his own and began to study the works of\nEuler\n. He was encouraged to move toward scientific topics by the Duke of WÃ¼rttemberg, and he spent two years studying at the University of GÃ¶ttingen where he was taught mathematics by\nKÃ¤stner\nand he also studied physics. From GÃ¶ttingen, Pfaff moved to Berlin in the summer of\n1787\n. There he studied astronomy under J E Bode, and Pfaff wrote his first paper which was on a problem in astronomy.\nIn the spring of\n1788\nPfaff set off on a journey to Vienna but he visited many universities on the way, in particular Halle, Jena, Helmstedt, Dresden, and Prague.\nKlÃ¼gel\nwas professor of mathematics at Helmstedt and he accepted a chair at Halle leaving the position at Helmstedt vacant. Pfaff's physics professor at GÃ¶ttingen recommended him for the chair, and Pfaff submitted a dissertation on the occasion of his election as professor of mathematics at the University of Helmstedt. It was a tradition that new professors at the university there submitted an inaugural dissertation.\nPfaff's inaugural dissertation was titled\nProgramma inaugurale in quo peculiarem differentialia investigandi rationem ex theoria functionum deducit\nâ\n(\nInaugural programme in which special differential investigation leads to the theory of functions\n)\n. It investigates the use of some functional equations in order to calculate the differentials of logarithmic and trigonometrical functions as well as the binomial expansion and\nTaylor\nformula. This is studied in detail in\n[\n4\n]\n.\nFrom his appointment in\n1788\nuntil\n1810\nPfaff held the chair at Helmstedt. His appointment was approved by the Duke of WÃ¼rttemberg but it was not the best of positions, since it was poorly paid. He did good work building the strength of mathematics there and he put much effort into teaching and was successful in increasing the number of students of mathematics. One student who studied at Helmstedt was\nGauss\n. After studying at GÃ¶ttingen,\nGauss\ncame to Helmstedt in\n1798\n. He attended Pfaff's lectures and even lived in his house.\nWussing\nwrites in\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nPfaff recommended\nGauss\n's doctoral dissertation and, when necessary, greatly assisted him;\nGauss\nalways retained a friendly memory of Pfaff both as a teacher and as a man.\nBy the time\nGauss\nstudied with Pfaff at Helmstedt, the university was under threat of closure. Pfaff fought hard to prevent this and for a few years he was successful. Pfaff married in\n1803\nto Caroline Brand but sadly their first child died as an infant. By\n1810\nPfaff's attempts to preserve the University of Helmstedt finally failed with the closure of the university. The staff were given a number of different choices as to which university they might move to, and Pfaff chose to move to Halle.\nHe was appointed to the chair of mathematics at Halle in\n1810\nand in\n1812\n, on the death of\nKlÃ¼gel\n, he took on the directorship of the University Observatory too.\nPfaff did important work in analysis working on\npartial differential equations\n,\nspecial functions\nand the theory of series. He developed\nTaylor\n's Theorem using the form with remainder as given by\nLagrange\n. In\n1810\nhe contributed to the solution of a problem due to\nGauss\nconcerning the ellipse of greatest area which could be drawn inside a given quadrilateral.\nHis most important work on Pfaffian forms was published in\n1815\nwhen Pfaff was nearly fifty years old but its importance was not recognised until\n1827\nwhen\nJacobi\npublished a paper on Pfaff's method. This failure to recognise the importance of the work is strange, particularly given the very positive review which\nGauss\nwrote of the work shortly after it was published. In the\n1815\npaper, which Pfaff submitted to the\nBerlin Academy\non\n11\nMay, he presented a transformation of a first-order partial differential equation into a differential system. This theory of equations in total differentials is undoubtedly Pfaff's most significant contribution.\nWussing\nwrites in\n[\n1\n]\nthat this work by Pfaff:-\n... constituted the starting point of a basic theory of integration of partial differential equations which, through the work of\nJacobi\n,\nLie\n, and others, has developed into a modern Cartan calculus of extreme differential forms.\nAmong his other important works are\nDisquisitiones analyticae maxime ad calculum integralem et doctrinam serierum pertinentes\nâ\n(\nConcerning the integral calculus and relevant series\n)\n(1797)\n, an introductory work written in the style of\nEuler\n, and\nObservationes ad Euleri institutiones calculi integralis\nâ\n(\nObservations of  Euler on the integral calculus\n)\n."
