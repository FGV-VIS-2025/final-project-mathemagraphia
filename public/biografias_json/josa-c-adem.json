  "biografia": "JosÃ© Adem\nwas the son of Jorge Adem Jerasle\n(1890\n-\n1974)\nand Almas ChahÃ­n Yehel\n(1903\n-\n1986)\n. Jorge Adem was born in Lebanon and his wife Almas was born in Beirut, Lebanon; both had emigrated from Lebanon to Mexico. Jorge was Arabic speaking while his wife Almas spoke both Arabic and French. Jorge Adem was a merchant and, let us note, had a hobby as an angler winning a major angling championship in\n1958\n. The\n1930\nCensus lists the Adem family living at\n36\nCalle de Humbolt, Tuxpan, Veracruz. The city of Tuxpan\n(\nmeaning place of the rabbits in the Aztecs language\n)\nlies on the Pantepec River and is a major port for Mexico City. The\n1930\nCensus gives the children of Jorge and Almas Adem as: JosÃ© Adem\n(\naged\n8)\n,\nJuliÃ¡n Adem\n(\naged\n6)\n, Antonio Adem\n(\naged\n4)\nand MarÃ­a Elena Adem\n(\naged\n1)\n. In fact\nJuliÃ¡n Jorge Adem\nwas born on\n8\nJanuary\n1924\nand Antonio Jorge Adem was born on\n17\nFebruary\n1926\n. After the\n1930\nCensus, three more girls were born, Labibe Adem\n(\nborn about\n1931)\n, Alicia Adem\n(\nborn\n13\nNovember\n1933)\nand Esbaide Adem\n(\nborn\n1938)\n; all the seven children were born in Tuxpan, Veracruz.\nJuliÃ¡n Adem\nbecame an applied mathematician and geophysicist and has a biography in this archive. Antonio Adem became a businessman. Esbaide Adem became a promoter and pioneer in nuclear physics research in Mexico.\nSamuel Gitler\nwrites\n[\n7\n]\n:-\nJosÃ© Adem grew up in a family where harmony, love and tranquillity always reigned. Since he was a child he started fishing with a great interest that only increased with the years.\nJosÃ© Adem attended a primary, secondary and high school in Tuxpan. The secondary and high school had been founded by Professor Manuel C Tello in\n1938\n. From an early age he loved mathematics and showed considerable skill in the subject. A career as a mathematician was not one to really contemplate for a young man in Mexico at this time and in\n1941\nAdem went to Mexico City where he enrolled to study engineering at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. His choice of engineering was made because that course involved a considerable amount of mathematics. Although following the engineering course, Adem took as many pure mathematics courses as he could.\nWorld War II was beneficial to Adem in perhaps a surprising way.\nSolomon Lefschetz\nhad a great love for travel and during the\n1920\ns and\n1930\ns made many trips to European countries. The outbreak of World War II in\n1939\nmeant that Europe was no longer possible for travel so\nLefschetz\nlooked for other places to visit. Mexico seemed like a good choice and in\n1944\nhe spent the summer in Mexico City at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. It was the first of many visits and he eventually fell into the habit of spending the summer months there every year. His contribution to mathematics in Mexico was, as a result of these visits, of major importance and he helped build a flourishing school there. His contributions were recognised when he was awarded the Order of the Aztec Eagle in\n1964\n. In\n1970\nLefschetz\nwrote\n[\n14\n]\n:-\nIn\n1944\nI joined as a part-time connection the Instituto de Mathematicas at the National University of Mexico. This continued until\n1966\n. At the Instituto I was as free as under my Princeton professorship. I conducted seminars in topology and differential equations, gave a couple of times a \"volunteer\" course on \"general mathematical concepts\" directed at beginners and, thanks to a good working library, was able to continue research. Conditions were of course quite different from ours, but as I became rapidly fluent in Spanish, it gave me many advantages. Through the years I found quite a number of capable young men, several of whom I directed to Princeton for further advanced training up to the doctorate and later. Among them I may mention Dr JosÃ© Adem, Chairman of the Department of Mathematics of the newly founded Centro de Estudios Avanzados in Mexico City. My long connection with Mexico has been the occasion of many side trips\n(\nespecially in connection with meetings of the\nMexican Mathematical Society\n)\n, so that I have a fair acquaintance with that wonderful country.\nLefschetz\nquickly saw that Adem had considerable mathematical talents and suggested that he go to Princeton University to undertake research for a doctorate. He helped Adem get financial support for the trip. Adem completed his B.S. degree in\n1945\nand then undertook graduate work at the Mathematics Institute from\n1946\nto\n1948\n. He explained in the speech\n[\n10\n]\n, made in\n1960\n, how he progressed from engineering to topology research at Princeton:-\nAlthough I began my professional studies at the National School of Engineers, it was in the professorships of maestro\nAlfonso NÃ¡poles GÃ¡ndara\nwhere I discovered my true vocation. In this way, when I finished my studies at the Faculty of Sciences in\n1945\n, I attended the graduate courses and seminars offered at that time as they had been for several years. I remember the great influence that\nRoberto VÃ¡zquez\n's courses, the Topology seminar organised by\nVÃ¡zquez\nand\nRecillas\n, Enrique Valle's modern Algebra seminar, and Francisco Zubieta's Mathematical Logic seminar had on my formation.\nDuring the visit that\nLefschetz\nmade to the Institute in the summer of\n1949\n, I told him of my desire to go abroad for my doctorate. Days after his return to the United States, I received an offer from Princeton University, which I immediately accepted. In September of that same year, upon my arrival at Princeton, I began my research in algebraic topology under the direction of\nN E Steenrod\n. The preparation that I received in Mexico was satisfactory.\nAs well as attending pure mathematics courses, he also undertook work on applied mathematics between\n1946\nand\n1948\nand he published the paper\nAn elementary solution of a problem of anisotropic elasticity\n(1949)\n. Albert W SÃ¡enz writes in the review\n[\n15\n]\n:-\nThe author treats the problem of a semi-infinite anisotropic plate whose axes of symmetry coincide with the Cartesian axes, and which is subjected to a normal concentrated force at the origin. The solution is obtained by elementary methodsÂ ...\nIn\n1949\nAdem set out for Princeton to begin his Ph.D. studies. He crossed the border between Mexico and the United States at San Antonio, Texas, on\n21\nSeptember\n1949\n. On the Border Crossing form Adem is described as\n6\nft\n1\n2\n\\large\\frac{1}{2}\\normalsize\n2\n1\nâ\nin tall with a dark complexion, black hair and brown eyes. He was initially allowed to stay until\n25\nJune\n1950\nas a student. Alejandro Adem Diaz de Leon writes\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nBy the year\n1950\n, the development of mathematics had extended beyond the classical formal areas and was growing rapidly in the interactions between geometry, algebra and analysis. In particular, algebraic methods were introduced to study topological situations. This principle, developed under the tutelage of\nLefschetz\n, among others, represented an exceptional advance for mathematics. Among the most successful exponents of this new philosophy was\nNorman Steenrod\n, under whose direction Adem was fortunate to complete his doctoral thesis.\nHe was awarded a John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Fellowship in\n1951\nto continue his research. He did outstanding research for his thesis and, before submitting his thesis, wrote up a short paper containing the main results promising to provide full proofs in a later work. The paper giving the results was\nThe iteration of the Steenrod squares in algebraic topology\n(1952)\npublished by the\nUnited States National Academy of Sciences\n. This work introduces the concept now known as \"Adem relations\". Today\n[\nJanuary\n2023]\nMathSciNet\nlists over\n200\npapers with \"Adem relations\" mentioned in either the title or the review. The\n1952\npaper begins\n[\n3\n]\n:-\nIn this work it is proved that the\nSteenrod\nsquares on cohomology classes satisfy certain identities. These identities are applied to solve particular homotopy problems. Full details will appear elsewhere.\nThe Guggenheim Fellowship we have just mentioned was only one of several sources of support that Adem was receiving and in this paper he gives the following acknowledgement\n[\n3\n]\n:-\nThe research summarised in the present note has been supported at various times by the following institutions: Instituto de Matematicas de la Universidad Nacional and Instituto Nacional de la Investigacion Cientifica, Mexico City, the Higgins Foundation, Princeton University and the Rockefeller and Guggenheim Foundations.\nIn\n1952\nAdem was awarded a Ph.D. by Princeton University for his\n80\n-page thesis\nIterations of the squaring operations in algebraic topology\n; his thesis advisor had been\nNorman Steenrod\n. In\n1953\nAdem published another summary of results from his thesis in the paper\nRelations on iterated reduced powers\nwhich again was published by the\nUnited States National Academy of Sciences\n. This paper begins\n[\n4\n]\n:-\nIn this note we present the generalisation of the relations on iterated squares to the case of iterated cyclic reduced powers of arbitrary prime period p. As in the case p =\n2\n, the new relations are used to solve some particular problems.\nHe notes in the paper\n[\n4\n]\n:-\nI have heard that\nH Cartan\nhas obtained relations of the same type, using methods quite different from mine.\nWe will give a quote below from\nHenri Cartan\nconcerning this.\nSamuel Gitler\nwrites of Adem's time at Princeton\n[\n7\n]\n:-\nHe had a great sense of humour, a noble soul that, together with his privileged intelligence and his enormous desire for knowledge, made him soon establish friendship with a large number of mathematicians from various countries of the world with whom he maintained correspondence throughout his life.\nAdem remained at Princeton until\n1954\nwhen he returned to Mexico City on an Air France plane leaving New York on\n21\nJune. After arriving, he was appointed as a researcher at the Mathematics Institute of the National Autonomous University of Mexico. In July\n1954\nhe attended the 'Second symposium on some mathematical problems that are being studied in Latin America' which was held at the UNESCO Centre for Scientific Cooperation for Latin America in Montevideo, Uruguay. He published an expository paper in the\nProceedings\ndiscussing results he had already published.\nSolomon Lefschetz\n's\n70\nth birthday was on\n3\nSeptember\n1954\nand the volume\nGeometry and topology A symposium in honor of S Lefschetz\n(1957)\nwas published. This volume contains a\n48\n-page paper\nThe relations on Steenrod powers of cohomology classes\nby Adem.\nHenri Cartan\nwrites in the review\n[\n5\n]\n:-\nThe author gives detailed proofs of the relations between iterated\nSteenrod\noperations which he had previously announced in\n[\n'The iteration of the Steenrod squares in algebraic topology'\n(1952)\n, 'Relations on iterated reduced powers'\n(1953)]\n. In the meantime, the proof by\nH Cartan\nappeared\n[(1955)]\nwhich uses a completely different method. Adem adopts the point of view of\nSteenrod\n...\n...\nThe calculations\n[\nby Adem\n]\nare delicate, and carried out with great care; in general, the exposition of this difficult subject is made with great clarity and precision. ... Topological applications of the theory are promised for future work.\nIn\n1956\nAdem took over as editor of the\nBulletin\nof the\nMexican Mathematical Society\n. He published many of his papers in that journal\n[\n7\n]\n:-\nWith his great mathematical prestige and his hard editorial work, he managed to make it a journal of recognised international prestige, where many articles by mathematicians from various countries around the world have been published, including of course Mexican mathematicians. He kept it at that level until his death.\nAdem was one of eight organisers of the 'International Symposium on Algebraic Topology' held in Mexico City at the National Autonomous University of Mexico in August\n1956\nin memory of\nWitold Hurewicz\n. At the Symposium, Adem lectured and published a\n37\n-page paper in the conference\nProceedings\n. Guy Hirsch writes in a review of the paper\n[\n8\n]\n:-\nThe paper describes secondary cohomology operations associated with the relations between iterated\nSteenrod\nsquares which the author proved in an earlier paper\n[\n'Algebraic geometry and topology, A symposium in honor of S Lefschetz,\n1957\n'\n]\n; essentially the same method is used here, of which an outline is given\n(\nwith less details than in the former paper\n)\nin the first part of this paper.\nFrom his Immigration records, we know that Adem lived at Eugenia\n408\n, Mexico City. This is just outside the city centre in the south west part of the city. This is on the right side for the University which is on the south west edge of the city. His travel records show many trips to the United States in addition to his time as a postgraduate student at Princeton. For example: he flew from Mexico City to New York arriving\n22\nNovember\n1955\n; he flew from Mexico City to San Antonio, Texas arriving\n22\nApril\n1957\n; he flew from Mexico City to Chicago arriving\n15\nJuly\n1958\non his way to stay at Fine Hall, Princeton, and he flew from Mexico City to New York arriving\n24\nApril\n1961\non his way to stay at Fine Hall, Princeton.\nOn\n14\nJune\n1960\nhe became a member of El Colegio Nacional which is a public institution dedicated to the dissemination of scientific, artistic and humanistic culture. Today it has\n37\nmembers. Its headquarters are atÂ Donceles\n104\n, in the Historic Centre of Mexico City. The citation for his award reads\n[\n10\n]\n:-\nHe discovered universal formulas, the \"Adem Relations\", in which the algebraic nature associated with each geometric object is established. In the field of algebraic topology he worked on the iteration of\nSteenrod\n's squares in their relation and application to geometry. He is the author of 'Algebraic Geometry and Topology'\n(1957)\n, 'Lecture Notes in Mathematics'\n(1970)\n, among other works. He co-founded the Department of Mathematics at Cinvestav. He was awarded the National Prize for Sciences and Arts\n1967\n. He entered El Colegio Nacional on\n14\nJune\n1960\n.\nHis admittance speech to El Colegio Nacional begins as follows\n[\n10\n]\n:-\nI arrive today with a deep emotion to this welcoming House. My election as a Member of the National College has been the most pleasant and profound of surprises. Surprise not only for me, but also for my mathematical colleagues, with whom I have been so actively and fruitfully linked in recent years. The nature of our work apparently closes to us some doors more accessible to other specialists, but this does not mean that there is not a decided interest among us in everything related to culture in general and to the development of our country. The great honour that is now being given to me, I take as both an award and an incentive to a team of scientific workers of which I am a part.\nFor an English translation of his full admittance speech on the history of the mathematical movement in Mexico, see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nSamuel Gitler\nwas a Mexican mathematician who, like Adem, went to Princeton to study for a Ph.D. which he was awarded in\n1960\n. He writes\n[\n7\n]\n:-\nI remember that before I returned to Mexico,\nNorman Steenrod\n, also my thesis advisor, told me that I was very lucky to go to work with JosÃ© Adem, because I would learn from him how to do mathematics and how to write it. A fundamental part of mathematical research is how to write the results already obtained, because when you do, you find generalisations and many, many times, better results. Each article JosÃ© Adem wrote went through many drafts, always searching for the best expression. I had the opportunity to collaborate in several of them and I learned a lot from this experience. His articles are a model of how to write mathematics; express the results in a precise way and in the demonstrations look for clarity and elegance.\nAdem helped in the formation of the Centre for Research and Advanced Studies of the National Polytechnic Institute, assisting the director Arturo Rosenblueth. In\n1961\nAdem became the director of the mathematics department of the Centre for Research and Advanced Studies of the National Polytechnic Institute, a position he held until\n1973\n. He taught at both the National Autonomous University of Mexico and the Higher School of Physics and Mathematics of the National Polytechnic Institute. On a number of occasions he was offered the position of director of the Centre for Research and Advanced Studies which he turned down. He was also offered national roles like Undersecretary of Public Education which he also turned down. He refused such roles in the belief that were he to accept he would become a mediocre researcher and a poor administrator. His passion was mathematical research and he felt that it was in this area that he could make the greatest contribution to his country.\nAlthough he refused to take on major administrative roles, he participated in many ways in the mathematical life of Mexico. He was a member of the National Institute of Scientific Research from\n1961\nto\n1970\n, and when it became the National Council of Science and Technology he served as an advisor from\n1971\nto\n1976\n. The Universidad AutÃ³noma Metropolitana was founded in Mexico City in\n1974\nand Adem served on its Board of Directors from its founding until\n1982\n. He was also a member of the Board of Directors of the National System of Researchers from\n1984\nto\n1988\nand a member of the Advisory Council of Sciences of the Presidency of the Republic from\n1988\n. He was a member of the International Committee of the Latin American School of Mathematics from\n1968\n.\nIn\n1981\nAdem was\n60\nyears old and a conference was organised to celebrate the occasion. The conference proceedings\n[\n6\n]\ncontains papers by both leading Mexican and leading international topologists. Authors include\nSamuel Gitler\n, Vic Snaith,\nFrank Adams\nand\nEdwin Spanier\n.\nAdem died on\n14\nFebruary\n1991\nat the age of\n69\n. He continued to write papers to the end of his life, his last\nGeneralized Hurwitz maps of the type\nS\nÃ\nV\nâ\nW\nS  \\times  V \\rightarrow  W\nS\nÃ\nV\nâ\nW\ncompleted only days before his death. Also shortly before his death he attended the Ph.D. viva of one of his students.\nLet us end with quoting from\nSamuel Gitler\nwho knew Adem very well\n[\n7\n]\n:-\nHe was an excellent teacher in the classroom. He had a special talent for explaining very complicated topics in a very understandable way, always with relevant examples that made understanding a concept much easier.\n...\nJosÃ© Adem had a photographic memory and great intelligence. He was a man of science who tried to understand the results in other areas of knowledge. His engineering training enabled him to understand many problems in physics. He had great pleasure in painting and literature. Conversing with him on any subject was always one of my most happy pleasures. I always came out richer.\n...\nJosÃ© Adem leaves us a scientific tradition and goals to achieve; do top-notch research in Mexico and publish it. Only by having first class science can we aspire to raise the levels of education to a higher level and thus be able to face the challenge that is presented to us to improve our quality as human beings and as Mexicans."
