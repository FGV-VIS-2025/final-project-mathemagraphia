  "biografia": "EugÃ¨ne RouchÃ©\nwas born in SommiÃ¨res in southern France. This town, about\n30\nkm from the south coast, is situated between Nimes and Montpellier and now contains a street named after the famous mathematician. His parents were Jean Jacques RouchÃ©\n(1818\n-\n1861)\nand Marie Nicot\n(1807\n-\n1861)\n. Jean Jacques RouchÃ© was a tax collector and the family moved to Aniane in the HÃ©rault district where Jean Jacques was employed.\nRouchÃ© completed his schooling at the Sainte-Barbe College in Rue Valette in Paris. This school, founded in\n1460\n, was designed to prepare students for sitting the entrance examinations for the Ãcole Polytechnique and the Ãcole Normale SupÃ©rieure. He attended the school at the same time as Gustave Eiffel\n(1832\n-\n1923)\n, later famed as an engineer. In\n1852\n, after success in the entrance examinations to the Grandes Ãcoles, RouchÃ© entered the Ãcole Polytechnique. When he entered this university, his home address was in Aniane and his physical description is recorded as: light brown hair; low forehead; medium nose; red eyes; medium mouth; round chin; and rounded face. He was in the same class as Alfred de Billy\n(1832\n-\n1906)\nwho became an Inspector of Finances, Fernand Raoul-Duval\n(1833\n-\n1892)\nwho became a leading engineer, and FranÃ§ois ChrÃ©tien LÃ©on Hartung\n(1832\n-\n1908)\nwho, after a military career, became governor of Verdun. RouchÃ© graduated from the Ãcole Polytechnique in\n1854\nafter two years of study.\nAfter training as a mathematician, RouchÃ© taught for one year at Nantes where he was appointed professor of physics at the LycÃ©e de Nantes. Then, in\n1855\n, he was appointed as professor of mathematics at the LycÃ©e Charlemagne in Paris. At this stage RouchÃ© had spent only two undergraduate years for his university of mathematics and physics and he had no research degree. He now undertook research and, on\n17\nJuly\n1858\n, he presented two theses to the Faculty of Science in Paris for the degree of Doctor of Mathematical Sciences. The first of these theses was on analysis and was entitled\nSur le dÃ©veloppement des fonctions en sÃ©ries ordonnÃ©es suivant les dÃ©nominateurs des rÃ©duites d'une fraction continue\nâ\n(\nOn the development of the functions in series ordered according to the denominators of the reductions of a continuous fraction\n)\nwhile the second was on mechanics and was entitled\nSur les intÃ©grales communes Ã  plusieurs problÃ¨mes de mÃ©canique relatifs au mouvement d'un point sur une surface\nâ\n(\nOn the integrals common to several problems of mechanics relating to the movement of a point on a surface.\n)\n. This second thesis was on a topic which had been studied by\nJoseph Bertrand\n. RouchÃ© dedicated his two doctoral theses to Auguste Nouseilles\n(1798\n-\n1881)\n, Principal of the LycÃ©e Charlemagne. An oral examination was held on\n8\nNovember\n1858\nwith\nLouis LefÃ©bure de Fourcy\nas President, and\nGabriel LamÃ©\nand\nJoseph Liouville\nas examiners. RouchÃ© was awarded his doctorate but we have to feel a little sorry for him since\nLefÃ©bure de Fourcy\nhad a reputation as a difficult examiner. An inspector who sat in on several of the examinations conducted by\nLefÃ©bure de Fourcy\nwrote:-\nSeveral times I attended oral examinations by Mr\nLefÃ©bure de Fourcy\nand this is my impression. The professor cannot be considered a benevolent reviewer, his voice is harsh, his tone is dismissive, also he questioned in a very firm stiff manner, and showed no mercy for any errors of logic.\nIn\n1858\nRouchÃ© was appointed as admissions examiner for the Ãcole Centrale in Paris, a position he held until\n1877\n. He was appointed as a tutor for geometry and stereotomy for the Ãcole Polytechnique in\n1861\n, continuing to hold this position for the next\n22\nyears. RouchÃ© married Suzanne HÃ©lÃ¨ne Marie Bouzanquet on\n11\nDecember\n1861\nin Lunel, HÃ©rault. HÃ©lÃ¨ne Marie Bouzanquet had been born\n26\nSeptember\n1838\nin Lunel. They had a son Louis EugÃ¨ne RouchÃ©\n(1862\n-\n1957)\nwho was known as \"Jacques\". He became an Inspector of Finance, and Director of the National Academy of Music and Dance from\n1914\nto\n1944\n.\nIn\n1867\nRouchÃ© was nominated professor of descriptive geometry and stereotomy at the Ãcole Centrale in Paris. He also acted as an examiner at the Ãcole Polytechnique from\n1877\nto\n1883\n. In\n1884\nhe was named professor holding the chair of descriptive geometry at the Conservatoire des Arts et MÃ©tiers in Paris. He continued to hold this position until he retired in\n1905\n.\nRouchÃ© published many mathematics articles, among them were some which appeared in\nComptes Rendus\nand some in the\nJournal of the Ãcole Polytechnique\n. For example he published\nMÃ©moire sur la serie de Lagrange\nâ\n(\nMemoir on the series of Lagrange\n)\nin the second of these two journals in\n1862\n. In\nComptes Rendus\nhe published papers such as\nSur la discussion des Ã©quations du premier degrÃ©\nâ\n(\nOn the discussion of first degree equations\n)\n(1875)\n,\nSur les lignes asymptotiques d'une surface du quatriÃ¨me degrÃ©\nâ\n(\nOn the asymptotic lines of a surface of the fourth degree\n)\n(1877)\n,\nSur un problÃ¨me relatif Ã  la durÃ©e du jeu\nâ\n(\nOn a problem with the duration of the game\n)\n(1888)\n, and\nSur la formule de Stirling\nâ\n(\nOn the Stirling formula\n)\n(1890)\n. The two-page paper\nSur la discussion des equations du premier degrÃ©\nâ\n(\nOn the discussion of equations of the first degree\n)\nin volume\n81\nof\nComptes Rendus\nof the\nAcadÃ©mie des Sciences\ncontains his result on solving systems of linear equations. This is the well-known criterion which says that a system of linear equations has a solution if and only if the rank of the matrix of the associated homogeneous system is equal to the rank of the augumented matrix of the system. RouchÃ© later published a fuller version of this theorem in\n1880\nin the\nJournal de l'Ãcole Polytechnique\n. In fact he was not the first to prove such a result and, after RouchÃ©'s paper appeared, Georges FontenÃ© published a note in the\nNouvelles Annales de MathÃ©matiques\nclaiming priority. When\nGeorg Frobenius\ndiscussed this result in his papers, for example in\nZur Theorie der linearen Gleichungen\nâ\n(\nOn the theory of linear equations\n)\npublished in\nCrelle's Journal\nin\n1905\n, he gave credit for proving the theorem to both RouchÃ© and FontenÃ©. However it is now often called the RouchÃ©-\nFrobenius\ntheorem, especially in the Spanish speaking world. This is almost certainly because the Spanish/Argentinian mathematician\nJulio Rey Pastor\nreferred to the theorem by this name.\nAlthough few today know who RouchÃ© was, his name is very well known through 'RouchÃ©'s theorem' which he published in volume\n39\nof the\nJournal\nof the Ãcole Polytechnique in\n1862\n:-\nIf f\n(\nz\n)\nand g\n(\nz\n)\nare two complex functions which are regular within and on a closed contour C, on which f\n(\nz\n)\ndoes not vanish and also\nâ£\ng\n(\nz\n)\nâ£\n<\nâ£\nf\n(\nz\n)\nâ£\n|g(z)| < |f (z)|\nâ£\ng\n(\nz\n)\nâ£\n<\nâ£\nf\n(\nz\n)\nâ£\nthen\nf\n(\nz\n)\nf (z)\nf\n(\nz\n)\nand\nf\n(\nz\n)\n+\ng\n(\nz\n)\nf (z) + g(z)\nf\n(\nz\n)\n+\ng\n(\nz\n)\nhave the same number of zeros within C.\nRouchÃ© also wrote several textbooks including\nElÃ©ments d'algÃ¨bre Ã  l'usage des candidats au baccalaurÃ©at Ã©s sciences et aux Ã©coles spÃ©ciales\nâ\n(\nElements of algebra for candidates for the baccalaureate of science and special schools\n)\n(1857)\n,\nLeÃ§ons nouvelles de trigonomÃ©trie rectiligne et sphÃ©rique\nâ\n(\nNew lessons in rectilinear and spherical trigonometry\n)\n(\nwritten jointly with L Lacour\n)\n(1857)\n,\nTraitÃ© de gÃ©omÃ©trie Ã©lÃ©mentaire\nâ\n(\nTreatise on elementary geometry\n)\n(\nwritten jointly with Charles de Comberousse\n)\n(1864\n-\n1866)\n,\nÃlÃ©ments de Statique Graphique\nâ\n(\nElements of graphic statics\n)\n(1889)\n,\nCoupe des pierres: prÃ©cÃ©dÃ©e des principes du trait de stÃ©rÃ©otomie\nâ\n(\nCutting stones: preceded by the principles of the theory of stereotomy\n)\n(\nwritten jointly with Charles Brisse\n)\n(1893)\n, and\nAnalyse infinitÃ©simale Ã  l'usage des ingÃ©nieurs\nâ\n(\nInfinitesimal analysis for engineers\n)\n(2\nvolumes\n)\n(1900\n-\n1902)\n. This two volume work was the result of a collaboration with Lucien LÃ©vy\n(1853\n-\n1912)\nwho was the father of the well known mathematician\nPaul LÃ©vy\n. Lucien LÃ©vy taught mathematics at the LycÃ©e Louis-le-Grand in Paris and, for\n23\nyears, was an examiner at the Ãcole Polytechnique.\nHis most famous textbook was the geometry book written jointly with Charles Jules FÃ©lix de Comberousse\n(1826\n-\n1897)\nwho taught mathematics at the CollÃ¨ge Chaptal in Paris. This book appeared in two volumes, the first being on\nGÃ©omÃ©trie plane\nâ\n(\nPlane geometry\n)\nand the second on\nGÃ©omÃ©trie dans l'espace\nâ\n(\nGeometry in space\n)\n. The book went through many editions, for example the seventh edition of this work was published in Paris by Gauthier-Villars in\n1900\n. It was a major treatise, the volumes having\n548\nand\n664\npages respectively. Editions continued to be published after RouchÃ©'s death, with a new edition published in Paris by Gauthier-Villars in\n1922\nand another in\n1954\n. Indeed it is still in print now with a reproduction produced in\n2010\n. The authors describe their approach to writing this textbook in the following way:-\nThere are two ways of writing a book intended for study: one can restrict oneself to the official syllabus and do not go outside the framework; or perhaps one can also, by strictly following these syllabuses in what they require to be compulsory, yet go beyond and try to complete them. In order to apply a science, it is not sufficient to know a few parts of it, rather it is necessary to be familiar with all its methods, to grasp the whole. The magnificent discoveries of modern geometry have not penetrated into teaching; abandoned by the official syllabuses, they do not occupy the place in the series of mathematical studies due to them; we speak of it only a little and incidentally in Analytical Geometry, where it seems to be wrong to replace the admirable ideas created by\nDescartes\nby new ideas. We are far from reproaching the syllabuses for their silence in this respect; they are so full that it would be unworthy to demand an addition. But can one not learn the syllabus required for an examination and try at the same time to understand the scope of the science that is being studied, by making with a quick study, an overview of its main methods? Such is the thought which guided us in the composition of this work.\nFor a list of the contents of the\n1900\nedition of this work, which clearly exhibits the philosophy described by its authors in the above quote, see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nEdmond Laguerre\ndied in\n1886\nand RouchÃ© became one of the editors to work on the production of his\nCollected Works\n. There were three editors for this work, the other two being\nCharles Hermite\nand\nHenri PoincarÃ©\n.\nOeuvres de Laguerre Tome I, AlgÃ¨bre, calcul integral\nâ\n(\nWorks of Laguerre Vol I, Algebra, calculus integral\n)\nappeared in\n1898\nand\nOeuvres de Laguerre Tome II, GÃ©omÃ©trie\nâ\n(\nWorks of Laguerre Vol II, Geometry\n)\nwas published in\n1905\n.\nRouchÃ© was a member of the\nSociÃ©tÃ© MathÃ©matique de France\n, serving as its president in\n1883\n-\n84\n. He was also a member of the\nSociÃ©tÃ© philomathique\nin Paris and a member of the\nConseil supÃ©rieur de l'enseignement technique\n. He was elected to the\nAcademy of Sciences\nin\n1896\nand to the AcadÃ©mie des Sciences et Lettres de Montpellier.\nThe town of Lunel where RouchÃ© died is close to his birthplace of SommiÃ¨res. In fact it is situated about halfway between SommiÃ¨res and the southern coast of France."
