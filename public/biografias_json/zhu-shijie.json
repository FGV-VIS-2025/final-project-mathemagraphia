  "biografia": "Zhu Shijie\nis also known as\nChu Shih-Chieh\n. Little is known about his life other than that he wrote two outstanding mathematical texts. He must have been born around the time that\nQin Jiushao\ndied, which was about the same time that\nYang Hui\n's first texts were appearing, and he probably was not very old when\nLi Zhi\ndied. Zhu was, therefore, the last of these four great thirteenth century Chinese mathematicians but it would appear from his writings that he was unaware of the work of his three famous predecessors. The birth dates and death dates we give are based solely on the dates on which Zhu's two texts appeared. However these tell us that he must have been brought up while the Nan\n(\nSouthern\n)\nSung dynasty was being defeated by the Mongols.\nKublai Khan united the whole of China in\n1279\nand the Yuan dynasty came to power. The capital of the new united China became Dadu\n(\ntoday called Beijing or Peking\n)\nwhich Kublai Khan had built up as a walled city with splendid palaces and government offices. The unification of north and south China would have a significant effect on Zhu's life, for it allowed him to travel throughout the whole of China, and also allowed certain mathematical expertise which was previously known only in northern China to spread through the south. What little we know of Zhu is contained in the following quotation from the preface to the second, and most famous, of his texts. The preface, written by Mo Ruo, tells us that\n(\nsee\n[\n4\n]\n)\n:-\nZhu Shijie of Yan-shan became famous as a mathematician. He travelled widely for more than twenty years and the number of those who came to be taught by him increased each day.\nYan-shan was near the new capital of united China at Dadu\n(\ntoday called Beijing or Peking\n)\n. We see from this quotation that, as we mentioned above, the stability brought by the Mongol conquest gave Zhu opportunities to travel of which he took full advantage.\nWe know that Zhu wrote two books, the\nSuanxue qimeng\n(\nIntroduction to mathematical studies\n)\npublished in\n1299\n, and the\nSiyuan yujian\n(\nJade mirror of the four unknowns\n)\npublished in\n1303\n. These are remarkable works which led to George Sarton writing that Zhu was\n(\nsee\n[\n1\n]\nwhere this is quoted\n)\n:-\n... one of the greatest mathematicians of his race, of his time, and indeed of all times.\nThe\nIntroduction to Mathematical Studies\nwas intended for beginners. It appears to have been lost soon after it was first published, but it must have found its way to Japan and Korea for it was used there as a mathematical textbook. It was printed in\n1433\nin Korea and in\n1658\nin Japan but a Chinese version only became available again in the nineteen century when a\n1660\nKorean edition was translated back into Chinese.\nRuan Yuan\nadded a preface to a new version published in\n1839\nwhich also contains contributions by\nLi Shanlan\n. Zhu's book is based, as so many Chinese mathematics books were, on the\nNine Chapters on the Mathematical Art\n. The book contains examples of computations with fractions and decimals giving results such as\n1\n16\n=\n0.0625\n\\large\\frac{1}{16}\\normalsize  = 0.0625\n1\n6\n1\nâ\n=\n0\n.\n0\n6\n2\n5\nand\n2\n16\n=\n0.125\n\\large\\frac{2}{16}\\normalsize  = 0.125\n1\n6\n2\nâ\n=\n0\n.\n1\n2\n5\n. Zhu also explains the rule of three, areas and volumes, and the rule of false double position. Some of his discussions extend methods from the\nNine Chapters\n. In dealing with simultaneous equations, Zhu certainly presented improvements, giving a method essentially equivalent to\nGauss\n's pivotal condensation.\nSome of Zhu's text, however, presents ideas going far beyond\nNine Chapters\n. He treats polynomial algebra, and polynomial equations, by the \"coefficient array method\" or \"method of the celestial unknown\" which had been developed in northern China by the earlier thirteenth century Chinese mathematicians, but up till that time had not spread to southern China. There are still questions about this aspect, however, which have not been answered satisfactorily. In particular, how much was Zhu aware of\nYang Hui\n's work?\nZhu's second book\nSiyuan yujian\n(\nJade mirror of the four unknowns\n)\nmarks the peak of Chinese mathematics and it was a long time before mathematics in China progressed beyond it. Like Zhu's earlier text, this one also seems to have vanished at some point. It survived in China probably until the second half of the eighteenth century when it appears to have become lost. When\nRuan Yuan\ncompiled the\nChouren zhuan\nor\nBiographies of astronomers and mathematicians\nin\n1799\n, he failed to find Zhu's text despite his expertise in tracking down old books. However some years later\nRuan Yuan\nfound a copy of the\nSiyuan yujian\nin Zhejiang\n(\nor Chekiang\n)\nprovince when he was governor there. He made a hand written copy which was sent to\nLi Rui\nfor editing but\nLi Rui\ndied before the work could be completed. Ruan's hand written copy of the\nSiyuan yujian\nwas eventually printed.\nThe text of the\nSiyuan yujian\nwhich is available today is therefore not the one which was originally published by Zhu. The problem arises since the version which\nRuan Yuan\ndiscovered was\n[\n4\n]\n:-\n... extremely corrupted and teeming with errors.\nThe present version has seven prefaces, two are dated\n1303\nthe first being written Zhao Cheng and the second by Mo Ruo and Zu Yi. Of the other prefaces, one is written by\nRuan Yuan\nand the others by later commentators. There are various nineteenth century commentaries on the text all of which make it harder to identify Zhu's original work. Let us examine what this remarkable book contains.\nFollowing the prefaces, which we mentioned above, there are four figures. One of these is\nPascal's triangle\nwhich gives the coefficients needed to expand sums of unknowns up to the eighth power. Zhu makes no claims for originality calling it:-\n... the table of the ancient method of powers up to the eighth.\nYou can see Zhu's Pascal triangle diagram at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nThere are then four preliminary problems which Zhu uses to explain his methods of using polynomials to solve problems with\n1\n,\n2\n,\n3\n, and\n4\nunknowns. In fact Zhu uses an extension of the \"coefficient array method\" or \"method of the celestial unknown\" to polynomials with several unknowns. Zu Yi, in his preface, says that Zhu is extending to four unknowns methods for dealing with two or three unknowns:-\n... that the procedure of the celestial unknown had received previously to him.\nAfter these four examples to illustrate the methods, Zhu presents\n288\nproblems which are divided into three volumes with\n24\nchapters. One of the most interesting aspects of this work is that Zhu, although still using the traditional Chinese approach of presenting mathematics through practical problems, does not in any sense make his examples realistic. Rather they are simply vehicles to present the methods. Therefore Zhu does not necessarily give the simplest solution to a problem, but rather often introduces complications explicitly designed to illustrate how to handle more complicated situations. Let us illustrate by giving one of Zhu's problems.\nA right-angled triangle has area\n30\nsquare bu. The sum of the base and height of the triangle is\n17\nbu. What is the sum of the base and hypotenuse?\nFirst let us take a straightforward approach. Suppose the base is\nx\nx\nx\nbu, the height is\ny\ny\ny\nbu, and the hypotenuse is\nz\nz\nz\nbu. Then the given information is\n1\n2\nx\ny\n=\n30\n\\large\\frac{1}{2}\\normalsize xy = 30\n2\n1\nâ\nx\ny\n=\n3\n0\nand\nx\n+\ny\n=\n17\nx + y = 17\nx\n+\ny\n=\n1\n7\n. Eliminating\ny\ny\ny\ngives the quadratic\nx\n(\n17\nâ\nx\n)\n=\n60\nx(17 - x) = 60\nx\n(\n1\n7\nâ\nx\n)\n=\n6\n0\nor\nx\n2\nâ\n17\nx\n+\n60\n=\n0\nx^{2} - 17x + 60 = 0\nx\n2\nâ\n1\n7\nx\n+\n6\n0\n=\n0\n. Hence\nx\nx\nx\n=\n12\nor\n5\nbut the base having the shorter length gives\nx\nx\nx\n=\n5\nbu,\ny\ny\ny\n=\n12\nbu, so\nz\n=\nâ\n(\n5\n2\n+\n1\n2\n2\n)\n=\n13\nz = â(5^{2} + 12^{2}) = 13\nz\n=\nâ\n(\n5\n2\n+\n1\n2\n2\n)\n=\n1\n3\n. Hence base plus hypotenuse is\nx\n+\nz\n=\n18\nx + z = 18\nx\n+\nz\n=\n1\n8\nbu. Zhu, however, wants to illustrate something more advanced than solving a quadratic equation.\nLet\nt\n=\nz\n+\nx\nt = z + x\nt\n=\nz\n+\nx\n. Then substituting\nz\n=\nx\nâ\nt\nz = x - t\nz\n=\nx\nâ\nt\n,\ny\n=\n17\nâ\nx\ny = 17 - x\ny\n=\n1\n7\nâ\nx\ninto\nx\n2\n+\ny\n2\nâ\nz\n2\nx^{2} + y^{2} - z^{2}\nx\n2\n+\ny\n2\nâ\nz\n2\ngives\nx\n2\nâ\n34\nx\n+\n2\nt\nx\n+\n289\nâ\nt\n2\n=\n0\nx^{2} - 34x + 2tx + 289 - t^{2} = 0\nx\n2\nâ\n3\n4\nx\n+\n2\nt\nx\n+\n2\n8\n9\nâ\nt\n2\n=\n0\n.Â Â Â\n(1)\nBut\nx\n2\nâ\n17\nx\n+\n60\n=\n0\nx^{2} -17x + 60 = 0\nx\n2\nâ\n1\n7\nx\n+\n6\n0\n=\n0\n, so substituting\nx\n2\n=\n17\nx\nâ\n60\nx^{2} =17x - 60\nx\n2\n=\n1\n7\nx\nâ\n6\n0\ninto\n(1)\ngives\n0\n=\n229\nâ\n17\nx\n+\n2\nx\nt\nâ\nt\n2\n0 = 229 - 17x + 2xt - t^{2}\n0\n=\n2\n2\n9\nâ\n1\n7\nx\n+\n2\nx\nt\nâ\nt\n2\nor\nx\n=\nâ\n229\n+\nt\n2\nâ\n17\n+\n2\nt\nx = \\Large\\frac{-229 + t^{2}}{-17 + 2t}\nx\n=\nâ\n1\n7\n+\n2\nt\nâ\n2\n2\n9\n+\nt\n2\nâ\n. Substituting this last expression for\nx\nx\nx\ninto\n(1)\nand multiplying through by\n(\nâ\n17\n+\n2\nt\n)\n2\n(-17 + 2t)^{2}\n(\nâ\n1\n7\n+\n2\nt\n)\n2\ngives\nt\n4\nâ\n34\nt\n3\n+\n71\nt\n2\n+\n3706\nt\n+\n3600\n=\n0\nt^{4} - 34t^{3} + 71t^{2} + 3706t + 3600 = 0\nt\n4\nâ\n3\n4\nt\n3\n+\n7\n1\nt\n2\n+\n3\n7\n0\n6\nt\n+\n3\n6\n0\n0\n=\n0\n.Â Â Â\n(2)\nAlthough we cannot be certain that Zhu's methods are exactly what we have presented here, he certainly arrived at the equation\n(2)\n. He has illustrated how to work with the four unknowns\nx\n,\ny\n,\nz\n,\nt\nx, y, z, t\nx\n,\ny\n,\nz\n,\nt\nand he can now illustrate how to solve a quartic equation.\nNow\n(2)\nhas the roots -\n1\n, -\n8\n,\n18\n,\n25\nbut Zhu only gives the correct answer\nt\n=\nz\n+\nx\n=\n18\nt = z + x = 18\nt\n=\nz\n+\nx\n=\n1\n8\nbu.\nHere is another of Zhu's problems. It is phrased in terms of a right angled triangle, but the conditions are so artificial that he is really simply giving a system of equations. The sides of the triangle are\nx\n,\ny\n,\nz\nx, y, z\nx\n,\ny\n,\nz\nwhere\nz\nz\nz\nis the hypotenuse.\nGiven the relations\n2\ny\nz\n=\nz\n2\n+\nx\nz\n2yz = z^{2} + xz\n2\ny\nz\n=\nz\n2\n+\nx\nz\nand\n2\nx\n+\n4\ny\n+\n4\nz\n=\nx\n(\ny\n2\nâ\nz\n+\nx\n)\n2x + 4y + 4z = x(y^{2} - z + x)\n2\nx\n+\n4\ny\n+\n4\nz\n=\nx\n(\ny\n2\nâ\nz\n+\nx\n)\nbetween the sides of a right angled triangle x, y, z where z is the hypotenuse, find\nd\n=\n2\nx\n+\n2\ny\nd = 2x + 2y\nd\n=\n2\nx\n+\n2\ny\n.\n[\nAnswer:\nd\n=\n14\nd = 14\nd\n=\n1\n4\n(\nNote\nx\n=\n3\n,\ny\n=\n4\n,\nz\n=\n5\nx = 3, y = 4, z = 5\nx\n=\n3\n,\ny\n=\n4\n,\nz\n=\n5\n)]\nThe following problem in the\nSiyuan yujian\nis reduced by Zhu to a polynomial equation of degree\n5\n(\nsee\n[\n7\n]\nfor a detailed solution as given by Zhu\n)\n:-\nLet\nd\nd\nd\nbe the diameter of the circle inscribed in a right triangle\n(\nZhu uses the relation\nd\n=\nx\n+\ny\nâ\nz\nd = x + y - z\nd\n=\nx\n+\ny\nâ\nz\nwhere\nx\n,\ny\n,\nz\nx, y, z\nx\n,\ny\n,\nz\nare as defined below\n)\n.
