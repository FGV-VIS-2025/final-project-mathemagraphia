  "biografia": "Laszlo LovÃ¡sz\nwas educated in Budapest where he showed outstanding ability in mathematics at secondary school. When he was fourteen years old, LovÃ¡sz came across an article by\nPaul ErdÅs\nin the\nMathematical and Physical Journal for Secondary Schools\n(1962)\nand was so enchanted that he read it \"at least twenty times\". In the following year he was able to meet his mathematical hero in person\n[\n3\n]\n:-\nI had the great fortune to meet\nPaul ErdÅs\nas a high school student in\n1963\n. In those days the cold war was quieting down a little, and he began to visit Hungary more and more often. ... It is an understatement to say that I have learned a lot from him, not only mathematics in the technical sense, and not even only elements of the fine art of problem solving, but also his way of pursuing knowledge: complete openness in problems and partial results, which necessarily leads to collaboration and a wider perspective.\nInspired by\nErdÅs\n, LovÃ¡sz won gold medals in the International Mathematical Olympiad competition in each of the three years\n1964\n,\n1965\nand\n1966\n. LovÃ¡sz's first paper\nOn graphs not containing independent circuits\nwas published in\n1965\nwhen he was seventeen years old. In this paper he classified graphs in which any two circuits have a common node. This was not an isolated paper for, in the next couple of years, he published\nOn decomposition of graphs\n(1966)\n,\nOperations with structures\n(1967)\n,\nÃber die starke Multiplikation von geordneten Graphen\nâ\n(\nOn the strong multiplication of ordered graphs\n)\n(1967)\n,\nOn connected sets of points\n(1967)\n, and\nOn chromatic number of finite set-systems\n(1968)\n.\nFrank Harary\ndescribes this last mentioned paper as follows:-\nP ErdÅs\nproved by probabilistic methods\n[\nin\n1959]\nthat for any positive integers\nn\n,\ng\nâ¥\n3\nn, g â¥ 3\nn\n,\ng\nâ¥\n3\n, there exists a graph with chromatic number\nn\nn\nn\nand girth â¥\ng\ng\ng\n, but was unable to construct such graphs. By generalizing the question from graphs to finite set-systems, the author succeeds in obtaining such a construction for graphs.\nAfter graduating from high school, LovÃ¡sz studied at EÃ¶tvÃ¶s LorÃ¡nd University in Budapest and he was awarded a Candidate Degree of Mathematical Science\n(\nC.Sc.\n)\nin\n1970\nby the\nHungarian Academy of Sciences\nin Budapest. At this time the Candidate Degree awarded by the\nHungarian Academy of Sciences\nwas considered a higher degree than a doctorate awarded by a university so it may appear puzzling that he received this degree first. The reason was that university regulations did not allowed a student to apply for a Ph.D. with results achieved during their undergraduate years. No such rules existed in the Academy of Sciences, however, because when the rules were drawn up it was assumed that an undergraduate would never be able to produce research of sufficient depth to entitle him to apply for the C.Sc. degree. Remarkably, LovÃ¡sz had fifteen papers in print by the time he was awarded his Candidate Degree in\n1970\n. Before the award of any degree, he had lectured at several international conferences and published papers in conference proceedings such as:\nTheory of graphs\nheld in Tihany, on the northern shore of Lake Balaton, in Hungary in September\n1966\n;\nBeitrÃ¤ge zur Graphentheorie\nâ\n(\nContributions to graph theory\n)\nheld in Manebach, Germany in May\n1967\n;\nCombinatorial Structures and their Applications\nheld at the University of Calgary in Canada in\n1969\n; and\nCombinatorial Theory and its Applications\nheld in BalatonfÃ¼red on the northern shore of Lake Balaton, in Hungary in\n1969\n.\nFor his outstanding achievements, LovÃ¡sz received the GrÃ¼nwald GÃ©za Prize from the\nBolyai\nSociety in\n1970\n. In the following year he was awarded a doctorate\n(\nDr.Rher.Nat.\n)\nfrom EÃ¶tvÃ¶s LorÃ¡nd University in Budapest for his thesis\nFactors of Graphs\n. His thesis advisor was Tibor Gallai. He was then appointed as a research assistant at EÃ¶tvÃ¶s LorÃ¡nd University, an appointment he held for four years from\n1971\nto\n1975\n. During this time he spent the year\n1972\n-\n73\nat Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee in the United States. In\n1975\nhe moved to the JÃ³zsef Attila University in Szeged where he was appointed as a\nDocent\nbut, three years later, he was promoted to professor filling the Chair of Geometry. In\n1977\nthe\nHungarian Academy of Sciences\nawarded him the degree Dr.Math.Sci. He spent the academic year\n1978\n-\n79\nat the University of Waterloo in Canada then in\n1979\n, at the age of thirty-one, he became a member of the\nHungarian Academy of Sciences\nmaking him by far the youngest member ever of the\nHungarian Academy of Sciences\n. He left Szeged in\n1983\nwhen appointed to the Chair of Computer Science at EÃ¶tvÃ¶s LorÃ¡nd University in Budapest.\nIn\n1993\nLovÃ¡sz gave up the Chair of Computer Science at EÃ¶tvÃ¶s LorÃ¡nd University but retained a professorship there. He left the Chair in Budapest to take up the William K Lanman professorship of Computer Science and Mathematics at Yale University in the United States. In\n1999\nhe left academia to take up the position of Senior Researcher at Microsoft Research but he returned to Hungary in\n2006\nto become Director of the Mathematical Institute of EÃ¶tvÃ¶s LorÃ¡nd University.\nHis research involves deep results on combinatorial optimization, algorithms, complexity, graph theory, and random walks, areas which span mathematics and theoretical computer science. He is perhaps best known for the widely used 'LLL algorithm' named after Arjen K Lenstra, Hendrik W Lenstra and LÃ¡szlÃ³ LovÃ¡sz who first gave the algorithm in their joint paper\nFactoring Polynomials with Rational Coefficients\n(1982)\n. The algorithm gives an efficient basis reduction method for point lattices. We give an indication of LovÃ¡sz's contributions by quoting from the citation for the Wolf Prize which he received in\n1999\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nLÃ¡szlÃ³ LovÃ¡sz has obtained ground-breaking results in discrete mathematics that have had significant applications to other areas of pure and applied mathematics as well as to theoretical computer science. He solved several outstanding problems, including the perfect graph conjecture, Kneser's conjecture, and the determination of the\nShannon\ncapacity of the pentagon, by introducing deep mathematical methods relying on geometric polyhedral and topological techniques. His algorithmic ideas - including applications of the ellipsoid method in combinatorial optimization, the lattice basis reduction algorithm, the matroid parity algorithm, and the improved procedures for volume computation - all had profound influence on theoretical computer science. LovÃ¡sz also contributed to the PCP characterization of NP and its connection to the hardness of approximation. His \"Local Lemma\" is one of the main early results in the development of the probabilistic method. His comprehensive books and fascinating lectures have stimulated mathematical research around the world.\nBefore looking at further honours and prizes awarded to LovÃ¡sz we give details of the outstanding books, both research monographs and teaching texts, he has written. In\n1979\nhe published\nCombinatorial problems and exercises\n(1979)\n. We quote from the Preface of this classic text:-\nHaving vegetated on the fringes of mathematical science for centuries, combinatorics has now burgeoned into one of the fastest growing branches of mathematics - undoubtedly so if we consider the number of publications in this field, its applications in other branches of mathematics and in other sciences, and also the interest of scientists, economists and engineers in combinatorial structures. The mathematical world was attracted by the successes of algebra and analysis and only in recent years has it become clear, due largely to problems arising from economics, statistics, electrical engineering and other applied sciences, that combinatorics, the study of finite sets and finite structures, has its own problems and principles. These are independent of those in algebra and analysis but match them in difficulty, practical and theoretical interest and beauty. Yet the opinion of many first-class mathematicians about combinatorics is still in the pejorative. While accepting its interest and difficulty, they deny its depth. It is often forcefully stated that combinatorics is a collection of problems which may be interesting in themselves but are not linked and do not constitute a theory. It is easy to obtain new results in combinatorics or graph theory because there are few techniques to learn, and this results in a fast-growing number of publications. The above accusations are clearly characteristic of any field of science at an early stage of its development - at the stage of collecting data. As long as the main questions have not been formulated and the abstractions to a general level have not been carried through, there is no way to distinguish between interesting and less interesting results - except on an aesthetic basis, which is, of course, too subjective. Those techniques whose absence has been disapproved of above await their discoverers. So underdevelopment is not a case against, but rather for, directing young scientists toward a given field. In my opinion, combinatorics is now growing out of this early stage. There are techniques to learn: enumeration techniques, matroid theory, the probabilistic method, linear programming, block design constructions, etc. There are branches which consist of theorems forming a hierarchy and which contain central structure theorems forming the backbone of study: connectivity of graphs\n(\nnetwork flows\n)\nor factors of graphs, just to pick two examples from graph theory. There are notions abstracted from many nontrivial results, which unify large parts of the theory, such as matroids or the concept of good characterization. My feeling is that it is no longer possible to obtain significant results without the knowledge of these facts, concepts and techniques.\n(\nOf course, exceptions may occur, since the field is destined to cover such a large part of the world of mathematics that entirely new problems may still arise.\n)\nFrank Harary\nbegan a review of the book as follows:-\nThis book is a classic. The author masterfully analyzes the proof techniques utilized in\n607\ndifferent results partitioned into  ... fifteen sections.\nIn\n1993\nLovÃ¡sz produced a second edition, writing in the Preface:-\nWhen the publishers of this book asked me to revise and update my problem book for a second edition, I had to decide how much to change, taking into consideration the fast development of the field\n(\nbut also that the first edition was out of print\n)\n. Combinatorics has grown a lot in the last decade, especially in those fields interacting with other branches of mathematics, like polyhedral combinatorics, algebraic combinatorics, combinatorial geometry, random structures and, most significantly, algorithmic combinatorics and complexity theory.\n(\nThe theory of computing has so many applications in combinatorics, and vice versa, that sometimes it is difficult to draw the border between them.\n)\nBut combinatorics is a discipline in its own right, and this makes this collection of exercises\n(\nsubject to some updating\n)\nstill valid. I decided not to change the structure and main topics of the book. Any conceptual change\n(\nlike introducing algorithmic issues consistently, together with an analysis of the algorithms and the complexity classification of the algorithmic problems\n)\nwould have meant writing a new book. I could not resist, however, working out a series of exercises on random walks on graphs, and their relations to eigenvalues, expansion properties, and electrical resistance\n(\nthis area has classical roots but has grown explosively in the last few years\n)\n.\nOther books by LovÃ¡sz are\n(\nwith Michael D Plummer\n)\nMatching theory\n(1986)\nabout which Knut Richter writes:-\nThis excellent book is mainly addressed to insiders of graph theory, combinatorics and discrete optimization.\nAlso in\n1986\n,\nAn algorithmic theory of numbers, graphs and convexity\nwas published. Arjen Lenstra writes:-\nThis book presents a nice survey of some recent developments towards the efficient solution of computational problems in areas like graph theory, number theory, and combinatorial optimization.\nTwo years later LovÃ¡sz published\n(\nwith Martin GrÃ¶tschel and Alexander Schrijver\n)\nGeometric algorithms and combinatorial optimization\n(1988)\n; a second edition appeared in\n1993\n. JÃ¼rgen KÃ¶hler reviewed the first edition:-\nThe authors review modern developments in mathematical optimization, discuss classical results and present many new results. ... The authors present, on a high level, a great number of results on this topic and give them their best form: this is an optimal monograph.\nNext, written in collaboration with Bernhard Korte and Rainer Schrader, he published\nGreedoids\n(1991)\n. Ulrich Faigle explains:-\nThere are two fundamentally different aspects of greedoids. One may think of greedoids as set systems obeying a relaxation of the matroid independence axioms in that not necessarily every subset of an independent set is independent. Viewed from this angle, structural theory of greedoids amounts to the question of how much of matroid theory is retained under this relaxed axiomatic assumption. The second aspect sees greedoids as finite languages over alphabets that are closed with respect to taking prefixes of words and have the property that any nonmaximal word may be augmented with some letter in any longer word.\nIn\n2003\nhe wrote the textbook\n(\nwith Josef Pelikan and Katalin L Vesztergombi\n)\nDiscrete mathematics\n. Robin Wilson writes:-\nIn recent years there has been a plethora of textbooks on discrete mathematics, designed as a counter-balance to the over-emphasis on calculus in colleges and universities. This book is a welcome addition to these, being written in a delightfully informal style by three well-known practitioners in the field.\nIn addition to the GrÃ¼nwald GÃ©za Prize mentioned above, LovÃ¡sz was awarded: the George PÃ³lya Prize in\n1979\n; the Best Information Theory Paper Award from the IEEE in\n1981\n; the Ray D Fulkerson Prize awarded jointly to Lovasz, GrÃ¶tschel and Schrijver for their paper\nThe ellipsoid method and its consequences in combinatorial optimisation\n(1981)\n; the State Prize, Hungary in\n1985\n; the Tibor Szele Medal from the\nBolyai\nSociety in\n1992\n; the\nBrouwer\nMedal from the\nDutch Mathematical Society\nin\n1993\n; the National Order of Merit of Hungary in\n1998\n; the\nBolzano\nMedal from the Czech Mathematical Society in\n1998\n; the Wolf Prize, Israel in\n1999\n; and the\nKnuth\nPrize in\n1999\n. The citation for this award reads:-\nLovÃ¡sz had an enormous influence on the theory of algorithms. He has made fundamental discoveries that have became standard tools in theoretical computer science. The LovÃ¡sz Local lemma, Lattice Basis Reduction - finding short vectors in lattices, and the application of the ellipsoid method for various convex programming problems have all become standard tools in a wide range of areas of algorithms and complexity. LovÃ¡sz's contribution to the connection between hardness of approximation and probabilistic proofs was essential. In addition to his fundamental contributions in algorithms Laci LovÃ¡sz has also written a number of beautiful books all emphasizing algorithms in a variety of topics.\nContinuing to honours given in the present millennium, he received the Corvin Chain from the Hungarian Government in\n2001\nand the\nGÃ¶del\nPrize in\n2001\nfor the paper\nInteractive Proofs and the Hardness of Approximating Cliques\nwritten with Uriel Feige, Shafi Goldwasser, Shmuel Safra and Mario Szegedy. In\n2006\nthe Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences awarded LovÃ¡sz its\nJohn von Neumann\nTheory Prize. The award came with the following citation:-\nLÃ¡szlÃ³ LovÃ¡sz has held positions at universities in Hungary and the US as well as at Microsoft Research and is presently the director of the Mathematical Institute of the EÃ¶tvÃ¶s LorÃ¡nd University in Budapest. He first became well known when he proved the Perfect Graph Conjecture in\n1972\n, at the age of\n24\n. In\n1979\nhe solved a long-standing problem of\nC Shannon\nin coding theory by assigning vectors to the vertices of a graph and formulating an associated semidefinite programming problem; the approach has since become a powerful tool in attacking combinatorial optimization problems. In\n1991\n, he and Schrijver showed the power of lift-and-project methods in\n0\n-\n1\ninteger programming problems and the potential of semidefinite programming techniques to obtain tight relaxations. LovÃ¡sz has also made key contributions to many topics in graph theory using novel techniques, to randomized algorithms and to submodular function minimization. LovÃ¡sz will become the President of the International Mathematical Union next year. He is a member of the Hungarian, European, Russian and Dutch Academies of Sciences.\nLovÃ¡sz was awarded the\nJÃ¡nos Bolyai\nResearch Prize in\n2007\n, elected to the\nSwedish Academy of Sciences\nin the same year, and awarded Hungary's SzÃ©chenyi Grand Prize on\n15\nMarch\n2008\n. He received the Advanced Grant of the European Research Council in August\n2008\n. In November\n2008\nLovÃ¡sz was awarded the\nBolyai\nGrand Prize of the\nJÃ¡nos Bolyai\nFoundation and, on\n3\nJuly\n2009\n, he was elected an honorary member of the\nLondon Mathematical Society\n. In\n2010\nhe was awarded the Kyoto Prize by the Inamori Foundation, in\n2012\nhe was awarded the\nAmerican Mathematical Society\nFulkerson prize and in\n2019\nhe was awarded the Barcelona Hypatia European Science Prize.\nSee\nTHIS LINK\n.\nFinally we mention that, in\n1990\n, he was a plenary speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians held in Kyoto. His lecture\nGeometric algorithms and algorithmic geometry\nappeared in the conference proceeding and also as a video. He was also a plenary speaker at the British Mathematical Colloquium at Exeter in\n1988\nwhen he lectured on\nLattice points in convex bodies\n.\nHe has served as president of the\nInternational Mathematical Union\nsince January\n1\n,\n2007\n. He is married with four children."
