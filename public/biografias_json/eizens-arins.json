  "biografia": "Eizens Arins\nwas born in Krasnoyarsk, a city on the Yenisey River and the administrative centre of the Krasnoyarsk Region in east-central Russia. After the arrival of the Trans-Siberian Railway in the\n1890\ns which crossed the Yenisey River at Krasnoyarsk, the city developed rapidly and spread onto the right bank of the Yenisey River. Arins' parents were Latvian workers but were in exile in Siberia at the time of his birth. He was born at a time when Latvia was dominated by Russia, as it had been from the end of the\n18\nth\ncentury, and the domination would continue until World War I.\nDuring\n1917\nthe Russian domination of Latvia ended and, after a brief period of German invasion, the country became independent in a proclamation made on\n18\nNovember\n1918\n. Arins mother died in exile in Siberia in\n1918\n, but in\n1921\nArins and his father returned to the then independent country of Latvia. Arins attended secondary school in Daugavpils\n(\nGerman DÃ¼naburg, Russian Dvinsk\n)\nwhich is a city in southeastern Latvia on the Western Daugava River. Much damage had occurred to the city in World War I, when the front line lay on the Western Daugava, so it was still in a relatively poor state when Arins attended the\nGymnasium\nthere.\nIn\n1929\nArins graduated from the school in Daugavpils and he entered the University of Latvia in Riga in\n1930\n. Coming from a poor family he had to find a way to support himself financially through his university studies, so he worked as a clerk for the insurance company. This meant that he studies took considerably longer than would have been the case if he had been able to concentrate fully on them. At the time of the outbreak of World war II he had still not completed his degree.\nThe German-Soviet Nonaggression Pact was signed in August\n1939\nand from that time on Latvia had no chance of remaining an independent country. On\n17\nJune\n1940\nthe Red Army invaded Latvia and only three days later a new government of Soviet supporters was announced. They voted on\n21\nJuly for Latvia to become a part of the USSR and on\n5\nAugust this became official. The Soviet occupation saw around\n35\n,\n000\nLatvians deported to Russia within a year. During this extremely difficult period the University of Latvia continued to operate and Arins continued his undergraduate studies. However, the German army invaded Latvia in July\n1941\n. For a period Latvia was a province of a larger Ostland\n(\nincluding Estonia, Lithuania, and Byelorussia\n)\n. Despite the take-over of the country by Germany, the University of Latvia remained open and in September\n1941\nArins graduated. At this stage he found a career for himself as a mathematician in the insurance company.\nIn\n1944\nthe Soviet army again marched into Latvia and in October of that year, after the Soviet army defeated German forces in a battle for Riga, a renewed period of Soviet domination began. In December of that year Arins began lecturing in the Faculty of Physics and Mathematics of the University of Latvia. However now the Soviet authorities were making strenuous efforts to transform the country into a typical Soviet one with policies of severe political repression and extreme Russification of Latvia. Arins had graduated at a time when the country had been under German rule, and the Soviet authorities now refused to recognise his degree, He had to graduate again under the new regime which he did in\n1946\n. Over the next five years he lectured at the university and undertook research at the Institute of Physics of the\nLatvian Academy of Sciences\n.\nArins then continued his postgraduate studies at Moscow State University where his doctorate was supervised by\nL V Keldysh\n.\nLyudmila Vsevolodovna Keldysh\nwas a professor at Moscow State University and an outstanding mathematician who made important contributions to set theory and geometric\ntopology\n. Under her supervision Arins wrote a thesis on partially continuous functions on products of topological spaces which he defended in\n1954\n. He returned to Latvia where he was appointed as a\ndozent\nat the university in\n1955\n. From\n1956\nto\n1960\nhe again undertook research at the Institute of Physics of the\nLatvian Academy of Sciences\n.\nIn\n1959\nthe University of Latvia established a Computing Centre with Arins as the founder, first director, and organiser. This Centre became a research establishment where research in computer science and mathematics was carried out\n[\n5\n]\n:-\n[\nArins\n]\nwrote papers on the descriptive theory of functions ..., theoretical computer science, and cybernetics.\nArins showed great organisational skills in developing the Computing Centre and soon he was joined by\nGrinbergs\nwho contributed in a major way to the work of the Centre."
