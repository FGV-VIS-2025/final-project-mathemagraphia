  "biografia": "Kazimierz Å»orawski\n's parents were Juliusz Bronislaw Wiktor Å»orawski\n(1833\n-\n1905)\nand Kazimiera Kamienska. Juliusz had not had much of an education due to the political and economic problems in Poland during the time he was growing up. However, he did very well for himself becoming a farmer, then going on to run an experimental agricultural station. He also was a shareholder in the Krasiniec sugar refinery. Kazimiera, Kazimierz's mother, was a strong supporter of Poland which at this time was partitioned between Russia, Prussia, and Austria. There were a number of groups in Poland who conspired against this foreign rule. One of these groups was the Reds who organised demonstrations in Warsaw in\n1861\n. These were harshly suppressed by Russian troops leading to several deaths. Russia decided to break up the Reds by drafting large numbers of them into the Russian army. In January\n1863\nthe Reds reacted against this by calling for an uprising against the Russians. Kazimiera, and her father, took part in this uprising and they were captured by the Russians. Both were imprisoned and although Kazimiera was released, her father died in prison in Warsaw.\nKazimierz was one of his parents' six children. He had three brothers WÅadysÅaw, Juliusz, and StanisÅaw, and two sisters Bronislawa and Anna. It was at a\nGymnasium\nin Warsaw that he completed his secondary education in\n1884\nand then entered the University of Warsaw to study mathematics. A major event in his life occurred in the following year when a young eighteen year old girl, Maria Sklodowska, was employed as a governess to the Å»orawski family.\nFor readers of this archive who do not recognise the name Maria Sklodowska, let us suggest that you will recognise her by her married name of Marie Curie, the famous physicist who was twice a winner of the Nobel Prize for her work on radioactivity. Maria's father was a teacher of mathematics and physics who had lost his savings through bad investments. In an attempt to help with the family's education, Maria took on the position of governess. From her earnings as the Å»orawski family governess she aimed to finance her sister Bronia's medical studies in Paris, on the understanding that Bronia would in turn later help her to get an education. Kazimierz and Maria fell in love and wanted to marry. However Å»orawski's parents refused to consent to the marriage since Maria's family were too poor. For several years Kazimierz and Maria hoped that Kazimierz's parents would relent and approve the marriage, but this never happened.\nIn\n1888\n, after four years at the University of Warsaw, Å»orawski graduated with a first degree in mathematics. His work was of such high quality that he was given the opportunity to continue his mathematical studies abroad. He spent time in Leipzig where he studied continuous groups of transformations now called\nLie\ngroups, and GÃ¶ttingen where he studied differential equations. He was awarded his doctorate in\n1891\nfrom the University of Leipzig for his thesis on the applications of Lie groups to\ndifferential geometry\n.\nLie\nhad been appointed to Leipzig in\n1886\nto succeed\nKlein\n.\nEngel\nwas also at Leipzig and at the time when Å»orawski studied their they were working on their major work\nTheorie der Transformationsgruppen\nâ\n(\nTheory of transformation groups\n)\nwhich was published in three volumes between\n1888\nand\n1893\n.\nLie\nlater said:-\nAmong the work done in Leipzig, let us remember in particular the superb work of Å»orawski on integral invariants. With much ability, Å»orawski worked to resolve difficult and complicated calculations which were necessary to solve the problems ...\nIt was in\n1891\nthat Maria Sklodowska went to Paris to begin her education supported by her sister, and Kazimierz and Maria's hopes of being able to marry finally came to an end. Å»orawski was appointed as a lecturer at the LwÃ³w Polytechnic\n(\nnow in Lviv in Ukraine\n)\nin\n1892\nand was promoted to professor in the Mechanical Engineering Department in the following year. He\nhabilitated\nat the Jagiellonian University in KrakÃ³w in\n1893\n, then went to Berlin in\n1895\nto study geodesy. After returning to the Jagiellonian University of KrakÃ³w he was named extraordinary professor on\n1\nMay\n1895\n, being promoted to ordinary professor of mathematics in\n1898\n. In\n1900\nStanisÅaw Zaremba\nwas also appointed as professor at the Jagiellonian University and together Å»orawski and\nZaremba\nbuilt a major school of mathematics. After Å»orawski's death,\nÅlebodziÅski\nwrote:-\nOne can say that, thanks to these two scientists, Polish mathematics ceased being a mere consumer of foreign thinking and analysis. Both played pivotal roles in the development of this science. Under the political conditions of the time,\nStanisÅaw Zaremba\nand Kazimierz Å»orawski were, for fifteen years, the only representatives of cutting-edge Polish mathematics ... judging these facts by contrasting them with the current state of affairs, shows their immense progress and accomplishments ... in spite of the catastrophic effects on Polish mathematics caused by the Nazi occupation.\nA government grant allowed Å»orawski to visit both Leipzig and Paris during the winter semester\n1901\n-\n02\nto further his studies. After returning to KrakÃ³w, Å»orawski continued to teach courses on analytical and synthetic geometry, differential geometry, the formal theory of the differential equations, the theory of the forms, and the theory of the\nLie groups\n. The main topics of his research were invariants of differential forms, integral invariants of Lie groups, differential geometry, and fluid mechanics. Let us quote the titles of two of Å»orawski's papers which were written in German and published during his time in KrakÃ³w:\nÃber infinitesimale Transformationen der Ebene, welche gewissen geometrischen Bedingungen genÃ¼gen\nâ\n(\nOn infinitesimal transformations of the plane which satisfy certain geometric conditions\n)\n(1901)\nand\nÃber Eigenschaften eines vielfachen Integrals, welche Verallgemeinerungen zweier SÃ¤tze der Theorie der Wirbelbewegung sind\nâ\n(\nOn characteristics of a multiple integral which generalizations of two sets of the theory of vortex motion are\n)\n(1913)\n. He remained in KrakÃ³w during the years of World War I. After the war ended with the surrender of the Central Powers, Poland proclaimed itself independent on\n11\nNovember\n1918\n.\nWe related above the story of how Å»orawski and Maria Sklodowska wished to marry but were unable to do so because of Å»orawski's parents. Of course, as is well known, Maria Sklodowska married Pierre Curie in Paris in\n1895\n. Å»orawski married Leokadia Jewniewicz, the daughter of Maria Moszczynska and Hipolit Jewniewicz. Hipolit was a professor of applied mathematics at St Petersburg and had a major text\nThe Theory of Elasticity\npublished posthumously in Warsaw in\n1910\n. Leokadia was a talented pianist. Kazimierz and Leokadia Å»orawski had three children, Juliusz, Leokadia and Maria.\nAn informal Mathematical Society was established in KrakÃ³w in\n1917\n, and Å»orawski was one of several mathematicians directly involved with setting up this new society. It was officially constituted after the end of World War I. At\n5\np.m. on\n2\nApril\n1919\na meeting was held in the Philosophy Seminar at\n12\nSt Anne Street, KrakÃ³w, at which the Mathematical Society was constituted. Among the sixteen mathematicians present were\nStefan Banach\n,\nOtto Nikodym\n,\nStanisÅaw Zaremba\n, and Kazimierz Å»orawski. The session was introduced by Å»orawski who said that an all-Polish Mathematical Society was being set up in Warsaw, and he proposed a motion to initiate a 'Mathematical Society in KrakÃ³w' which might later become associated with the new Warsaw Society. The motion was passed unanimously and\nStanisÅaw Zaremba\nwas elected to preside over the Constituting Session. Soon after this, later in the year\n1919\n, Å»orawski moved to Warsaw where he accepted a professorship at the Technical University. He also taught at the University of Warsaw. When the various Polish mathematical societies combined in\n1920\ninto the\nPolish Mathematical Society\n, Å»orawski became a founder member of the new Society. Also in\n1920\nhe was elected to the\nWarsaw Scientific Society\nand served as president of this society from\n1926\nto\n1931\n. His great contributions to the\nWarsaw Scientific Society\nwere marked by the Society with the creation of the Commemorative Å»orawski Medal in\n1931\n.\nIn\n1926\nÅ»orawski became a professor at the University of Warsaw and continued in this role until he retired in\n1935\n. Retirement meant that his formal responsibilities at the university had ended but this meant that he had more time to now undertake the writing of a major mathematical work on analytical geometry. He was progressing with this major project when World War II broke out. Å»orawski remained in Warsaw and continued to make progress on his many volume treatise. As July\n1944\nwas drawing to a close the Russian army was advancing into Poland. The Russians encouraged the Poles in Warsaw to stage an uprising against the occupying German forces, promising help. The Poles did exactly that and soon took control of the city. However when German reinforcements were sent in and the Russians, despite having their army close by, refused to help the uprising and, even more serious for the Poles, refused to allow the Allies to use their air bases to supply the Poles fighting in the city, the uprising was crushed after over two months. The Germans then systematically deported the city's population and destroyed the city itself. Å»orawski, along with many thousands of the inhabitants of Warsaw, was taken by the Germans to PruszkÃ³w. His house and the three-quarters finished multi-volume work he had been writing on analytical geometry were destroyed.\nAfter some time Å»orawski was released from PruszkÃ³w and he went with a number of other scientists to NieborÃ³w. After the war ended and Russian troops had completely occupied Poland, Å»orawski returned to Warsaw where his daughter Leokadia Paprocka was living. After living with his daughter of a while the Ministry for Education gave him a small bedroom with a kitchen in a students' dormitory in Narutowicz. Remarkably, Å»orawski then set about rewriting his book which had been destroyed following the Warsaw Uprising. He rewrote about two-thirds of the book, amounting to\n2650\npages.\nÅ»orawski was elected a full member of the\nPolish Academy of Sciences\nin\n1952\n. He also was honoured with the Commander's Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta and the Gold Cross of Merit. After he died in early\n1953\nhis family received a telegram from\nBronislaw Knaster\n,\nEdward Marczewski\n,\nHugo Steinhaus\n, and\nWÅadysÅaw ÅlebodziÅski\nwhich read:-\n... we wish to express to the family of Professor Kazimierz Å»orawski our deep compassion. He was the first of the scientists of his generation to bring the name of Poland to the forefront of world mathematics."
