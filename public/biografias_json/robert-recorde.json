  "biografia": "Robert Recorde\n's parents were Thomas Recorde and Rose Jones. Thomas Recorde's father was from Wales and Rose Jones was the daughter of Thomas Jones from Machynlleth in Montgomeryshire. Robert was the second son of Thomas and Rose and, although the date is not definitely known, it is thought that he entered the University of Oxford in about\n1525\n. Again we do not know the topics he studied but we do know that he graduated with a B.A. in\n1531\nand was elected a Fellow of All Souls College, Oxford in that year.\nAll Souls was a graduate College at this time endowed for the study of Church music. It trained men in theology, law and medicine. Certainly we know that he studied medicine at Oxford and was a highly educated man. In later life he was interested in history, collecting British antiquities and manuscripts, and he was an expert in the Anglo-Saxon language. It is reasonable to suppose that he gained his love of antiquities at All Souls College for John Leyland, who was in\n1531\nchaplain and librarian to King Henry VIII employed by the King for his expertise in antiquities and manuscripts, had studies at All Souls at the same time as, or slightly before, Recorde.\nIt is likely that following his election to a fellowship in\n1531\nRecorde taught at Oxford for a few years but there are no records to prove this. The next that we know for certain is that he went to Cambridge and studied there for his M.D. There is a record at Cambridge which states that Recorde received a license in medicine in Oxford twelve years earlier and this almost certainly means that Recorde received the degree of B.M. from Oxford although again no record of this has been found. He graduated from Cambridge in\n1545\n, receiving the degree of M.D. He may have taught at Cambridge following the award of his degree but all we know for certain is that some time during two years following\n1545\nhe moved to London where he practised medicine.\nHenry VIII died on\n28\nJanuary\n1547\nand his son Edward, by his third wife Jane Seymour, succeeded to the throne. Edward was only ten years old and Edward Seymour, duke of Somerset, was appointed regent with the title of protector. Recorde was in London, practicing medicine at the time of Edward's succession. In the following year the privy council asked Recorde to examine someone who had been imprisoned in the Tower of London charged with claiming to be a false prophet. In\n1549\nRecorde was appointed controller of the Bristol mint.\nSeymour effectively governed the country until October\n1549\nwhen he was overthrown by John Dudley, earl of Warwick who later received the title duke of Northumberland. Sir William Herbert was a governor to the young king Edward VI, and helped to suppress the rebellion in Wiltshire, Devon, and Cornwall in\n1549\n. He tried to get money diverted to support his army in this venture but Recorde refused on the grounds that the orders were not from the King. Herbert accused Recorde of treason, removed him from control of the Bristol mint which ceased production. Recorde was confined to the court for sixty days.\nIn\n1551\nRecorde was back in favour for he was appointed by the King to be general surveyor of the mines and monies in Ireland. In this capacity he was in charge of silver mines in Wexford and technical supervisor of the Dublin mint. Silver was important in the King's financial strategy for Edward VI restored an English coinage of silver. It is interesting that he introduced the silver crown of five shillings which was the first English coin to have a date written in Arabic numerals rather than Roman numerals. When we say that Recorde was back in favour, it must be understood that his quarrel with Sir William Herbert had never been settled and there continued to be animosity between the two. Herbert became of increasing importance in the country and, in October\n1551\n, was created Baron Herbert of Cardiff and Earl of Pembroke.\nThe silver mines in Wexford did not become a successful venture for Recorde. There were a great many problems, all outside his control, which meant that the project never had a chance to succeed. The technology needed to mine the silver was the subject of a dispute with German miners who operated the mines. In addition the treasury would have needed to invest a great deal of money in the venture before they would have seen a return and this they were not able, or perhaps not willing, to do. The Earl of Pembroke certainly did not give Recorde support and by\n1553\n, with the mines showing a loss, the project was closed down and Recorde was recalled to England.\nThere were other difficulties which were caused by the illness of Edward VI. He showed the first signs of tuberculosis in January\n1553\nand various factions sought to influence his successor, particularly after May when it was clear to everyone that he was quite close to death. Edward VI died on\n6\nJuly and Lady Jane Grey, the duke of Northumberland's daughter-in-law, ruled from\n10\nJuly to\n19\nJuly before being overthrown by Mary I, a daughter of King Henry VIII. The Church of England had been established in\n1534\nby Mary's father and Recorde was a supporter of the Reformation. However, Mary sought to reestablish the Roman Catholic Church in England and after she married Philip II of Spain in\n1554\nthey brought back the laws against heresy. During the next three years over\n300\nheretics were burned at the stake earning her the title \"bloody Mary\".\nThe Earl of Pembroke, Recorde's enemy, attended the proclamation of Mary I in London. Mary rewarded his loyalty by making him a privy councillor. When it became clear that Mary would marry Philip there was a rebellion and Pembroke led Mary's troops against the rebels in early in\n1554\n. It was really a very stupid move on Recorde's part, therefore, when in\n1556\nhe attempted to charge Pembroke with misconduct in order to regain his court position. Of course it is almost certain that Recorde had a valid case against Pembroke but there was no way that someone so close to Mary and Philip would allow a minor civil servant like Recorde to get the better of him.\nPembroke countered Recorde's charges by suing Recorde for libel, the bill being served on\n16\nOctober\n1556\n. The hearing took place in January\n1557\nand, almost inevitably, the Earl of Pembroke won his action against Recorde. The award of Â£\n1000\nwhich Recorde was ordered to pay to Pembroke was made on\n10\nFebruary. Either Recorde could not pay this sum, or he chose not to, for he was imprisoned. If indeed he could not pay it was doubly unfortunate for Recorde since he was owed exactly this amount for his services in Ireland which he had never received. In fact the Â£\n1000\nfor his work in Ireland was paid to his estate in\n1570\n, but this was not much use to him as, by this time, he had been dead for twelve years. In the King's Bench prison in Southwark, he made a will on\n28\nJune\n1558\nleaving small amounts of money to his four sons and five daughters. He died in the prison, probably no more than a few weeks later.\nIf Recorde showed little common sense in his argument with the Earl of Pembroke, this was in stark contrast to the remarkable good sense and learning which he showed in all his academic work. Recorde virtually established the English school of mathematics and first introduced algebra into England.\nHe wrote many elementary textbooks and he did this with a very deliberate policy in mind. Firstly he wanted to produce a complete course of mathematical instruction and he wrote his books in the order in which he thought that they should be studied in a mathematics course. It was a course of study which he wanted to be available to everyone, not just the few educated men who could read Latin or Greek. He therefore wrote all his books in English and, in addition, he tried to use clear and simple expressions. In order to do this he had to introduce many new English words to be the equivalent of the Latin or Greek terms in use at that time. It would be nice to think that some of these carefully chosen terms might have survived, but sadly none of them have.\nAnyone who reads Recorde's works will be led to believe that, although no evidence survives, he must have taught for some time since he has a deep understanding of how to teach. Ideas are developed clearly step by step, with difficult points being left until the student has gained enough experience to understand them. Although he used the works of others as a basis for much of his work, he certainly did not follow these slavishly, rather picking the best ideas and discarding others. It is clear that when he read a book he always did so critically which, although not remarkable today, certainly was in the\n16\nth\ncentury when education was still largely based on slavishly following the classic writers without question.\nRecorde published\nThe Grounde of Artes\nin\n1543\nwhich was a very successful commercial arithmetic book:-\n... teaching the perfect work and practice of Arithmeticke etc.\nin Recorde's own words. The book discusses operations with Arabic numerals, computation with counters, proportion, the 'rule of three', all arithmetic being studied for the natural numbers in the first version which had second and third editons in\n1549\nand\n1550\n. In\n1552\nRecorde published a second enlarged version of\nThe Grounde of Artes\nextending the work of the first edition to\nrational\nas well as whole numbers and including such topics as 'false position'.\nIn\n1551\nRecorde wrote\nPathwaie to Knowledge\nwhich some consider an abridged version of Euclid's\nElements\n. It is the only one of his books not written in the form of a dialogue between a master and scholar. No proofs are given in this book but instead Recorde explains why the theorems are true and gives examples to aid a student to understand not only what was being taught, but also why it was being taught.\nThe Castle of Knowledge\nwas first published in\n1556\nand gives an elementary introduction to\nPtolemy\n's version of astronomy. It is therefore essentially a mathematical work on the sphere and Recorde certainly read works by\nPtolemy\n,\nProclus\n,\nSacrobosco\nand\nOronce Fine\nbefore writing his text. We know that he had read these works for he states this in the text and also gives a critical account of the works correcting textural errors in them. It is in this work that\nCopernicus\n's heliocentric theory is mentioned, and although Recorde does not say that he himself believes the theory, many historians feel that he probably did. We mentioned above how Mary I had reestablished the Catholic Church and the laws of heresy in\n1554\nand that many heretics were burned. It may be that here Recorde showed more common sense than he did over the Pembroke affair of\n1556\n, and chose not to commit himself to\nCopernicus\n's theory. He wrote:-\nCopernicus a man of great learning, of much experience, and of wonderful diligence in observation, hath renewed the opinion of\nAristarchus\nSainius, and affirmith that the earth not only moveth circularly about his own centre, but also may be, yea and is, continually out of the precise centre of the world\n38\nhundred thousand miles: but because the understanding of that controversy dependeth upon profounder knowledge than in this Introduction may be uttered conveniently, I will let it pass till some other time.\nThe 'equals' symbol '=' appears in Recorde's book\nThe Whetstone of Witte\npublished in\n1557\n. He justifies using two parallel line segments:-\n... bicause noe\n2\nthynges can be moare equalle .\nThe symbol = was not immediately popular. The symbol || was used by some and\nae\n(\nor\noe\n)\n, from the word 'aequalis' meaning equal, was widely used into the\n1700\ns.\nThere is more to\nThe Whetstone of Witte\nthan the equals sign of course. First let us comment on the title which greatly puzzles many people. It is actually a clever pun by Recorde which, sadly, is incomprehensible to people today without explanation.\nCosa\nis Latin for a 'thing' which was used for the unknown in early algebra. Algebraists were called cossists and algebra was known as the cossic art for many years. For example in\n1525\nRudolff\npublished the book\nCoss\nwhich was the first German algebra text. The word\ncos\nis Latin for\nwhetstone\n, a stone for sharpening razors and tools. Hence the pun - it was an algebra book on which to sharpen one's mathematical wit!\nThe book was dedicated to the Muscovy Company which was an association of merchant adventurers founded by the explorer Sebastian Cabot in\n1555\nand given a monopoly of Anglo-Russian trade. The Company also had as one of its aims to the search for the Northeast Passage. It seems that Recorde advised the Muscovy Company on navigation.\nThe book was the Second Part of Arithmetic,\nThe Grounde of Artes\nbeing the first, covering the extraction of roots, the theory of equations and arithmetic with surds. In his study of quadratic equations, Recorde does not allow solutions which are negative, but he does allow negative coefficients. He makes good use of the sum and product of the roots stressing that for the equation\nx\n2\n=\np\nx\nâ\nq\nx^{2} = px - q\nx\n2\n=\np\nx\nâ\nq\nthe sum of the roots is\np\np\np\nand their product is\nq\nq\nq\n.\nOne further comment on this algebra book. For many years\nStifel\nwas considered as Recorde's major source, but in\n[\n5\n]\nHughes argues convincingly that\nAlgebrae compendiosa\nby J Scheubel published in Paris in\n1551\nis Recorde's major source.\nFinally we note that Recorde did write a medical text\nThe Urinal of Physick\n(1547)\nwhich is\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nA traditional medical work on the judgement of urines, full of sensible nursing practice,\n[\nbut\n]\nless modern than his mathematical works and less critical of authority."
