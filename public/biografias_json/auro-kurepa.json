  "biografia": "Äuro Kurepa\n's parents were Rade and Andelija Kurepa. He was born into a large family, being the youngest of his parents' fourteen children. For the first few years of his life he was living in an area linked to Austro-Hungary, but when he was eleven years old Croatia, Slavonia, and Dalmatia proclaimed themselves an independent state. Shortly after this the newly created Croatia entered into a state union with Serbia, Slovenia, and Montenegro. Kurepa attended elementary school in Majske Poljane, the small town in which he was born, then moved to the nearby town of Glina to continue his education. He completed his high school education in Krizevci before entering the University of Zagreb. Kurepa graduated in\n1931\nwith a degree in pure mathematics and physics, then spent a year teaching as an assistant in mathematics at the University of Zagreb. He went to Paris in\n1932\nto undertake research at the Faculty of Science and the CollÃ¨ge de France.\nIn Paris Kurepa was advised by\nMaurice FrÃ©chet\nand he submitted his thesis\nEnsembles ordonnÃ©s et ramifiÃ©s\nâ\n(\nOrdered and branched sets\n)\nto the Sorbonne in\n1935\n. The committee set up to examine the dissertation consisted of\nP Montel\nas president,\nM FrÃ©chet\nas supervisor, and\nA Denjoy\n. Kurepa's doctoral dissertation is given in\n[\n1\n]\n. It is discussed in\n[\n7\n]\nwhere Grulovic points out that Kurepa was the first to introduce the notion of a partially well-ordered set in this dissertation\n(\nunder the name of \"tableaux ramifiÃ©s\"\n)\n. He also notes that a significant part of Kurepa's results is related to establishing:-\n... a connection between the properties of partially well-ordered sets and\nCantor\n's problem, that is, between the properties of partially well-ordered sets and\nSuslin\n's problem of the continuum.\nKurepa introduced the concept of aÂ\npseudometric space\nÂ which is aÂ generalizationÂ of aÂ metric spaceÂ in which the distance between two distinct points can be zero. The spaces have turned out to be important in functional analysis.\nAfter the award of his doctorate Kurepa continued to undertake research, first at the University of Warsaw, then in\n1937\nback again in Paris. He was appointed as an assistant professor at the University of Zagreb in\n1937\n, being promoted to associate professor in the following year.\nThe political situation had been difficult between the two world wars with serious differences between those favouring an independent Croatia and the Serbs who favoured centralisation. During World War II Germany and Italy set up a puppet Croatian government in Zagreb in\n1941\n. It collapsed shortly after Germany surrendered in\n1945\nand Kurepa found himself in the newly formed Yugoslavia. After the end of Word War II, Kurepa went to the United States. There he visited Harvard University, the University of Chicago, the University of California at Berkeley and at Los Angeles, and the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton. Back in Zagreb, he was made a full professor in\n1948\n. In\n1952\nhe was invited to visit the University of Belgrade. There he\n[\n6\n]\n:-\n... gave talks on the theory of matrices, and held a seminar with topics in set theory, topology and algebra.\nKurepa continued his links with Belgrade through the\n1950\ns, then in\n1965\nhe was invited to fill a chair of mathematics at the University of Belgrade. He accepted the position and remained there until he retired in\n1977\n.\nGrulovic, in\n[\n7\n]\n, refers to:-\n[\nKurepa's\n]\nexceptionally full, diverse and rich creative work ...\nThe topics which Kurepa investigated are very varied but lie mostly within topology, set theory and number theory. He published over\n200\npapers but this number rises to over\n700\nitems if we include books, articles and reviews. He was fascinated by the continuum hypothesis and the\naxiom of choice\n. Perhaps best known is his work on trees and partitions, especially Aronszajn and\nSuslin\ntrees. His book The\nTheory of Sets\nwritten in Serbo-Croatian and published in\n1951\nillustrates his interests in that particular area. After introducing the fundamental concepts and elementary operations in Chapter\n1\n, he looks at cardinal numbers in the second chapter, then partially ordered sets and ordinal numbers in the third. Chapter\n4\nis on topological and metric spaces, with the fifth and final chapter on limiting processes in analysis, measure theory,\nBorel\nand Souslin sets.\nIn number theory he made many contributions, but perhaps his most famous is his open problem on the left factorial function. In\n1971\nhe published his definition of\n!\nn\n!n\n!\nn\n, the left factorial function, defined by\n!\nn\n=\n0\n!\n+\n1\n!\n+\n2\n!\n+\n3\n!\n+\n.\n.\n.\n+\n(\nn\nâ\n1\n)\n!\n!n = 0! + 1! + 2! + 3! + ... + (n - 1)!\n!\nn\n=\n0\n!\n+\n1\n!\n+\n2\n!\n+\n3\n!\n+\n.\n.\n.\n+\n(\nn\nâ\n1\n)\n!\n.\nKurepa conjectured that the greatest common divisor of\n!\nn\n!n\n!\nn\nand\nn\n!\nn!\nn\n!\nwas\n2\nfor all\nn\n>\n1\nn > 1\nn\n>\n1\n. There are many equivalent forms of the conjecture, but one of the most natural was given by Kurepa in the same\n1971\npaper, namely that\n!\nn\n!n\n!\nn\nis not divisible by\nn\nn\nn\nfor any\nn\n>\n2\nn > 2\nn\n>\n2\n. If the left factorial conjecture is false we certainly know that it will only fail for some\nn\n>\n1000000\nn > 1000000\nn\n>\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n.\nKurepa played a major role in mathematics in Yugoslavia. He was chairman of the Mathematical Institute of the\nSerbian Academy of Sciences\nfrom\n1970\nto\n1980\n. He founded the Society of Mathematicians and Physicists of Croatia and became its president. He was also president of the Union of Yugoslav Societies of Mathematicians, Physicists and Astronomers, and of the Balkan Mathematical Society."
