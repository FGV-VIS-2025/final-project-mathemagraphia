  "biografia": "Robert Dunbar\n's father was  Thomas S Dunbar\n(\nborn Pitsligo, Aberdeenshire about\n1852)\nwho was a merchant tailor. His mother was  Elizabeth Dunbar\n(\nborn in Old Cumnock, Ayrshire about\n1855)\n. Robert  Dunbar had eight older siblings: Isabella\n(\nborn about\n1876)\n, Elizabeth\n(\nborn about\n1877)\n, John\n(\nborn about\n1879)\n, Marguerite\n(\nborn about\n1881)\n, Mary\n(\nborn about\n1883)\n, James\n(\nborn about\n1885)\n, Thomas\n(\nborn about\n1886)\nand William\n(\nborn about\n1887)\n.\nRobert Dunbar entered the Eastern School, Broughty Ferry when he was five years old, moving to the Western School, Broughty Ferry after a year. After three years at this school e attended Grove Academy in Broughty Ferry, where he spent two years, then Harris Academy in Dundee where he spent seven years, the final two being at Central Classes, Harris Academy, Dundee.\nHe sat examinations in the Scottish Leaving Certificate in\n1905\nand\n1906\nand was awarded Higher passes in English, Mathematics, Latin, and Greek, with Lower passes in Dynamics, and French. He was awarded a bursary in\n1907\nto go to Edinburgh University. He first matriculated in\n1907\nand his course of study included Latin, Greek, Mathematics, Natural Philosophy, Intermediate Honours Mathematics, Thermodynamics, Intermediate Physics, Advanced Natural Philosophy, Advanced Mathematics, and Function Theory. In June\n1915\nhe was awarded an M.A. with First Class Honours in Mathematics and Natural Philosophy. He was also awarded a B.Sc.\n(\nPure\n)\nin the same year. Also in June\n1915\nhe was awarded a Maclaren Mathematical Scholarship.\nThe dates above indicate that something is missing. Dunbar appears to have taken eight years from first matriculation to the award of his degree and this seems puzzling. The records at the University of Edinburgh show a gap between\n1910\nand\n1914\nwhen he took no courses. The only additional facts we can add to those given above are that Dunbar was awarded the Robert Wilson Memorial Prize for Chemistry from Edinburgh University for session\n1910\nand that he was runner-up for the Mackay-Smith scholarship in Natural Philosophy in\n1910\n.\nBy the time Dunbar graduated in\n1915\n, World War I was in progress. On\n16\nAugust\n1915\nDunbar received his Commission Documents sent to Captain Robert Taylor Dunbar, Royal Garrison Artillery. At the end of the war Dunbar returned to Edinburgh University. He was appointed Assistant in Natural Philosophy in\n1919\nand worked for his doctorate supervised by\nCharles Glover Barkla\n. In\n1921\nhe became a Lecturer in Natural Philosophy. In the same year he married Margaret Pirie White.\nMargaret White was born in Edinburgh in\n1892\n. She attended Torphican Public School from\n1899\nto\n1903\n, James Gillespie's School from\n1903\nto\n1904\n, then George Watson's Ladies' College from\n1904\nto\n1911\n. She then attended Edinburgh University where she graduated M.A. with first class honours in mathematics and natural philosophy in June\n1915\n. She was an assistant in natural philosophy at Edinburgh University from\n1916\nto\n1920\nand she was appointed lecturer in\n1920\n. In the following year she resigned in order to marry Robert Dunbar. She published the paper\nAbsorption and scattering of X-rays and the characteristic radiations of the J series\nin collaboration with\nCharles Glover Barkla\n. It appeared in the\nPhilosophical Magazine\n(\nOctober\n1917)\n.\nRobert Dunbar was awarded his doctorate in\n1924\n. His wife was also awarded a doctorate. Dunbar left Edinburgh in\n1924\nto take up the position of Senior Lecturer in Physics at University College Cardiff. He was also Director of the Viriamu Jones Physics Research Laboratory at Cardiff. In\n1930\nhe was promoted to Professor of Physics at University College, Cardiff, a position he held for the rest of his career.\nThe obituary of\nCharles Glover Barkla\nin the Royal Society in\n1947\ngives technical details of Robert Dunbar's contributions:-\nThe bearing of Compton's theory on the J-phenomena was investigated by R T Dunbar, an Edinburgh graduate who worked for several years in\nBarkla\n's laboratory and was afterwards appointed professor of physics in University College, Cardiff. In his first paper, communicated by\nProfessor Barkla\nto the Philosophical Magazine\n(\nDunbar,\n1925)\n, experiments extending over a period of years were described. The source of X-rays was a Coolidge tube of the 'broad-focus' type with tungsten anticathode. The source of high-tension current was a\n16\n-inch coil operated by a mercury break, the primary current being obtained from the City supply at\n230\nvolts. Under the conditions of these experiments the J-discontinuities did not appear or were not certainly indicated in absorption, ionization or corpuscular emission, and in general the observations were in agreement with the Compton theory. A second more elaborate investigation was carried out by Dunbar\n(1928)\nin the Viriamu Jones Laboratory, Cardiff, and published in an important paper in May\n1928\n. Again the J-discontinuities in the absorption of scattered X-radiation\n(\nheterogeneous\n)\nwere not observed.\nDespite his research contributions, when Dunbar became head of department in Cardiff he made it known that he believed that universities should concentrate on teaching and that research was best done in special research institutes such as the National Physical Laboratory in the UK or the\nMax Planck\nInstitutes in Germany.\nRobert Dunbar joined the\nEdinburgh Mathematical Society\nin December\n1914\nwhile still an undergraduate in Edinburgh. He served on the Committee of the Society in\n1923\n. Margaret P White joined the\nEdinburgh Mathematical Society\nin February\n1917\nwhile an Assistant in Natural Philosophy at Edinburgh University. She left the Society in\n1921\nwhen she married, but her husband continued as a member of the Society throughout his career."
