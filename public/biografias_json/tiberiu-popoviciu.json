  "biografia": "Tiberiu Popoviciu\nwas born in Arad which, at the time of his birth was in the autonomous region of Transylvania in Austro-Hungary. This remained the case until the end of World War I when, following the Treaty of Trianon, it became part of Romania. He attended primary school in Arad, moving on to the high school in Arad which is now the National College \"Moise Nicoara\". This school was founded in\n1873\nwhen Arad was part of Austro-Hungary and only received the name \"Moise Nicoara\" in\n1919\nwhen Transylvania became part of Romania.  He showed remarkable ability in mathematics at this high school, and in\n1923\nhe became the editor of\nJurnal Matematic\n, the school mathematical journal, a task he continued with for two years. The\nGazeta Matematica\n(\nthe Mathematical Gazette\n)\nran annual mathematics contests and, in\n1924\n, Popoviciu won the national Rumania-wide contest. In the same year, he graduated from the high school and entered the Faculty of Sciences at the University of Bucharest.\nPopoviciu attended a variety of courses in the Faculty of Sciences at the University of Bucharest, specialising in mathematics. His professors were some famous mathematicians of that time, such as: David Emmanuel,\nGheorghe ÈiÈeica\n,\nDimitrie Pompeiu\n, and Anton Davidoglu. He graduated from the University of Bucharest in\n1927\nand, despite having to compete against strong competition, he was admitted to the Ãcole Normale Superieure in Paris later that year. Between\n1927\nand\n1930\n, as well as courses at the Ãcole Normale Superieure, he also attended mathematics courses at the Sorbonne. During his time in Paris, he attended courses given by world-leading mathematicians such as:\nÃmile Picard\n,\nEdouard Goursat\n,\nJacques Hadamard\n,\nElie Cartan\n,\nPaul Montel\n,\nErnest Vessiot\n,\nGaston Julia\n, and\nJean Chazy\n.\nIn October\n1928\nPopoviciu was awarded his bachelor's degree in Mathematics and then began research for his Ph.D. thesis under the guidance of\nPaul Montel\n. On\n12\nJune\n1933\nTiberiu Popoviciu defended, with great distinction, his Ph.D. thesis\nSur quelques propriÃ©tes des fonctions d'une ou de deux variables rÃ©elles\nâ\n(\nOn some properties of functions of one or two real variables\n)\n. In this thesis he generalised the notion of convex functions, defining the convex functions of higher order. Over the following years, he published his thesis and a series of papers on this topic beginning with\nSur le prolongement des fonctions convexes d'ordre supÃ©rieur\nâ\n(\nOn the extension of convex higher-order functions\n)\n(1934)\n,\nSur l'approximation des fonctions convexes d'ordre supÃ©rieur\nâ\n(\nOn the approximation of convex functions of higher order\n)\n(1934)\nand\nNotes sur les fontions convexes d'ordre supÃ©rieur\nâ\n(\nNotes on convex functions of higher order\n)\n(1936)\n. We give more information on this important research below.\nAfter his return to Romania in\n1933\n, Popoviciu began his university activities at Cluj where he was appointed first as librarian and then, after a year, as assistant lecturer in the Faculty of Sciences. From\n1934\nto\n1936\nhe was an assistant to the professor of Algebra,\nTheodor AngheluÈÄ\n. On\n1\nApril\n1936\nhe left Cluj when he was appointed as a lecturer in the Faculty of Sciences at CernÄuÈi. This university had been founded in\n1875\nwhen this region was part of Austro-Hungary but it became Romanian in\n1918\nand new buildings had been built by the Romanian government. Originally teaching had been in German but, when Popoviciu taught there, the language of instruction was Romanian. On\n4\nJune\n1937\nhe was elected as a corresponding member of the\nRomanian Academy of Sciences\n. However, in\n1940\n, during World War II, CernÄuÈi and the surrounding area was captured by the Soviet troops and it became part of Ukraine. The language of instruction became Ukrainian. At this time Popoviciu left CernÄuÈi and he was appointed as an assistant professor of Mathematical Analysis at the University of Bucharest. He held this position from\n1940\nto\n1942\nwhen he was appointed as Professor of Function Theory at the University of IaÈi. This university was founded in\n1860\nand today is known as the Alexandru Ioan Cuza University.\nIn\n1946\nPopoviciu returned to Cluj where he was appointed professor in the Chair of Algebra and Number Theory. At this time there were two universities in Cluj, the Romanian University of Cluj which had been the King Ferdinand I University, was renamed BabeÈ University\n(\nafter the Romanian natural scientist Victor BabeÈ\n)\nwhile the Hungarian University of Cluj was named the Bolyai University\n(\nafter the mathematician\nJÃ¡nos Bolyai\n)\n. The two universities combined to become the BabeÈ Bolyai University in\n1959\n. After two years in the Chair of Algebra and Number Theory, Popoviciu was appointed to the Chair of Mathematical Analysis in\n1948\n. He became the head of this department and, in the same year, was elected as a corresponding member of the\nRomanian Academy of Sciences\n.\nPopoviciu made important contributions in Mathematical Analysis, Approximation Theory, Convexity, Numerical Analysis, Functional Equations, Algebra and Number Theory. One of his most important scientific contributions, mentioned above, is the concept of convex functions of higher order\n(\nas a generalization of the notion of convex function\n)\ngiven in his Ph.D. thesis and then published in\nMathematica\nin\n1934\n. Most of the results concerning the theory of convex functions of higher order are contained in his famous book\nLes fonctions convexes\nâ\n(\nConvex functions\n)\n, Actualites Scientifique et Industrielles, Paris,\n1944\n. Edwin F Beckenbach\n(1906\n-\n1982)\nwrites in a review:-\nIn the first chapter the author develops fundamental properties of functions of order\nn\nn\nn\n, in the second he continues the study of functions of order\nn\nn\nn\nand considers various inequalities, in the third he examines several generalizations of functions of order\nn\nn\nn\n, while he devotes the fourth and last chapter to the discussion of functions of two or more variables. Proofs are omitted deliberately, and very few applications are made.\nThe importance of Popoviciu's work is stressed in\n[\n13\n]\nwhere the author indicates that with this work, begun in his thesis and continued in many papers and the book\nLes fonctions convexes\nâ\n(\nConvex functions\n)\n:-\n... he laid the foundations of a new chapter in modern mathematics. The road Tiberiu Popoviciu opened in the Constructive Theory of Functions and Functional Analysis allowed the establishment of linear functionals that intervene in the expression of the remainder in approximation operations. Obviously, all the results referring to the evaluation of the approximation order by positive and linear operators are included here, as are the convergence criteria for sequences of such operators, the study of remainders in linear methods of approximation, the comparative theory of different ways of organising computations in interpolation, the criteria whose certain satisfaction engenders representations of special forms, and many other results. Why is it important to highlight all these things? Because Tiberiu Popoviciu's very outlook on Computation Practice transformed what was referred as Numerical Calculation before into a new discipline, Numerical Analysis, in the modern sense of this concept. This point of view was understood and assumed by Tiberiu Popoviciu's students and underlies the foundation of what is now known as the Romanian School of Numerical Analysis and Approximation Theory.\nTiberiu Popoviciu is the founder of the Cluj School of Numerical Analysis. His work on this topic began in\n1938\nwith the paper\nSur les solutions bornÃ©es et les solutions mesurables de certaines Ã©cuations fontionnelles\nâ\n(\nOn bounded solutions and measurable solutions to some functional equations\n)\n. It was, however, only in the early\n1950\ns that he began to publish a whole series of important papers on the topic. Because of his efforts, in\n1957\nthe Institute for Scientific Computing was founded in Cluj.\nElena Popoviciu\nwrites\n[\n5\n]\n:-\nIn\n1957\n, Tiberiu Popoviciu founded the first Institute for Scientific Computing, with a multi-disciplinary structure, in south-eastern Europe. The Institute of Numerical Analysis in Cluj, part of the\nRomanian Academy of Sciences\n, succeeded in gathering around it a group of gifted mathematicians, under the guidance of Tiberiu Popoviciu. The department of computing machines of the Institute brought together a multi-disciplinary team\n(\nmathematicians, economist, physicist engineers\n)\nwith the aim of building some very advanced computers.\nPopoviciu was the director of this Institute which, in\n1961\n, produced one of the first Romanian computers DACICC-\n1\n(\nDispozitiv Automat de Calcul al Institutului de Calcul din Cluj\n)\n. Then, in\n1969\n, also in Cluj, they produced DACICC-\n200\n- one of the best performing Romanian computers of the Sixties. Florian Potra said in the interview\n[\n4\n]\n:-\nStudents in the special mathematics high school class had access to the Institute for Scientific Computing\n(\nInstitutul de Calcul\n)\nof the\nRomanian Academy of Sciences\n. They had their own computers, built there, and we learned to do some machine language programming. That was in the\n1960\ns, and it was interesting. I kept up a long relationship with the director of that institute, the Academician Tiberiu Popoviciu. He was about\n60\nwhen I met him as a high school student. Later he was my Master's thesis advisor. Because of my admiration for Tiberiu Popoviciu, I combined some good classical analysis with some numerical analysis, and a little bit of\nfunctional analysis\n...\nIn\n1964\nPopoviciu married the mathematician\nElena Moldovan\n, the daughter of Ioan Moldovan and of his wife Rozalia.\nElena Popoviciu\n, who has a biography in this archive, is the author of\n[\n5\n]\n,\n[\n6\n]\n,\n[\n7\n]\n,\n[\n8\n]\n, and\n[\n9\n]\n.\nSome other achievements of Tiberiu Popoviciu were: the reactivation, in\n1958\n, of the journal\nMathematica\n(\nCluj\n)\n, the founding, in\n1972\n, of the journal\nRevue d'Analyse Numerique et de Theorie de l'Approximation\n, and the opening, in\n1967\n, of a research seminar: 'The Itinerant Seminar on Functional Equations', later renamed as 'The Itinerant Seminar on Functional Equations, Approximation and Convexity'. Tiberiu Popoviciu was, in November\n1948\n, elected a corresponding member and from\n20\nMarch\n1963\na full member of the\nRomanian Academy\n. He was also for more than\n30\nyears the president of the Cluj branch of the\nRomanian Mathematical Society\n.\nPopoviciu published\nNumerical Analysis. Introductory notions of approximate calculation\n(\nRomanian\n)\nin\n1975\n. It was the first book in an intended series on Computing Theory, Numerical Analysis and Information Theory. A review of the book states:-\nThis is planned to be the first volume in a series on numerical analysis. It is introductory, elementary and very thorough: the material covered is confined to the study of decimal representations of real numbers, approximations to real numbers, error bounds in general, the approximate execution of the fundamental operations, and the numerical calculation of the\nLagrange\ninterpolating polynomial.\nHowever, his early death meant that he was unable to complete his intended task. He was a very active, creative and prolific mathematician until his unexpected death in\n1975\n, after just half year from the moment of the abolition of his Institute of Scientific Computing by the Communist regime. After his death, the Institute of Scientific Computing was transferred from the\nRomanian Academy\nto the National Education Minister and the number of researchers was reduced from\n48\nto\n6\n.\nWe note that the Tiberiu Popoviciu High School of Computer Science was founded in\n1971\nand named for Popoviciu as the founder of computer science in Romania. The Institute for Scientific Computing of the\nRomanian Academy\nis now named the \"Tiberiu Popoviciu\" Institute for Scientific Computing.\nLet us end this biography by giving a quote by Tiberiu Popoviciu:-\nAlgebra is a science of the equalities while Analysis is one of the inequalities."
