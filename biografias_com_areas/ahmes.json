  "biografia": "Ahmes\nis the scribe who wrote the Rhind Papyrus\n(\nnamed after the Scottish Egyptologist Alexander Henry Rhind who went to Thebes for health reasons, became interested in excavating and purchased the papyrus in Egypt in\n1858)\n.\nAhmes claims not to be the author of the work, being, he claims, only a scribe. He says that the material comes from an earlier work of about\n2000\nBC.\nThe papyrus is our chief source of information on Egyptian mathematics. The Recto contains division of\n2\nby the odd numbers\n3\nto\n101\nin unit fractions and the numbers\n1\nto\n9\nby\n10\n. The Verso has\n87\nproblems on the four operations, solution of equations, progressions, volumes of granaries, the two-thirds rule etc.\nThe Rhind Papyrus, which came to the British Museum in\n1863\n, is sometimes called the 'Ahmes papyrus' in honour of Ahmes. Nothing is known of Ahmes other than his own comments in the papyrus.\nThe Rhind papyrus",
