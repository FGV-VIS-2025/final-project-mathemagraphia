  "biografia": "Ugo Amaldi\n's parents were Edoardo Amaldi and Emilia Vettori. Edoardo was an Austrian magistrate who was near Padua when the Second Italian War of Independence broke out in\n1859\n. This war involved Piedmont, who were supported by the French, fighting against the Austrians who controlled the region. After the defeat of Austrian forces the war ended with Piedmont supported by France in control of much of northern Italy. Edoardo was appointed by Piedmont as a magistrate in Como. He served as a magistrate in several different cities over the following years, mostly in Pavia before ending his career as Attorney General in Bologna. He married Emilia Vettori who came from a family who strongly supported the partisans. One of her brothers had supported Giuseppe Garibaldi during the failed insurrection of\n1834\nand followed Garibaldi into exile in South America. Ugo was the youngest of his parents' three children, having two older brothers, Italo\n(1864\n-\n1940)\nwho became an assistant to\nFelice Casorati\nand\nErnesto Pascal\nat Pavia before becoming a professor at various technical institutes, and Paolo\n(1865\n-\n1956)\nwho became a medical doctor and the first director of the Neuropsychiatric hospital in Mendrisio in\n1898\n.\nIt was in Pavia that Amaldi completed his secondary school studies at the high school \"Ugo Foscolo\".\nFelice Casorati\nhad been a pupil at this school forty years before Amaldi. At this school Amaldi was taught mathematics by Luigi Berzotari who was both an excellent mathematician and teacher. Berzotari had published\nSulla superficie del quarte ordine avente una conica doppia\nâ\n(\nOn the surface of the fourth order with a double cone\n)\nin the\nAnnali di Matematica Pura ed Applicata\nin\n1885\n. After graduating from the high school in\n1894\n, Amaldi entered the University of Bologna in\n1894\nwhere he was taught by\nCesare ArzelÃ\n, who held the chair of Infinitesimal Calculus, and\nSalvatore Pincherle\nwho held the chair of Algebraic Analysis and Analytic Geometry. He was also taught by\nFederigo Enriques\nwho was only four years his senior. Amaldi always considered himself a student of\nPincherle\n, but regarded\nEnriques\nas his second master and the two later collaborated.\nWhen he had began his undergraduate studies Amaldi was undecided whether to specialise in engineering or in mathematics. However, although he enjoyed both practical and theoretical courses, it was\nEnriques\n' course on projective geometry that really inspired him. In his second year\n(1895\n-\n96)\nhe took courses by\nPincherle\non group theory where he met both discrete groups and continuous groups. In his third year he attended\nEnriques\n' seminar on higher geometry, where he became interested in non-euclidean geometry. On\n28\nNovember\n1898\nAmaldi graduated after submitting a thesis on the\nLaplace\ntransform entitled\nLa trasformazione di Laplace e le equazioni differenziali lineari, a coefficienti razionali, di rango\n1\nâ\n(\nLaplace transformations and nonlinear differential equations, with rational coefficients, of rank\n1\n)\n. After graduating he passed the examinations to qualify as a secondary school teacher.\nWhile collaborating with\nPincherle\non writing a treatise, Amaldi published\nSulla trasformazione di Laplace\nâ\n(\nOn the transformation of Laplace\n)\n(1898)\nand\nSulle sostituzioni lineari commutabili\nâ\n(\nOn commutable linear substitutions\n)\n. His\n490\n-page treatise, co-authored with\nPincherle\n, was entitled\nLe operazioni distributive e le loro applicazioni all'analisi\nâ\n(\nThe distribution operations and their applications to analysis\n)\nand it was published in\n1901\n. After this publication Amaldi published a remarkable number of papers:\nContributo alla determinazione dei gruppi continui finiti dello spazio ordinario\nâ\n(\nContribution to the determination of finite continuous groups of ordinary space\n)\nand\nLe superficie con infinite trasformazioni conformi in sÃ¨ stesse\nâ\n(\nThe surface with infinite conformal transformations of itself\n)\nappeared in\n1901\n, then five more papers in\n1902\nas well as a\n655\n-page textbook\nElementi di geometria ad uso delle scuole secondarie superiori\nâ\n(\nElements of geometry for use by secondary schools\n)\nco-authored with\nEnriques\n.\nIn\n1902\nhe became an assistant lecturer in Complementary Algebra and Analytical Geometry at the University of Bologna. On\n3\nSeptember of that year a national competition was announced for a chair of Algebra and Analytical Geometry at the University of Cagliari with a deadline for applications on\n6\nOctober\n1902\n. He won the competition and taught at the University of Cagliari for two years beginning in\n1903\n. In February\n1903\nhe married Luisa Basini whom he had known for many years. They had three children, Adalgisa\n(\nknown as Gisina\n)\n, Mercedes and Edoardo. Gisina married the magistrate Vittorio Olivieri Sangiacomo and had two sons: Giorgio and Corrado. Mercedes married the engineer Lodovico Marchesi and had five children: Maria Luisa, Camillo, Ugo, Giovanna, and Ludovica. Edoardo\n(1908\n-\n1989)\nstudied under\nEnrico Fermi\nand became a leading physicist. He married Ginestra Giovene and had four children: Ugo, Paola, Francesco and Daniela.\nAmaldi transferred to Modena in\n1906\n, where he was appointed a professor in Analytical and Projective Geometry, then in\n1919\nhe moved to Padua where he was a professor of Descriptive Geometry with Applications until\n1922\n. Remaining in Padua, he was appointed to the chair of Analytical Geometry in\n1922\n, a position he held for two years. Finally in\n1924\nhe moved to Rome where he was a professor of Mathematical Analysis and Analytic Geometry in the Faculty of Architecture until\n1942\nwhen he became professor of Algebraic and Infinitesimal Mathematical Analysis in the Faculty of Science for the rest of his career. He retired at the age of\n75\nin\n1950\n.\nThe greatest of Amaldi's research contributions is his classification of infinite dimensional\nLie groups\nacting on three-dimensional space. Amaldi had attended a course by\nPincherle\non\nLie\ngroups which he found fascinating and he was also fascinated by\nPincherle\n's theory of functionals. Advised by\nPincherle\n, Amaldi decided to apply the theory of functionals to deal with infinite dimensional\nLie\ngroups. Over the next years he worked on the problem, read thoroughly the work of\nÃlie Cartan\non the subject, and corresponded with\nCartan\n. He produced important results on infinite dimensional\nLie\ngroups acting on\n3\n-dimensional space as Enrico Rogora explains in\n[\n7\n]\n:-\n[\nAmaldi\n]\ncompleted the classification of punctual and contact transformation groups acting in three dimensional space, both finite and infinite dimensional.\nThese are impressive results, but somehow Amaldi's achievement seems to have gained surprisingly little attention. Enrico Rogora tries to explain why this happened\n[\n7\n]\n:-\nPart of the responsibility for the oblivion of Amaldi's work is due to Amaldi himself. At a certain point of his career he decided to accept a position at the \"School of Architecture\" in Rome, which, contrary to his expectations, never became a university institution. Hence he had been out of the mainstream of Italian mathematical research for years. Amaldi also realized the loss of centrality of the classification problem for the mathematics of his period, due to the necessity to put\nLie\n's theory of transformation groups on firmer basis and he always considered his work with excessive modesty, as is shown, for example, in the excerpt of the following letter\n[\nwritten in June\n1918]\nto\nLevi-Civita\n, where he thanks his friend for his considerations on his most important work. \"I heartfully thank you for your kind words about my huge memoir. By experience I perfectly know that l need to soften your judgments about my work because of your great benevolence toward myself. Even so, I have greatly appreciated your good words, since now that I am in front of this huge volume, I feel concerned, especially with respect to the Society XL, by the responsibility to publish such a work for which I have honestly to admit the imbalance between size and interest. After the half commitment I look in a previous work, it was a kind of point of honour for me to complete this classification: in any case, this work is the end of my researches on the classification of continuous groups, on which I have already insisted too much.\"\nA very personal account of Ugo Amaldi's personality is given by Tullio Viola, who was his colleague for many years, in\n[\n8\n]\n. We present an English translation by Fiona Spencer\n(\na University of St Andrews student\n)\nof Viola's obituary of Amaldi at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nPerhaps Amaldi's name is remembered more today for his textbooks written with\nFederigo Enriques\n. We mentioned above their textbook\nElementi di geometria ad uso delle scuole secondarie superiori\nâ\n(\nElements of geometry for use by secondary schools\n)\n, published in\n1903\n, which was aimed at the teaching of geometry in secondary schools. This was the first of a series of textbooks written by Amaldi and\nEnriques\nfor use in secondary schools. We list some of these books:\nNozioni di geometria ad uso dei ginnasi inferiori\nâ\n(\nGeometric concepts for the use of lower secondary schools\n)\n(1910)\n;\nNozioni di matematica ad uso dei lici moderni\nâ\n(\nMathematical concepts for the use of modern high schools\n)\n(2\nvolumes,\n1914\n-\n15)\n; and\nGeometria elementare per le scuole secondarie superiori\nâ\n(\nElementary geometry for high schools\n)\n(2\nvolumes,\n1925\n-\n26)\n. Problems with these books occurred in\n1938\nwhen the Italian Fascist government passed a law which:-\n... prohibited the adoption of textbooks by authors of the Jewish race. The ban also extends to books that are the result of the collaboration of several authors, one of whom is of the Jewish race; and works that have been commented on or reviewed by people of Jewish race.\nIt is hard to believe that many textbooks would be available for use in Italian schools after this remarkably all-embracing law. Amaldi was not Jewish, but his co-author\nEnriques\nwas Jewish and was forced to resign from his teaching position in\n1938\n. The law, drafted by the Minister of National Education Giuseppe Bottai, meant that the jointly authored Amaldi-\nEnriques\nbooks could no longer be used in schools. In an attempt to allow these books to be able to continue being used in schools, editions were published with only Amaldi's name as author. However, the Ministry of National Education quickly spotted that an attempt was being made to have a textbook, written in part by a Jew, still available in schools and warnings were issued to the publisher. After the Italian Fascist government fell in\n1944\n, editions of the books were published with the two authors.\nAnother very important work which we should mention was\nLezioni di meccanica razionale\nâ\n(\nLessons in rational mechanics\n)\nwhich Amaldi wrote in collaboration with\nTullio Levi-Civita\n. A hand-written version of part of their text was published in\n1920\nand the book was printed in two volumes, the first being published in\n1923\n. The authors wrote in the Preface to this volume:-\nThe work of which we present the first volume, has come about through the teaching of rational mechanics, which one of us has professed for over twenty years in Padua and Rome, the other for six years in Modena and Padua. Originally derived from teaching, the work has a specific elementary character, so it cannot, nor does it pretend to be, a real treatise. However, we dare to hope that it will also be welcomed as a reference book, because we, while carrying out our institutional discussion, have consistently and thoughtfully considered the various and diverse needs of those who study the rational mechanics, according to the needs of mathematicians or physicists or astronomers or surveyors, or, on the other hand, technicians, or mechanical manufacturers, or civil engineers, or naval engineers, or hydraulic engineers or industrial engineers or electrical engineers.\nThe second volume appeared in two parts, the first in\n1926\nand the second in the following year.\nAmaldi died after much suffering with an incurable illness.
