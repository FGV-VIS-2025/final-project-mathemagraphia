  "biografia": "Henry Perigal Jr\nwas the son of Henry Perigal Sr\n(1768\n-\n1867)\nand Louisa Brady\n(1770\n-\n1827)\n. Henry Perigal Sr, born at Norton Folgate, Spitalfields, London on\n19\nJuly\n1768\n, married Louisa Brady, born\n17\nNovember\n1770\nat Alverstroke, Southampton County, at Arundel Church, Sussex, England on\n2\nNovember\n1799\n. Henry Perigal Jr, the subject of this biography, was the first of his parents' six children having the siblings Louisa Perigal\n(1802\n-\n1805)\n, Caroline Perigal\n(1804\n-\n1888)\n, George Perigal\n(1806\n-\n1855)\n, who became a well-known chess player and Honorary Secretary to the London Chess Club, Louisa Ann Perigal\n(1808\n-\n1876)\n, and Frederick Perigal\n(1812\n-\n1905)\n, who spent forty years in the Admiralty. Henry Perigal Sn became Assistant Secretary to the Victualling Board working in the Admiralty Office. He lived to the age of\n99\n, being one of thirteen children, nine of whom\n[\n2\n]\n:-\n... attained respectively their\n64\nth\n,\n67\nth\n,\n77\nth\n,\n80\nth\n,\n88\nth\n,\n90\nth\n,\n94\nth\n,\n97\nth\n, and\n100\nth\nyear - the last five averaging\n93\nyears\n100\ndays.\nWe have to remember that, although this does not seem remarkable by today's average life span, in\n1800\nthe average life span in the UK was only\n40\nyears.\nLouisa Brady was the daughter of Lieutenant James Brady, R.N., and Ann Farrington.\nThe family's ancestry went back to\n[\n4\n]\n:-\n... Sigurd the Dane, who in\n908\nmade a successful raid on Normandy, assumed the name of Perigal, and settled in France. The English branch of the family sprang from Gideon Perigal and his wife, Madeline Duval of Dieppe, Huguenots who escaped to London. Henry Perigal belongs to the tenth generation of their descendants.\nThe family background is described in detail in the work\n[\n10\n]\nby Frederick Perigal, the youngest of the siblings.\nHenry Perigal was\n67\nyears old when his father, also named Henry Perigal, died so for most of his adult life he was known as 'Henry Perigal Junior', while his father was 'Henry Perigal Senior'. Henry Perigal Sr was friendly with John Holt Ibbetson, who was an inventor who published works such as\nSpecimens of Eccentric Circular Turning, with Practical Illustrations for producing Corresponding Pieces in that Art\n(1817)\nand A\nBrief Account of Ibbetson's Geometric Chuck, manufactured by Holtzapffel & Co., with a selection of\n32\nSpecimens, illustrative of some of its powers\n(1833)\n. This was friendship which became important for Perigal, the subject of this biography, as we shall see below.\nPerigal, who was known by the nickname \"Cyclops\"\n(\nin fact Cyclops, in brackets, is carved on his tomb\n)\n, seems to have had a variety of jobs over the first forty years of his life but the main one was as a clerk in the Privy Council Office. From the\n1840\ns he worked as a bookkeeper for his friend Henry Tudor who was a stockbroker operating from an office at\n29\nThreadneedle Street, London. Perigal continued working for Henry Tudor & Son, Stockbrokers, and only retired from the firm when he was\n87\nyears old. He never married and we see from the UK census the different families that he lived with as a visitor or lodger. In both the\n1841\nand\n1851\ncensus he was living as a visitor with the Green family, a widow Sarah Green living with a daughter, two sons and a servant, at\n5\nSmith Street, Chelsea, London. He is living that this address in\n1843\nand writes a paper from it in August\n1849\n. In February\n1853\nhe gives his address on a paper as Cheyne Walk, Chelsea. An article written in\n1856\ngives his address as\n26\nBrompton Square, London, but at the time of the\n1861\nUK Census he is described as a visitor living with the large Fulkan family, the head of the family being Hamilton Fulkan, a civil engineer. The family had a nurse, a cook, two housemaids and a groom. On a paper Perigal wrote in\n1869\nhe gives the address\n57\nWarren Street, Fitzroy Square. At the time of the\n1871\nUK Census, he was living as a lodger with artists and painters, Paul Ganci, his wife and two nieces, at\n9\nNorth Crescent, Bedford Square. He continued living there, this being his address up to the time of his death in\n1898\n.\nFrom the time he was young, Perigal was interested in curve tracing using Ibbetson's geometric chuck, a tool used in ornamental wood turning. The obituary in\nLeonard J Rogers\n' article\n[\n12\n]\nstates:-\nTo this subject he brought to bear great patience, perseverance, and delicacy of manipulation. Many of the curves so drawn by him between\n1830\nand\n1840\nare exquisite examples of fine geometrical tracings performed by means of the bow pen.\nFor the whole of the obituary of Perigal in\nLeonard Rogers\n' article, see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nIn\n1843\nAugustus De Morgan\npublished the article\nTrochoidal curve\nin the\nPenny Cyclopaedia\n. He ends this article as follows:-\n... we wish to call attention to the fact that the specimens of curves in this article are all the product of machinery. We are indebted for them to the kindness of Mr Henry Perigal, of Smith Street, Chelsea, a gentleman whose pursuits are scientific, and who practices the higher branches of turning as an amateur, and has devoted much time and money to the investigation of the  effects of combined motions, as shown in the curves, resulting from them. Most of those given in this article were executed in his lathe by means of Ibbetson's geometric chuck, a contrivance the results of which are well known to turners, but which have never been exhibited, as far as we know, in any article professing to give a mathematical classification of them.\nPerigal's geometric chuck can be seen at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nBefore looking in more detail at Perigal's ideas and inventions, we should make it clear that although he did some nice geometric work, most of his ideas relating to astronomy were incorrect. The reader might well ask: \"Why is he being included in this archive if many of his ideas were incorrect?\" Perigal was an eccentric man but also clever. Although many of his ideas were incorrect, they were well thought out and made those with the correct ideas justify what they believed in. Many leading mathematicians and astronomers were his friends, made use of his skills, and were happy to see him raise issues which led to vigorous discussions, many in print. His friends included\nGeorge Biddell Airy\n, William Henry Mahoney Christie\n(1845\n-\n1922)\n(\nan Astronomer Royal\n)\n,\nLord Kelvin\n,\nLord Rayleigh\n,\nGeorge Gabriel Stokes\n, Silvanus Phillips Thompson\n(1851\n-\n1916)\n,\nJames Whitbread Lee Glaisher\nand\nJames Joseph Sylvester\n.\nHe did some nice work on proving classical geometry theorems which only reached a wider audience after\nJames Glaisher\nsuggested he contribute some short papers to the\nMessenger of Mathematics\nin\n1872\n. In the first of these papers Perigal writes\n[\n9\n]\n:-\nThe present series of papers consist chiefly of notes and diagrams extracted from my note-books and sketches made during the last forty years. I have devoted much time and thought to the solution of geometric theorems and problems by dissections and transpositions, viz. in proving the equality of areas in equivalent rectangles, &c., and investigating how the figures could be best dissected, so that their component parts might be fitted together in either form, and I have often contemplated proving all the suitable Theorems and Problems in\nEuclid\nby such dissections and transpositions, so as to render them self-evident by ocular demonstration.\nThe article\n[\n8\n]\ncontains Perigal's symmetrical dissection approach to\nPythagoras\n' Theorem for which he is best known today. He was so proud of it that the diagram was engraved on his tombstone. You can read a version of the article at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nSpencer Compton, the\n2\nnd Marquess of Northampton\n(1790\n-\n1851)\n, was a well-known patron of the arts and sciences. He served as president of the Geological Society of London in the\n1920\ns and as president of the Archaeological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland\n(1845\n-\n46\nand\n1850\n-\n51)\n. In\n1838\nhe became president of the\nRoyal Society of London\n, continuing to serve in this role for ten years. Perigal was a regular at Saturday evening soirÃ©es of the Marquess of Northampton, and he exhibited various instruments at these events. Several were reported in the\nLiterary Gazette\nwhere quite full descriptions of Perigold's ideas are given; we learn that his exhibits attracted the most attention. On the soirÃ©e of\n21\nMarch\n1846\n, Perigal exhibited an instrument:-\n... generating retrogressive or recurrent curves, by which the moving body, when it has reached the extreme points of the curve, retrogrades or returns back in exactly the same line along which it advanced; constantly moving forward and backward from one extremity to the other; and always tracing and retracing the same line as it alternately advances and recedes.\nHe showed parabola-like curves which formed figure-of-eight figures and suggested that comets, following orbits computed to be parabolas, may follow such closed orbits. In the next soiree on\n7\nApril\n1846\nhe exhibited another instrument which produced parabola-like curves but, unlike the one from the pervious session, they did not cross over their paths but had a single closed loop. Again he suggested a possible comet connection. On the Marquess of Northampton's soirÃ©e of\n13\nFebruary\n1847\nhe presented his theory that the Moon did not rotate and illustrated his theory with instruments. This soirÃ©e was described in the\nIllustrated London News\nof\n20\nFebruary\n1847\nwhere it states:-\nThe evening event was held at the Marquis of Northampton's London home on The Terrace, Piccadilly. The location of the conversazione is described in contemporary accounts: 'The suite of saloons is four in number: the first, facing Piccadilly, being the reception-room. The several apartments are decorated in that quiet, elegant style by which the older London mansions of our nobility are so happily distinguished ... It is customary, at rÃ©unions like the present, to assemble models of new inventions, rare works of art, and other productions of genius, for the gratification of the company'.\nYou can read reports of Perigal's contributions to these soirÃ©es at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nPerigal's incorrect views on astronomy did not prevent him being elected a fellow of the\nRoyal Astronomical Society\n(\nhe was elected on\n8\nFebruary\n1850)\n. Pparticularly given his friendship with several fellows of the\nRoyal Society of London\n, including the president, the Marquess of Northampton, he hoped also for election to the\nRoyal Society of London\n. Frederick Perigal writes in\n[\n10\n]\n:-\nMr Perigal was desirous of being elected a Fellow of the\nRoyal Society\n, believing that his investigations in curvilinear motion; his mechanical contrivances; and his services in various branches of science, entitled him to that distinction; but he was aware that his known opinions, respecting certain dogmas relating to Astronomy - not being orthodox - would be likely to militate against his admission; and so it proved when his name was put to the vote\n(\nwhen it is probable that many of his personal friends voted adversely\n)\n; he was naturally disappointed with the result, but observed that his possessing an open mind in all questions, and not adopting doctrines without his judgment assented thereto, should be a reason in his favour, instead of against him.\nPerigal's completely false idea that the Moon did not rotate seems to have become one of the main obsessions in his life. There must have been a debate about it at the Astronomical Club in January\n1865\nwhen\nJohn Couch Adams\nargued the case for the moon to rotate and Perigal the case for non-rotation. His diary entry for\n13\nJanuary\n1865\nreads\n[\n10\n]\n:-\nDined with the Astronomical Club; after dinner, the question as to the moon's rotation was put to the vote, when the numbers were:\n10\nfor\nAdams\nand rotation,\n11\nfor Perigal and non-rotation.\nThis shows that, even among astronomers, he was not alone in his false beliefs.\nAugustus De Morgan\nreviewed one of Perigal's 'moon theory' papers in\n[\n3\n]\nand writes:-\nMr Henry Perigal helped me twenty years ago with the diagrams, direct from the lathe to the wood, for the article 'Trochoidal Curves,' in the 'Penny Cyclopaedia'; these cuts add very greatly to the value of the article, which, indeed, could not have been made intelligible without them. He has had many years' experience, as an amateur turner, in combination of double and triple circular motions, and has published valuable diagrams in profusion. A person to whom the double circular motion is familiar in the lathe naturally looks upon one circle moving upon another as in simple motion, if the second circle be fixed to the revolving radius, so that one and the same point of the moving circle travels upon the fixed circle.\nMr Perigal commenced his attack upon the moon for moving about her axis, in the first of the tracts above\n[\nOn the phenomena arising from the diurnal rotation of the Earth on its own axis, and its annual revolution round the Sun\n]\n, ten years before Mr Jellinger Symons, but he did not think it necessary to make it a subject for the 'Times' newspaper; His familiarity with combined motions enabled him to handle his arguments much better than Mr J Symons could do: in fact, he is the clearest assailant of the lot that turned out with Mr J Symons. But he is as wrong as the rest. The assault is now I suppose, abandoned, until it becomes epidemic again. This it will do: it is one of those fallacies which are very tempting. There was a dispute on the subject in\n1748\n, between James Ferguson and an anonymous opponent; and I think there have been others.\nPerigal never gave up trying to convince others that the moon did not rotate\n[\n4\n]\n:-\n... there is no masking the fact that he was a paradoxer pure and simple, his main conviction being that the Moon did not rotate, and his main astronomical aim in life being to convince others, and especially young men not hardened in the opposite belief, of their grave error. To this end he made diagrams, constructed models, and wrote poems; bearing with heroic cheerfulness the continued disappointment of finding none of them of any avail.\nOthers were motivated by Perigal's curves. For example, in\n1865\nEdward Sang\npublished the paper\nOn the Contact of the Loops of Epicycloidal Curves\nin volume\n24\nthe\nTransactions\nof the\nRoyal Society of Edinburgh\n.\nSang\nbegins the paper as follows:-\nDuring the summer vacation, Mr Henry Perigal of London proposed to me the following problem: \"To determine the proportions of an epicycloid of which the loops touch each other.\"\nThe solution of this problem contains some points of interest to the general  analyst, and exhibits relations between certain trigonometric formulae and algebraic equations. I, therefore, offer an outline of it to the attention of the\nRoyal Society of Edinburgh\n. Mr Perigal had obtained the solution, in a considerable variety of cases by the method of trial, aided by mechanical appliances, and has exhibited them in his beautiful series of machine-engraved epicycloids.\nAnother example is Perigal's offer, in\n1868\n, of a prize of Â£\n10\nif somebody could identify a curve he had discovered with his 'two circles machine'.\n[\nNote. Â£\n10\nin\n1868\nis the equivalent of over Â£\n1000\ntoday.\n]\nWho found Perigal's curve and won the generous prize? None other than\nJames Clerk Maxwell\n.\nMany of Perigal's inventions are now held by the South Kensington Museum. In their\n1876\nCatalogue of the Special Loan Collection of Scientific Apparatus\n[\n14\n]\nthe following seven items devised by Perigal are listed:\nCompound Geometric Chuck,\nproducing the kinematic retrogressive parabola, by continuous motion; either on a moving plane by a fixed point, or on a fixed plane by a moving point.\n\"Soldier Experiment.\"\nModel designed to demonstrate the relative effects of revolution and of rotation, separate or combined, by the movements of soldiers.\nCompass Experiment\n, demonstrating that a magnetised needle does, but an unmagnetised needle does not, maintain its parallelism while revolving in a circle.\nGyroscope\n, demonstrating the effects of revolution and of rotation, the two ways of turning round.\nGyroscope\n, demonstrating that revolution alone will account for our always seeing the same face of the moon.\nSelenoscope\n, to demonstrate the kinematic effects of the three hypotheses of the moon's motion, as a satellite of the earth.\nKinescopes\n, illustrating the laws of compound circular motion, by ocular demonstrations of their representative curves, shown by bright beads revolving with great rapidity.\nWe have noted that Perigal was elected to the\nRoyal Astronomical Society\nin\n1850\n; he had been proposed by\nDe Morgan\n. He also had long memberships of other societies, most notably the Royal Meteorological Society which was founded as The British Meteorological Society on Wednesday\n3\nApril\n1850\n. Perigal  joined the Society on\n4\nJune\n1850\nand he was appointed Treasurer of the Society on\n24\nMay\n1853\n. He held that office continuously until his death\n45\nyears later, by which time the Society had changed its name twice, to 'The Meteorological Society' in\n1866\nand the 'Royal Meteorological Society' in\n1883\n. For the fortieth anniversary of his appointment as Treasurer, a dinner was given in his honour, see\n[\n2\n]\n. Perigal was also a member of the\nLondon Mathematical Society\n, being elected on\n23\nJanuary\n1868\n[\n12\n]\n:-\nWhen our Society was formed\n[1865]\nhe would have liked to join it at once, but feared that his paradoxical views on the subject of astronomical motions would disqualify him; he was much pleased therefore when, some years later,\nDe Morgan\noffered to propose him as a member and signed his nomination form.\nHe served on the Council of the Royal Microscopical Society and attended meetings of the Royal Institution for many years, becoming a member in\n1895\nat the age of\n94\n[\n13\n]\n:-\n... supported by various dignified figures: chemist William Crookes, electricians William Preece and David Hughes, physicists\nC V Boys\nand Silvanus Thompson, and Augustus Stroh, the inventor of the horn violin.\nHe was elected to the Association for the Improvement of Geometrical Teaching in\n1874\n. He was enthusiastic about all these societies\n[\n12\n]\n:-\nHe was a member of the Astronomical, Microscopical, Meteorological, Photographic, and several other scientific Societies, and a very regular attendant at the meetings of all, usually staying to the end, and often being the last to leave; and it may be said that for thirty or forty years, during eight months of the year, he divided his time between daily office work at\n29\nThreadneedle Street and evening attendance at the meetings of scientific societies, the lectures at the Royal Institution, &c.\nAs to Perigal's character, the following description is given in\n[\n12\n]\n:-\nHe was a warm friend, and a pleasant companion, gentle in manner, amiable, kind-hearted, and generous, interested in the topics of the day, and shrewd without being cynical. He rarely left London, and probably never went abroad in the last half of his life. At some time he had made a voyage to Madeira. Twenty years or more ago he let his beard grow, and since then his refined face, slight and fragile form, and long white beard and hair, made him a striking and picturesque figure. He ceased to attend scientific meetings two or three years ago, and for the last year or more had ceased to leave his lodgings; but there was no failure of mind or eye-sight.\nWe can see something of his character from his calling cards which depict what he considered to be his \"best\" results. Here are three of the cards, his \"parabola\", \"figure-of-eight curves\", and his \"\nPythagoras\ndissection\":\nÂ Â\nÂ Â\nPerigal remained remarkably fit and healthy until well into his\n90\ns\n[\n4\n]\n:-\nHe was remarkably vigorous until the last few years, and it may be recorded that on the occasion of the\n90\nth birthday of Sir\nG B Airy\n[27\nJuly\n1891]\n- which was celebrated on Saturday\n25\nJuly by a reception at the White House, Greenwich Park - Mr Perigal walked up the steep Croom's Hill to the reception without apparently the least distress, being himself a year older that the distinguished nonagenarian. During the last year or two, however, his strength had failed, and he died peacefully on\n6\nJune\n1898\n.\nAfter he died his wishes were carried out that he be cremated at Woking in Surrey, and his ashes were buried in the churchyard of the Church of St Mary and St Peter in Wennington, Essex. His tomb carries several inscriptions and diagrams of his\nPythagoras\ndissection theorem and his parabola construction. See\nTHIS LINK\n.",
