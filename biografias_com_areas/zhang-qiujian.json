  "biografia": "Zhang Qiujian\n's name is sometimes written as\nChang Ch'iu-Chin\nor\nChang Ch'iu-chien.\nZhang Qiujian wrote his mathematical text\nZhang Qiujian suanjing\n(\nZhang Qiujian's Mathematical Manual\n)\nsome time between\n468\nand\n486\n. No other work by Zhang Qiujian is known, and nothing about its author is known. In fact. although the dats we give are based on the best available evidence, some authors place Zhang Qiujian\n100\nyears earlier than we have done. At least the reader should be aware of this lack of knowledge. This article therefore can amount to nothing more than a look at the text and see if any deductions about the author can be made from looking at his treatise.\nThe book comprises of three chapters, with\n32\nproblems in the first chapter,\n22\nproblems in the second, and\n38\nproblems in the third chapter. Each problem is followed by an answer and many are followed by a description of the method of determining the answer. However, no reasons are given for the method of solution. There are problems on extracting square and cube roots, problems on finding the solution to quadratic equations, problems on finding the sum of an arithmetic progression, and on solving systems of linear equations. There are problems concerned with proportions, compound proportions, and proportional parts. There are also geometric problems, which depend on knowing the relevant formulae for areas and volumes.\nThe treatise is written in a similar style to the\nNine Chapters on the Mathematical Art\nbut the problems which it considers are usually more advanced. The book certainly represents progress in Chinese mathematics beyond the\nNine Chapters\non the Mathematical Art. Much of the book is designed to give the reader practice at manipulating fractions. Zhang states in his preface:-\nAnyone who studies mathematics should not be afraid of the difficulty of multiplication and division, but should be afraid of the mysteries of manipulating fractions.\nIf manipulating fractions is hard then the student will need practice. Zhang asks the reader to divide\n12380\n7\n\\large\\frac{12380}{7}\\normalsize\n7\n1\n2\n3\n8\n0\nâ\nby\n138\n5\n\\large\\frac{138}{5}\\normalsize\n5\n1\n3\n8\nâ\nin Problem\n5\nof Chapter\n1\nand to calculate\n(\n6587\n+\n2\n3\n+\n3\n4\n)\n(6587 + \\large\\frac{2}{3}\\normalsize + \\large\\frac{3}{4}\\normalsize )\n(\n6\n5\n8\n7\n+\n3\n2\nâ\n+\n4\n3\nâ\n)\ndivided by\n58\n1\n2\n(\n=\n117\n2\n)\n58 \\large\\frac{1}{2}\\normalsize (= \\large\\frac{117}{2}\\normalsize )\n5\n8\n2\n1\nâ\n(\n=\n2\n1\n1\n7\nâ\n)\nin the next problem. He gives the reader the same method of dividing fractions as taught in schools today, namely invert the divisor and multiply.\nIn particular Zhang sees the reduction of fractions to a common denominator as hard. He therefore gives problems which will help the reader. For example Problem\n10\nin Chapter\n1\nreads:-\nA circular road around a hill is\n325\nli long. Three persons A, B, and C run along the road. A runs\n150\nli per day, B runs\n120\nli per day, and C runs\n90\nli per day. If they start at the same time from the same place, after how many days will they meet again.\nThe method Zhang gives is to find the greatest common divisor of\n150\n,\n120\nand\n90\n. This is\n30\n. Then divide the length of the road by the greatest common divisor to get\n325\n30\n=\n10\n5\n6\n\\large\\frac{325}{30}\\normalsize = 10 \\large\\frac{5}{6}\\normalsize\n3\n0\n3\n2\n5\nâ\n=\n1\n0\n6\n5\nâ\ndays.\nIn Problem\n22\nof Chapter\n2\nsegments of a circle are considered. The chord of the segment is given, as is its area, and the student is asked to compute its height\n(\nthe length of the perpendicular bisector of the chord to the circle\n)\n. Zhang gives the solution by solving a quadratic equation, but his formulae are not particularly accurate. Martzloff\n[\n2\n]\npoints out that the length as calculated by Zhang in this problem is in error by about\n14\n%.\nIn Chapter\n3\nproblems which involve solving systems of equations occur. For example Problem\n4\nof Chapter\n3\n:-\nThere are three persons, A, B, and C each with a number of coins. A says \"If I take\n2\n3\n\\large\\frac{2}{3}\\normalsize\n3\n2\nâ\nof B's coins and\n1\n3\n\\large\\frac{1}{3}\\normalsize\n3\n1\nâ\nof C's coins then I hold\n100\n\". B says If I take\n2\n3\n\\large\\frac{2}{3}\\normalsize\n3\n2\nâ\nof A's coins and\n1\n2\n\\large\\frac{1}{2}\\normalsize\n2\n1\nâ\nof C's coins then I hold\n100\ncoins\". C says \"If I take\n2\n3\n\\large\\frac{2}{3}\\normalsize\n3\n2\nâ\nof A's coins and\n2\n3\n\\large\\frac{2}{3}\\normalsize\n3\n2\nâ\nof B's coins, then I hold\n100\ncoins\". Tell me how many coins do A, B, and C hold?\nA modern solution sets\nA\nA\nA\nto have\nx\nx\nx\ncoins,\nB\nB\nB\nto have\ny\ny\ny\nand\nC\nC\nC\nto have\nz\nz\nz\n. Then\nx\n+\n1\n3\n2\ny\n+\n1\n3\nz\n=\n100\n1\n3\n2\nx\n+\ny\n+\n1\n2\nz\n=\n100\n1\n3\n2\nx\n+\n1\n3\n2\ny\n+\nz\n=\n100\nx + \\large\\frac{1}{3}\\normalsize 2y + \\large\\frac{1}{3}\\normalsize z = 100\\newline\\large\\frac{1}{3}\\normalsize 2x + y + \\large\\frac{1}{2}\\normalsize z = 100\\newline\\large\\frac{1}{3}\\normalsize 2x + \\large\\frac{1}{3}\\normalsize 2y + z = 100\nx\n+\n3\n1\nâ\n2\ny\n+\n3\n1\nâ\nz\n=\n1\n0\n0\n3\n1\nâ\n2\nx\n+\ny\n+\n2\n1\nâ\nz\n=\n1\n0\n0\n3\n1\nâ\n2\nx\n+\n3\n1\nâ\n2\ny\n+\nz\n=\n1\n0\n0\ngiving\nx\n=\n60\n,\ny\n=\n45\n,\nz\n=\n30\nx = 60, y = 45, z = 30\nx\n=\n6\n0\n,\ny\n=\n4\n5\n,\nz\n=\n3\n0\n.\nThe method Zhang uses is essentially Gaussian elimination on the matrix of coefficients.\nProblem\n38\nof Chapter\n3\nis perhaps the most famous in the whole of Zhang's treatise:-\nHundred fowls problem: Cockerels costs\n5\nqian each, hens\n3\nqian each and three chickens cost\n1\nqian. If\n100\nfowls are bought for\n100\nqian, how many cockerels, hens and chickens are there?\nZhang gives three possible answers.\n4\ncockerels costing a total of\n20\nqian,\n18\nhens costing a total of\n54\nqian and\n78\nchickens costing a total of\n26\nqian.\n8\ncockerels costing a total of\n40\nqian,\n11\nhens costing a total of\n33\nqian and\n81\nchickens costing a total of\n27\nqian.\n12\ncockerels costing a total of\n60\nqian,\n4\nhens costing a total of\n12\nqian and\n84\nchickens costing a total of\n28\nqian.\nThese are all the possible answers\n(\none would not expect Zhang to come up with\n0\ncockerels,\n25\nhens and\n75\nchickens\n)\n.\nWe do not know if Zhang had a systematic method to solve problems of this type or whether he solved them by trial and error.\nIn\n656\n, after editing by\nLi Chunfeng\n, the treatise\nZhang Qiujian suanjing\n(\nZhang Qiujian's Mathematical Manual\n)\nbecame a text for the Imperial examinations and it became one of\nThe Ten Classics\nwhen reprinted in\n1084\n.\nCan we say anything about Zhang himself? Well, the text is very clearly written with good explanations. Examples are well chosen to illustrate what Zhang is trying to teach rather than for particularly practical purposes. We can certainly deduce that Zhang was a fine teacher and may well have had experience in teaching, to be able to write with so much knowledge of how students learn.",
