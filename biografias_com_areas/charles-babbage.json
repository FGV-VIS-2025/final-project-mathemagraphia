  "biografia": "Both the date and place of\nCharles Babbage\n's birth were uncertain but have now been firmly established. In\n[\n1\n]\nand\n[\n12\n]\n, for example, his date of birth is given as\n26\nDecember\n1792\nand both give the place of his birth as near Teignmouth. Also in\n[\n18\n]\nit is stated:-\nLittle is known of Mr Babbage's parentage and early youth except that he was born on\n26\nDecember\n1792\n.\nHowever, a nephew wrote to\nThe Times\na week after the obituary\n[\n18\n]\nappeared, saying that Babbage was born on\n26\nDecember\n1791\n. There was little evidence to prove which was right until Hyman\n(\nsee\n[\n8\n]\n)\nin\n1975\nfound that Babbage's birth had been registered in St Mary's Newington, London on\n6\nJanuary\n1792\n. Babbage's father was Benjamin Babbage, a banker, and his mother was Betsy Plumleigh Babbage. Given the place that his birth was registered Hyman says in\n[\n8\n]\nthat it is almost certain that Babbage was born in the family home of\n44\nCrosby Row, Walworth Road, London.\nBabbage suffered ill health as a child, as he relates in\n[\n4\n]\n:-\nHaving suffered in health at the age of five years, and again at that of ten by violent fevers, from which I was with difficulty saved, I was sent into Devonshire and placed under the care of a clergyman\n(\nwho kept a school at Alphington, near Exeter\n)\n, with instructions to attend to my health; but, not to press too much knowledge upon me: a mission which he faithfully accomplished.\nSince his father was fairly wealthy, he could afford to have Babbage educated at private schools. After the school at Alphington he was sent to an academy at Forty Hill, Enfield, Middlesex where his education properly began. He began to show a passion for mathematics but a dislike for the classics. On leaving the academy, he continued to study at home, having an Oxford tutor to bring him up to university level. Babbage in\n[\n4\n]\nlists the mathematics books he studied in this period with the tutor:-\nAmongst these were Humphry Ditton's 'Fluxions', of which I could make nothing; Madame\nAgnesi\n's 'Analytical Instructions' from which I acquired some knowledge;\nWoodhouse\n's 'Principles of Analytic Calculation', from which I learned the notation of\nLeibniz\n; and\nLagrange\n's 'ThÃ©orie des Fonctions'. I possessed also the 'Fluxions' of\nMaclaurin\nand of\nSimson\n.\nBabbage entered Trinity College, Cambridge in October\n1810\n. However the grounding he had acquired from the books he had studied made him dissatisfied with the teaching at Cambridge. He wrote\n[\n4\n]\n:-\nThus it happened that when I went to Cambridge I could work out such questions as the very moderate amount of mathematics which I then possessed admitted, with equal facility, in the dots of\nNewton\n, the d's of\nLeibniz\n, or the dashes of\nLagrange\n. I thus acquired a distaste for the routine of the studies of the place, and devoured the papers of\nEuler\nand other mathematicians scattered through innumerable volumes of the academies of St Petersburg, Berlin, and Paris, which the libraries I had recourse to contained.\nUnder these circumstances it was not surprising that I should perceive and be penetrated with the superior power of the notation of\nLeibniz\n.\nIt is a little difficult to understand how\nWoodhouse\n's\nPrinciples of Analytic Calculation\nwas such an excellent book from which to learn the methods of\nLeibniz\n, yet\nWoodhouse\nwas teaching\nNewton\n's calculus at Cambridge without any reference to\nLeibniz\n's methods.\nWoodhouse\nwas one of Babbage's teachers at Cambridge yet he seems to have taken no part in the Society that Babbage was to set up to try to bring the modern continental mathematics to Cambridge.\nBabbage tried to buy\nLacroix\n's book on the differential and integral calculus but this did not prove easy in this period of war with Napoleon. When he did find a copy of the work he had to pay seven guineas for it - an incredible amount of money in those days. Babbage then thought of setting up a Society to translate the work\n[\n4\n]\n:-\nI then drew up the sketch of a society to be instituted for translating the small work of\nLacroix\non the Differential and Integral Calculus. It proposed that we should have periodical meetings for the propagation of d's; and consigned to perdition all who supported the heresy of dots. It maintained that the work of\nLacroix\nwas so perfect that any comment was unnecessary.\nBabbage talked with his friend Edward Bromhead\n(\nwho would become\nGeorge Green\n's friend some years later- see the article on\nGreen\n)\nwho encouraged him to set up his Society. The Analytical Society was set up in\n1812\nand its members were all Cambridge undergraduates. Nine mathematicians attended the first meeting but the two most prominent members, in addition to Babbage, were\nJohn Herschel\nand\nGeorge Peacock\n.\nBabbage and\nHerschel\nproduced the first of the publications of the Analytical Society when they published\nMemoirs of the Analytical Society\nin\n1813\n. This is a remarkably deep work when one realises that it was written by two undergraduates. They gave a history of the calculus, and of the\nNewton\n,\nLeibniz\ncontroversy they wrote:-\nIt is a lamentable consideration, that that discovery which has most of any done honour to the genius of man, should nevertheless bring with it a train of reflections so little to the credit of his heart.\nTwo further publications of the Analytical Society were the joint work of Babbage,\nHerschel\nand\nPeacock\n. These are the English translation of\nLacroix\n's\nSur le calcul diffÃ©rentiel et intÃ©gral\npublished in\n1816\nand a book of examples on the calculus which they published in\n1820\n.\nBabbage had moved from Trinity College to Peterhouse and it was from that College that he graduated with a B.A. in\n1814\n. However, Babbage realised that\nHerschel\nwas a much more powerful mathematician than he was so\n[\n12\n]\n:-\nHe did not compete for honours, believing\nHerschel\nsure of first place and not caring to come out second.\nIndeed\nHerschel\nwas first\nWrangler\n,\nPeacock\ncoming second. Babbage married in\n1814\n, then left Cambridge in\n1815\nto live in London. He wrote two major papers on functional equations in\n1815\nand\n1816\n. Also in\n1816\n, at the early age of\n24\n, he was elected a fellow of the\nRoyal Society of London\n. He wrote papers on several different mathematical topics over the next few years but none are particularly important and some, such as his work on infinite series, are clearly incorrect.\nBabbage was unhappy with the way that the learned societies of that time were run. Although elected to the\nRoyal Society\n, he was unhappy with it. He was to write of his feelings on how the\nRoyal Society\nwas run:-\nThe Council of the\nRoyal Society\nis a collection of men who elect each other to office and then dine together at the expense of this society to praise each other over wine and give each other medals.\nHowever in\n1820\nhe was elected a fellow of the\nRoyal Society of Edinburgh\n, and in the same year he was a major influence in founding the\nRoyal Astronomical Society\n. He served as secretary to the\nRoyal Astronomical Society\nfor the first four years of its existence and later he served as vice-president of the Society.\nBabbage, together with\nHerschel\n, conducted some experiments on magnetism in\n1825\n, developing methods introduced by\nArago\n. In\n1827\nBabbage became Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge, a position he held for\n12\nyears although he never taught. The reason why he held this prestigious post yet failed to carry out the duties one would have expected of the holder, was that by this time he had become engrossed in what was to became the main passion of his life, namely the development of mechanical computers.\nBabbage is without doubt the originator of the concepts behind the present day computer. The computation of logarithms had made him aware of the inaccuracy of human calculation around\n1812\n. He wrote in\n[\n4\n]\n:-\n... I was sitting in the rooms of the Analytical Society, at Cambridge, my head leaning forward on the table in a kind of dreamy mood, with a table of logarithms lying open before me. Another member, coming into the room, and seeing me half asleep, called out, Well, Babbage, what are you dreaming about?\" to which I replied \"I am thinking that all these tables\"\n(\npointing to the logarithms\n)\n\"might be calculated by machinery.\"\nCertainly Babbage did not follow up this idea at that time but in\n1819\n, when his interests were turning towards astronomical instruments, his ideas became more precise and he formulated a plan to construct tables using the method of differences by mechanical means. Such a machine would be able to carry out complex operations using only the mechanism for addition. Babbage began to construct a small difference engine in\n1819\nand had completed it by\n1822\n. He announced his invention in a paper\nNote on the application of machinery to the computation of astronomical and mathematical tables\nread to the\nRoyal Astronomical Society\non\n14\nJune\n1822\n.\nAlthough Babbage envisaged a machine capable of printing out the results it obtained, this was not done by the time the paper was written. An assistant had to write down the results obtained. Babbage illustrated what his small engine was capable of doing by calculating successive terms of the sequence\nn\n2\n+\nn\n+\n41\nn^{2} + n + 41\nn\n2\n+\nn\n+\n4\n1\n.\nThe terms of this sequence are\n41\n,\n43\n,\n47\n,\n53\n,\n61\n, ... while the differences of the terms are\n2\n,\n4\n,\n6\n,\n8\n, .. and the second differences are\n2\n,\n2\n,\n2\n, ..... The difference engine is given the initial data\n2\n,\n0\n,\n41\n; it constructs the next row\n2\n,\n(0\n+\n2)\n,\n[41\n+\n(0\n+\n2)]\n, that is\n2\n,\n2\n,\n43\n; then the row\n2\n,\n(2\n+\n2)\n,\n[43\n+\n(2\n+\n2)]\n, that is\n2\n,\n4\n,\n47\n; then\n2\n,\n6\n,\n53\n; then\n2\n,\n8\n,\n61\n; ... Babbage reports that his small difference engine was capable of producing the members of the sequence\nn\n2\n+\nn\n+\n41\nn^{2} + n + 41\nn\n2\n+\nn\n+\n4\n1\nat the rate of about\n60\nevery\n5\nminutes.\nBabbage was clearly strongly influenced by\nde Prony\n's major undertaking for the French Government of producing logarithmic and trigonometric tables with teams of people to carry out the calculations. He argued that a large difference engine could do the work undertaken by teams of people saving cost and being totally accurate.\nOn\n13\nJuly\n1824\nBabbage received a gold medal from the\nAstronomical Society\nfor his development of the difference engine. He then met the Chancellor of the Exchequer to seek public funds for the construction of a large difference engine. The\nRoyal Society\nhad already given positive advice to the government:-\nMr Babbage has displayed great talent and ingenuity in the construction of his machine for computation, which the committee thanks fully adequate to the attainment of the objects proposed by the inventory; and they consider Mr Babbage as highly deserving of public encouragement, in the prosecution of his arduous undertaking.\nHis initial grant was for Â£\n1500\nand he began work on a large difference engine which he believed he could complete in three years. He set out to produce an engine with\n[\n3\n]\n:-\n... six orders of differences, each of twenty places of figures, whilst the first three columns would each have had half a dozen additional figures.\nSuch an engine would easily have been able to compute all the tables that\nde Prony\nhad been calculating, and it was intended to have a printer to print out the results automatically. However the construction proceeded slower than had been expected. By\n1827\nthe expenses were getting out of hand.\nThe year\n1827\nwas a year of tragedy for Babbage; his father, his wife and two of his children all died that year. He own health gave way and he was advised to travel on the Continent. After his travels he returned near the end of\n1828\n. Further attempts to obtain government support eventually resulted in the Duke of Wellington, the Chancellor of the Exchequer and other members of the government visiting Babbage and inspecting the work for themselves. By February\n1830\nthe government had paid, or promised to pay, Â£\n9000\ntowards the project.\nIn\n1830\nBabbage published\nReflections on the Decline of Science in England\n, a controversial work that resulted in the formation, one year later, of the\nBritish Association for the Advancement of Science\n. In\n1834\nBabbage published his most influential work\nOn the Economy of Machinery and Manufactures\n, in which he proposed an early form of what today we call\noperational research\n.\nThe year\n1834\nwas the one in which work stopped on the difference engine. By that time the government had put Â£\n17000\ninto the project and Babbage had put Â£\n6000\nof his own money. For eight years from\n1834\nto\n1842\nthe government would make no decision as to whether to continue support. In\n1842\nthe decision not to proceed was taken by Robert Peel's government. Dubbey in\n[\n6\n]\nwrites:-\nBabbage had every reason to feel aggrieved about his treatment by successive governments. They had failed to understand the immense possibilities of his work, ignored the advice of the most reputable scientists and engineers, procrastinated for eight years before reaching a decision about the difference engine, misunderstood his motives and the sacrifices he had made, and ... failed to protect him from public slander and ridicule.\nBy\n1834\nBabbage had completed the first drawings of the analytical engine, the forerunner of the modern electronic computer. His work on the difference engine had led him to a much more sophisticated idea. Although the analytic engine never progressed beyond detailed drawings, it is remarkably similar in logical components to a present day computer. Babbage describes five logical components, the store, the mill, the control, the input and the output. The store contains\n[\n4\n]\n:-\n... all the variables to be operated upon, as well as all those quantities which had arisen from the results of other operations.\nThe mill is the analogue of the cpu in a modern computer and it is the place\n[\n4\n]\n:-\n... into which the quantities about to be operated upon are always bought.\nThe control on the sequence of operations to be carried out was by a Jacquard loom type device. It was operated by punched cards and the punched cards contained the program for the particular task\n[\n4\n]\n:-\nEvery set of cards made for any formula will at any future time recalculate the formula with whatever constants may be required.\nThus the Analytical Engine will possess a library of its own. Every set of cards once made will at any time reproduce the calculations for which it was first arranged.\nThe store was to hold\n1000\nnumbers each of\n50\ndigits, but Babbage designed the analytic engine to effectively have infinite storage. This was done by outputting data to punched cards which could be read in again at a later stage when needed. Babbage decided, however, not to seek government support after his experiences with the difference engine.\nBabbage visited Turin in\n1840\nand discussed his ideas with mathematicians there including\nMenabrea\n. During Babbage's visit,\nMenabrea\ncollected all the material needed to describe the analytical engine and he published this in October\n1842\n.\nLady Ada Lovelace\ntranslated\nMenabrea\n's article into English and added notes considerably more extensive than the original memoir. This was published in\n1843\nand included\n[\n7\n]\n:-\n... elaborations on the points made by Menabrea, together with some complicated programs of her own, the most complex of these being one to calculate the sequence of\nBernoulli numbers\n.\nAlthough Babbage never built an operational, mechanical computer, his design concepts have been proved correct and recently such a computer has been built following Babbage's own design criteria.\nSee\nTHIS LINK\n.\nHe wrote in\n1851\n(\nsee\n[\n7\n]\n)\n:-\nThe drawings of the Analytical Engine have been made entirely at my own cost: I instituted a long series of experiments for the purpose of reducing the expense of its construction to limits which might be within the means I could myself afford to supply. I am now resigned to the necessity of abstaining from its construction...\nDespite this last statement, Babbage never did quite give up hope that the analytical engine would be built writing in\n1864\nin\n[\n4\n]\n:-\n... if I survive some few years longer, the Analytical Engine will exist...\nAfter Babbage's death a committee,whose members included\nCayley\nand\nClifford\n, was appointed by the\nBritish Association\n[\n12\n]\n:-\n... to report upon the feasibility of the design, recorded their opinion that its successful realisation might mark an epoch in the history of computation equally memorable with that of the introduction of logarithms...\nThis was an underestimate. The construction of modern computers, logically similar to Babbage's design, have changed the whole of mathematics and it is even not an exaggeration to say that they have changed the whole world.",
