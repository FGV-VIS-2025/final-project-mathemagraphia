  "biografia": "Albert Ingham\n's father was Albert Edward Ingham\n(\nborn about\n1875\nin Northampton\n)\nwho was a foreman in a boot manufacturing factory. His mother was Annie Gertrude Ingham\n(\nborn about\n1876\nin Northampton\n)\n. Albert Edward Ingham\n(\nour mathematician\n)\nhad an older brother Christopher Augustus\n(\nborn about\n1897)\n, and two younger sisters Phyllis Gertrude\n(\nborn about\n1904)\nand Lilian Grace\n(\nborn about\n1910)\n.\nAlbert Ingham was educated at Stafford Grammar School, and from there he won a scholarship to Trinity College, Cambridge, in December\n1917\n. After spending a few months in the army towards the end of World War I, he began his studies in January\n1919\n. An outstanding undergraduate career saw him awarded distinction in the Mathematical Tripos and win a Smith's prize and the highest honours. In\n1922\nhe was elected to a fellowship at Trinity for a dissertation on the\nzeta function\nand his next four years were occupied only with research, a few months of which were spent at GÃ¶ttingen. During this time Ingham was greatly influenced by\nLittlewood\nwho gave him the advice to:-\n... work at a hard problem: you may not solve it but you'll solve another one.\nIn\n1926\nIngham was appointed a Reader at Leeds University but four years later returned to Cambridge as a university lecturer and a fellow of King's College, on the death of\nRamsey\n, and remained there for the rest of his life. He was elected a Fellow of the\nRoyal Society\nin\n1945\nand became a Reader in Mathematical Analysis in\n1953\n.\nHis book\nOn the distribution of\nprime numbers\npublished in\n1932\nwas his only book and it is a classic. Many of the ideas here, as in other work of Ingham's, came from the joint work undertaken by\nHarald Bohr\nand\nLittlewood\n. When his famous text\n[\n1\n]\n:-\n... ran out of print, Ingham could never be persuaded to prepare a second edition. The partial rewriting necessary to bring it up to date would have meant, with his exacting standards, more toil than he could face.\nIngham's work was on the\nRiemann\nzeta function, the\ntheory of numbers\n, the theory of series and Tauberian theorems.\nHe generalised work on the\nprime number theorem\nof\nHadamard\nand\nVallÃ©e Poussin\n. The result for which Ingham is best known, however, relates to\np\nn\n+\n1\nâ\np\nn\np_{n+1} - p_{n}\np\nn\n+\n1\nâ\nâ\np\nn\nâ\nwhere\np\nn\np_{n}\np\nn\nâ\ndenotes the\nn\nn\nn\nth prime. It was proved by Hoheisel in\n1930\nthat there is a constant\nk\nk\nk\nsuch that\np\nn\n+\n1\nâ\np\nn\n<\np\nn\nk\np_{n+1} - p_{n} < p_{n}^{k}\np\nn\n+\n1\nâ\nâ\np\nn\nâ\n<\np\nn\nk\nâ\nfor all sufficiently large\nn\nn\nn\n. In\nOn the difference between two consecutive primes\n(1937)\nIngham proved that the result holds for\nk\n=\n5\n8\nk = \\large\\frac{5}{8}\\normalsize\nk\n=\n8\n5\nâ\n.\nPÃ³lya\n, in\n1919\n, made the following conjecture:\nSuppose\nÎ»\n(\nn\n)\n=\n1\n\\lambda(n) = 1\nÎ»\n(\nn\n)\n=\n1\nif\nn\nn\nn\nhas an even number of prime factors, -\n1\nif\nn\nn\nn\nhas an odd number of prime factors\n(\ncounting multiplicities\n)\nthen let\nL\n(\nx\n)\nL(x)\nL\n(\nx\n)\nbe the sum of\nÎ»\n(\nn\n)\n\\lambda(n)\nÎ»\n(\nn\n)\nover all positive integers less than\nn\nn\nn\n. The conjecture is that\nL\n(\nx\n)\nâ¤\n0\nL(x) â¤ 0\nL\n(\nx\n)\nâ¤\n0\n.\nIngham, in\n1942\n, was able to find an ingenious method to show how a counterexample could be constructed. It still required computing power to find the counterexample and, using Ingham's method, a counterexample was found by R S Lehman in\n1960\nwhen he showed that\nL\n(\n906180359\n)\n=\n1\nL(906180359) = 1\nL\n(\n9\n0\n6\n1\n8\n0\n3\n5\n9\n)\n=\n1\n.\nSome of Ingham's work on number theory was carried further by\nLinnik\n. He also worked on Tauberian theorems. He proved results suggested by\nNorbert Wiener\n, and he applied methods which had first been developed by\nWiener\n.\nIngham led a life of great simplicity.\nBurkill\ndescribes it in these terms:-\nIt did not occur to him to want a car or a radio, let alone a television set. For forty years he used a Sunbeam bicycle that he had won as a school prize. He was an expert photographer: he developed his own colour films and did everything from first principles. He was a good cricketer ... who would have been of minor county class if he had been able to give the time.\nHe died while on a walking holiday in the mountains. He and his wife, Rose Marie Tuper-Carey whom he married in\n1932\n, had taken this type of holiday every summer for many years.\nIn\n[\n1\n]\nIngham is described in the following words:-\nIngham was the embodiment of meticulous accuracy. Nothing slipshod came from his hand, his tongue or his pen. He lectured with force and clarity. He would apply the same standards to chores\n(\nsuch as setting examination questions\n)\nover which most dons are sparing of time and effort. His friends believed that, if he could have treated trifles more lightly, some of the problems still intact might have been reduced by his magnificent analytic power.",
