  "biografia": "John T Graves\nwas the son of John Crosbie Graves\n(2\nJuly\n1776\n-\n13\nJanuary\n1835)\n, a lawyer by training who became Chief Police Magistrate for Dublin, and Helena Perceval\n(1786\n-\n1850)\n, the daughter of the Rev Charles Perceval\n(1751\n-\n1795)\nof Templehouse, County Sligo. John and Helena Graves were married in\n1806\nand they had six children: John Thomas Graves, the subject of this biography; Helena Clarissa Graves\n(1808\n-\n1871)\n; Robert Perceval Graves\n(1810\n-\n1893)\n; James Perceval Graves\n(1811\n-\n1852)\n;\nCharles Graves\n(1812\n-\n1899)\n, who also has a biography in this archive; and Caroline Graves\n(1819\n-\n1855)\n. We note that Robert Perceval Graves was the author of the\n3\n-volume work\nLife of Sir William Rowan Hamilton\n(\nHodges, Figgis and Co., Dublin,\n1882\n-\n1889)\n. In\n1814\n, when John was seven years old, the family moved into a new home, a magnificent Georgian house at\n12\nFitzwilliam Square, Dublin. A plot on Fitzwilliam Square had been leased by Viscount Fitzwilliam to the merchant Nathaniel Calwell who employed the builder and master carpenter Richard Knight to build the houses\n9\nto\n12\n. The Graves family acquired number\n12\nand members of the family lived there throughout the\n19\nth\ncentury.\nJohn, like his younger brother\nCharles Graves\n, was educated at a school run by the Rev Samuel Field at Westbury-on-Trym, near Bristol, Gloucestershire in England, where he was prepared for university. Returning to Ireland, he entered Trinity College, Dublin, in\n1823\n. One of his fellow students was\nWilliam Rowan Hamilton\nand the two soon became friends.\nHamilton\nhad studied\nClairaut\n's\nAlgebra\n,\nLaplace\n's\nMÃ©canique CÃ©leste\nâ\n(\nCelestial Mechanics\n)\nand\nNewton\n's\nPrincipia\nâ\n(\nMathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy\n)\nbefore entering Trinity College. He had also come to the attention of\nJohn Brinkley\n, the Andrews Professor of Astronomy at Trinity who was an excellent mathematician having studied the latest continental mathematics. This friendship with\nHamilton\nrapidly brought Graves into contact with the latest mathematics. Graves was also fortunate to benefit from the mathematical reforms that\nBartholomew Lloyd\nhad introduced at Trinity almost ten years before he began his studies there.\nBartholomew Lloyd\nhad become professor of mathematics at Trinity in\n1813\nand, taking over a department in which the teaching had been very old-fashioned with no calculus taught, he had quickly introduced the continental approach to calculus teaching from\nLacroix\n's textbook\nTraitÃ© Ã©lÃ©mentaire de calcul differÃ©ntiel et du calcul intÃ©gral\nâ\n(\nElementary treatise on differential and integral calculus\n)\n, from\nPoisson\n's\nTraitÃ© de mÃ©canique\nâ\n(\nTreatise on mechanics\n)\n, and from\nLaplace\n's\nMÃ©canique CÃ©leste\nâ\n(\nCelestial Mechanics\n)\n.\nAs an undergraduate, Graves excelled in science and classics but after graduating from Trinity College, Dublin, with a B.A. in\n1827\nhe decided that he wanted a career in law. However, in\n1826\n, while still an undergraduate, Graves had began to study complex logarithms and produced an extension of\nEuler\n's formulas for logarithms given in\nIntroductio in Analysin Infinitorum\nâ\n(\nIntroduction to the analysis of infinitesimals\n)\n(1748)\n. Graves felt that he had answered problems that had arisen concerning complex logarithms which had been argued over by\nGottfried Leibniz\nand\nJohann Bernoulli\n,\nLeonhard Euler\nand\nJean d'Alembert\n. He did not publish this work until\n1829\nwhen his paper\nAn Attempt to Rectify the Inaccuracy of some Logarithmic Formulae\nwas published in the\nPhilosophical Transactions\nof the\nRoyal Society of London\n. The paper, communicated by\nJohn Frederick William Herschel\n, was read on\n18\nDecember\n1828\n. It begins:-\nFrom the recent researches of MM\nPoisson\nand\nPoinsot\non angular section, and their discovery of error in trigonometrical formulae usually considered complete, my attention has been drawn to analogous incorrectness in logarithmic series. Accordingly, the end proposed in the present investigation is the exhibition in an amended form of two fundamental developments, as principles employed in their establishment admit of application in expanding by different methods various similar functions, and tend to elucidate other parts of the exponential theory.\nThis paper produced a considerable reaction from a number of mathematicians supporting his results, and a number who objected to them. Alexandre Vincent, a professor at the Royal College at Reims in France, claimed that earlier, in\n1825\n, he had found the same results as Graves but had not published them. Vincent's proof was published in\n1832\n.\nMartin Ohm\nalso claimed to have arrived at the same results earlier than Graves but he had published them in\nVersuch eines volkommen consequenten Systems der Mathematik\nâ\n(\nAttempt at a perfectly consistent system of mathematics\n)\n(1823)\n. However, this work only became known in Britain when the second edition appeared in\n1829\n. Graves was disappointed to find that others had found the results earlier but even more disappointed to find that several British mathematicians claimed that his results were incorrect. Both\nGeorge Peacock\nand\nJohn Herschel\nexpressed doubts concerning the validity of Graves' results and\nPeacock\nprinted his objections in his\nReport\nto the\nBritish Association for the Advancement of Science\nin\n1833\n.\nHamilton\n, however, strongly supported Graves' results and when he spoke at the\n1834\nmeeting of the\nBritish Association for the Advancement of Science\nin Edinburgh, he offered another proof of the results.\nHamilton\npresented the paper\nOn Conjugate Functions or Algebraic Couples, as tending to illustrate generally the Doctrine of Imaginary Quantities, and as confirming the Results of Mr Graves respecting the existence of Two independent Integers in the complete expression of an Imaginary Logarithm\n. He wrote, rather strangely, in the third person:-\nWhen translated into the language of imaginaries, they agree with the results respecting imaginary exponential functions, direct and inverse, which were published by Mr Graves in the 'Philosophical Transactions' for\n1829\n, and it was in meditating on those results of Mr Graves that Mr\nHamilton\nwas led, several years ago, to this theory of conjugate functions, as tending to illustrate and confirm them. For example, Mr Graves had found, for the logarithm of unity to the Napierian base,\n[\nan\n]\nexpression ... which is more general than the usual expression. This result of Mr Graves appeared erroneous to the author of the excellent Report on Algebra, which was lately printed for the Association; but it is confirmed by Mr\nHamilton\n's theory ...\nAugustus De Morgan\nexpressed doubts about the correctness of the results in\n1836\nand, in the same year Graves replied to\nDe Morgan\nby publishing in the\nPhilosophical Magazine\nan alternative and shorter proof in his paper\nOn the lately proposed logarithms of unity, in reply to Professor De Morgan\n.\nDe Morgan\nwas convinced by this proof writing:-\nI see no further objection to Mr Graves's system, but quite the contrary ... the extension may be highly useful, and I am happy to bear testimony to the ingenuity which suggested it, and the talent with which it has been carried out.\nHowever,\nPeacock\nwas still not convinced and had published a \"proof\" that Graves was wrong in his\nTreatise on Algebra\nof\n1830\n.\nDuncan Farquharson Gregory\npointed out the error in\nPeacock\n's \"proof\" in\n1837\nso, in the second edition of his\nTreatise on Algebra\nin\n1845\n,\nPeacock\nadmitted his error and gave a proof of Graves' result.\nWe have moved well ahead to complete the story of Graves'\n1826\nresults on complex logarithms which took nearly\n20\nyears before all were happy with it. Let us return to looking at Graves' career after he graduated and had decided to study law. After graduating from Trinity College, Dublin, he moved to the Inner Temple in London to gain legal qualifications. He gave his address as the Inner Temple when he submitted his logarithm paper to the\nRoyal Society of London\nin\n1828\n. Back in Ireland, he continued his legal training and entered the King's Inns, Dublin in\n1830\n. Moving to Oxford, he became an incorporated member of Oriel College on\n11\nNovember\n1830\nand was awarded an M.A. in the following year. Later in\n1831\nhe was called to the English bar as member of the Inner Temple. In\n1832\nhe was awarded an M.A. by Trinity College, Dublin. For the next few years Graves practised law.\nGraves was not too happy as a lawyer and applied for a position with the Irish Society. He was unsuccessful and wrote a letter to James David Forbes\n(1809\n-\n1868)\n, who was at that time professor of Natural Philosophy at the University of Edinburgh. The letter, dated\n11\nMarch\n1838\n, was sent from Graves' chambers at\n20\nSouthampton Buildings, Chancery Lane, London. In the letter, Graves, who was making an application to University College London, wrote:-\nI wish to make my escape from the bar, being fonder of literary and scientific than of professional pursuits.\nIn\n1839\nGraves was appointed as a Professor of Jurisprudence at University College, London. In the same year he was elected a fellow of the\nRoyal Society of London\n. Soon after taking up his professorship, Graves was elected as an examiner in laws for the University of London. Working at University College London, Graves was now a colleague of\nAugustus De Morgan\nand the two became close friends. The Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge had been set up by the same reformers who founded London University and\nDe Morgan\nwas an enthusiast for the Society. Graves and\nDe Morgan\nserved together on the Society's committee.\nGraves had certainly not given up mathematics but had continued to correspond with\nHamilton\n. In fact his early work on logarithms was undertaken since he believed that it might lead to the discovery of new imaginary numbers. Graves continued to work on the idea but he thought about such things in a rather different way from\nHamilton\nwho wrote to him in\n1835\n(\nsee for example\n[\n5\n]\n)\n:-\n... we belong to opposite poles in algebra since you, like\nPeacock\n, seem to consider algebra as a 'system of signs and their combinations', somewhat analogous to syllogisms expressed in letters while I am never satisfied unless I think that I can look beyond or through the signs to the things signified.\nGraves' ideas regarding possible new complex numbers continued and he tried to multiply lines in space given by triples. In corresponding with\nHamilton\nand telling him about his ideas in this area, he kept\nHamilton\n's interest in generalising complex numbers to three dimensions. After\nHamilton\nmade his discovery of the\nquaternions\nin\n1843\nthe first person he wrote to telling of his discovery was Graves who replied on\n26\nOctober complimenting\nHamilton\non his novel idea and adding\n(\nsee for example\n[\n5\n]\n)\n:-\nThere is still something in the system which gravels me. I have not yet any clear views as to the extent to which we are at liberty arbitrarily to create imaginaries, and to endow them with supernatural properties.\nThe reason that it was Graves that he turned to first was, as\nHamilton\nexplained in a letter to the\nPhilosophical Magazine\non\n20\nNovember\n1844\n, because his discussions with Graves had played an important role in the discovery. You can read part of\nHamilton\n's letter at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nIn this letter\nHamilton\nmentions some extensions of the quaternions which had been discovered by Graves. In fact in volume\n3\nof the\nProceedings of the Royal Irish Academy\n(1836\n-\n1869)\nwe see precisely how Graves explained his discoveries to\nHamilton\n:-\nIn a letter dated January\n18\nth\n,\n1844\n, Mr Graves communicated to Sir\nWilliam Hamilton\nhis theorem respecting sums of eight squares ... In a letter of somewhat earlier date, but evidently written in haste, upon a journey, and dated December\n26\nth\n,\n1843\n, analogous expressions had been given, containing, however, some errors in the signs, which were soon afterwards corrected as above. That earlier letter also indicated an expectation that a theory of octaves, including a new and extended system of imaginaries, which had thus been suggested to the writer\n(\nJ T Graves, Esq.\n)\nby Sir\nWilliam R Hamilton\n's theory of quaternions, might itself be extended so as to form a theory of what Mr Graves at the time proposed to call\n2\nn\n2^{n}\n2\nn\n-ions: but in a letter written shortly afterwards, doubts were expressed respecting the possibility of this additional extension, from octaves to sets of sixteen.\nThe octaves, which are mentioned in this quote, are today called the octonions or\nCayley\nnumbers and not, as one might expect, the Graves numbers. The events which led to this are as follows.\nHamilton\nwas too busy to report on Graves' findings until after the same\n8\n-dimensional system had been constructed by\nArthur Cayley\nand published in March\n1845\n. The quote above, which shows Graves' priority, was not published until\n14\nJune\n1847\n. This note contains Graves' Eight Squares Identity but even this remarkable result, which generalised\nEuler\n's Four Squares Identity, had been discovered before. The Danish mathematician Ferdinand Degen\n(1766\n-\n1825)\nseems to have been the first to discover this result in\nAdumbratio demonstrationis theorematis arithmeticae maxime generalis\nâ\n(\nOutline of the demonstration of the most general arithmetical theorem\n)\n(1818)\nwhich he published in the\nMÃ©moires de l'AcadÃ©mie ImpÃ©riale des Sciences de St PÃ©tersbourg\n. As an aside, we note that Degen was the mathematician to whom the young\nNiels Henrik Abel\nsubmitted his \"solution\" of the quintic equation. Degen asked\nAbel\nto give an example of his method and at that stage Abel himself discovered his error. Graves seems to be one of those people who made remarkable discoveries but luck was against him and he has almost been forgotten.\nFor further details of the Eight Squares Identity and Graves-\nCayley\nNumbers, see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nAt University College, London, Graves continued to seek systems of algebraic triplets even after\nHamilton\nhad discovered the quaternions. He clearly interested his colleague\nDe Morgan\nin this question as the comments on\nCharles Graves\n's publications on algebraic triplets show, see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nOn\n25\nApril\n1845\nthe first of twelve lectures by Graves on the law of nations were published in the\nLaw Times.\nHe also wrote\n[\n4\n]\n:-\n... two elaborate articles contributed to the 'Encyclopaedia metropolitana' on Roman law and canon law. He was also a contributor to Smith's 'Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography', his articles including very full lives of the jurists Cato, Crassus, Drusus, and Gaius, and one on the legislation of Justinian.\nOn\n24\nMarch\n1846\nGraves married Amelia Tooke, the daughter of William Tooke and Amelia Shaen. They had no children. William Tooke was a lawyer who become President of the Society of Arts. Before his marriage Graves had resigned his chair of Jurisprudence at University College, London, giving as the reason for his resignation the 'discouragingly low enrolment for his classes'. He stated that his lectures on Roman law, on international law and on general jurisprudence had been poorly attended in contrast with his lectures on practical topics such as the law of equity. In the same year that he married he was appointed as an assistant poor-law commissioner. In\n1847\nhe was promoted to one of the poor-law inspectors of England and Wales, a position which came into existence because of the Poor Laws that came into force in that year.\nThe botanist Sir Joseph Dalton Hooker\n(1817\n-\n1911)\nwrote to his fellow botanist John Stevens Henslow in\n1858\n:-\nI met a Rev J T Graves at Dublin, a Fellow of Trinity College, Dublin, mathematician, a man of renown in these parts who has been employed by the Government in enquiring on Endowed Schools and other Educational matters. He is immensely strong on your point of teaching the science of Observation to all men, especially the young of all classes, and he has reported the same to the Government in perhaps the very words you would have used.\nThis letter by Hooker does not mean that Graves had changed his profession since we see that Graves continued to write reports as a poor-law inspector up to at least\n1866\n.\nThere is one aspect of Graves' life which we have not mentioned so far and that was his life-long hobby as a collector of ancient mathematical texts. He bequeathed his collection to University College London, three days before he died at his home, Thirlestaine Lodge in Cheltenham at the age of sixty-three. Several articles describe his amazing collection but perhaps the best would be to quote from\n[\n3\n]\nsupplied by the library of University College, London:-\nThe library acquired contains over\n10\n,\n000\nbooks,\n4\n,\n600\npamphlets,\n51\nmanuscripts and numerous periodicals, covering mainly mathematics and astronomy. Described as probably the most important private mathematical collection ever made, it contains many rare and possibly unique items. Probably the most important single collection within the Graves material is the\nEuclid\ncollection, which contains eighty-three of the editions of\nEuclid\n's works printed before\n1640\n. The collection includes the 'editio princeps' published by Erhard Ratdolt at Venice in\n1482\n, and amongst the translations are the first into any modern language, the Italian of\n1543\n, the first German translation\n(1562)\n, the first French\n(1564)\n, John Day's edition of the first English translation with\nJohn Dee\n's preface of\n1570\n, the first edition in Arabic\n(1594)\nand later translations into Turkish, Chinese, Persian, Hebrew, Finnish and many other languages. The Graves collection includes seventy-five of the Library's incunabula and many famous books such as first editions of\nCopernicus\n's 'De revolutionibus' of\n1543\n,\nNewton\n's 'Principia' and 'Opticks', and Thomas Salusbury's 'Mathematical Collections' of\n1661\n-\n65\n. There are first editions of fascinating \"association copies\" of the works of Priestley,\nBoyle\n,\nKepler\n,\nGalileo\n, and\nNapier\nand important runs of early scientific periodicals. There are also many treasures such as Henry Cavendish's copy of\nPascal\n's 'TraitÃ© de l'Ã©quilibre des liqueurs' of\n1663\nand, of special note, a copy of\nGalileo\n's 'Il Saggiatore', published in Rome in\n1623\nand inscribed to\nGalileo\n's friend Morandi.",
