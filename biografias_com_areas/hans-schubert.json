  "biografia": "Hans Schubert\nwas born in Weida, which is about\n35\nkm south east of Jena. His father was Franz Gustav Schubert, a secretary with the national railway company, and his mother was Klara Emma GÃ¶tz. The family were members of the Evangelical Lutheran Church. In\n1918\n, when Hans was ten years old, he entered the\nRealgymnasium\nin the nearby town of Crimmitschau. He studied there until\n1927\nwhen he graduated from High School and entered the University of Leipzig. His interests at school had been in mathematics and physics and it was these subjects that he studied at university. In fact throughout his life he remained interested in applied mathematics and mathematical physics. His lecturers in mathematics at Leipzig included\nOtto HÃ¶lder\n,\nL Lichtenstein\nand\nPaul Koebe\n, while he was taught theoretical physics by\nHeisenberg\n. In fact\nHeisenberg\nwas appointed to a chair at Leipzig and started teaching there in the year in which Schubert began his undergraduate career. He had previously been with\nNiels Bohr\nin Copenhagen and was already a world leader having published his theory of quantum mechanics two years earlier; he received the Nobel prize for this work in\n1932\n.\nIt was the applied mathematician\nL Lichtenstein\nwho became Schubert's thesis advisor in\n1933\nand under his guidance Schubert wrote a thesis\nÃber einige Lichtensteinsche HilfssÃ¤tze der Potentialtheorie und ihre Anwendung auf die Hydrodynamik\nâ\n(\nAbout some lemmas of Lichtenstein on potential theory and its application to the hydrodynamics\n)\non potential theory and its applications to hydrodynamics. The thesis was submitted to the University of Leipzig in\n1935\nand he was awarded his doctorate on\n14\nJanuary\n1936\n. On\n1\nApril of that year Schubert was appointed as an assistant to\nH Schmidt\nin KÃ¶then, a position which he held until October. During this time, on\n23\nApril, he took the state examinations to qualify to teach in schools. The essay which he submitted for this examination was\nDie Mitwirkung mathematischer Begriffe im Aufbau von Leibniz' Metaphysik\n(\nDarstellung und Kritik\n)\nâ\n(\nInvolvement of mathematical concepts in the construction of Leibniz's metaphysics\n(\npresentation and criticism\n)\n)\n.\nThe years during which Schubert was undertaking research were the years during which there were huge changes in Germany. Hitler came to power in\n1933\nand within a year had proclaimed himself Chancellor and FÃ¼hrer of the German Reich. Germany had no air force since it was forbidden under the\n1919\ntreaty of Versailles signed after World War I. Hitler now ordered the creation of a German air force and began to rapidly expand the army and navy. In January\n1935\nhe regained the Saar region by holding a plebiscite, and in March\n1936\nGerman troops entered the Rhineland. In August\n1936\ntwo year conscription was declared in Germany. Schubert, with his expertise in hydrodynamics, was exactly the right person to work on aviation research and from\n1\nNovember\n1936\nuntil\n1\nApril\n1945\nhe undertook research at the aviation laboratory in Berlin-Adlershof.\nNow working in Berlin, Schubert took part in the mathematical activities that the city offered. He joined the\nGerman Mathematical Society\nand the Berlin Mathematical Society, both in\n1940\n. In\n1943\nhe submitted his habititation thesis\nZur Berechnung der Abwindkorrektur in der Strahlachse eines Windkanals von kreisfÃ¶rmigem Querschnitt bei BerÃ¼cksichtigung einer offenen Messtrecke\nâ\n(\nCalculating the wind correction in the beam axis of a wind tunnel of circular cross section in consideration of an open measuring section\n)\nto the Technische Hochschule in Darmstadt. Schubert had published eight papers between his doctoral thesis and his habititation thesis. These papers included\nÃber einige Eigenschaften elliptischer und nichtelliptischer TragflÃ¼gel\nâ\n(\nOn some properties of elliptic and non-elliptic hydrofoils\n)\n(1938)\nand\nZur Ermittlung der Auftriebsverteilung nichtelliptischer TragflÃ¼gel mit der Methode der sukzessiven Approximationen\nâ\n(\nDetermining the lift distribution of a non-elliptic aerofoil by the method of successive approximations\n)\n(1938)\nwhich were specifically related to his aviation research. Other papers such as\nEin potentialtheoretischer Hilfssatz\nâ\n(\nA potential theoretical lemma\n)\n(1940)\n, published in\nMathematische Zeitschrift\n, related to the work he had done on potential theory for his doctorate.\nAfter World War II ended, Schubert taught mathematics and physics at the Oberrealschule in Crimmitschau from\n1\nOctober\n1945\nto the\n31\nJanuary\n1947\n. However during the summer vacation in\n1946\nhe was a guest lecturer at the University of Leipzig. He was appointed as an extraordinary professor of mathematics at the University of Rostock and was due to take up his duties in the autumn of\n1946\nbut problems with heating at the university meant that it was closed until the spring of\n1947\n. Schubert, therefore, continued in his position as a school teacher until the end of January, taking up his duties at Rostock on\n1\nMarch\n1947\n, and lecturing on\nWhy applied mathematics?\nduring the summer semester. On\n21\nAugust he married KÃ¤te Falkenberg who was a teacher from Crimmitschau.\nOver the next two years Schubert turned down offers of posts at the University of Jena and at the Bergakademie in Freiberg. He was appointed a full professor at the University of Rostock on\n1\nApril\n1950\nbut on\n7\nSeptember\n1951\nHarry Schmidt\n, who held the chair of mathematics at the Martin-Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg, died and Schubert accepted the offer of the post, taking up his duties on\n1\nOctober\n1952\n. He remained at Halle for the rest of his career, being named Professor of Applied Mathematics in\n1960\nand Professor of Analysis in\n1969\n. Because of poor health, he retired early on\n1\nJanuary\n1970\n.\nLet us look briefly at some of the papers which Schubert published.\nÃber eine lineare Integrodifferentialgleichung mit Zusatzkern\nâ\n(\nOn a linear integro-differential with additional kernel\n)\n(1950)\nlooked at certain aerodynamical problems which lead to integrodifferential equations. In\nÃber ein gemischtes rÃ¤umliches Randwertproblem der Potentialtheorie\nI\nâ\n(\nOn a mixed spatial boundary value problem of potential theory I\n)\n(1951)\nhe considered the uniform flow of an incompressible ideal fluid past a small obstacle in an infinite cylindrical channel. Under certain conditions, he obtains solutions in terms of\nBessel\nand\nHankel\nfunctions and computes the resulting formulas for downwash. He continued this investigation in a second paper. In\nÃber die Potentiale der auf dem Mantel eines Kreiszylinders ausgebreiteten einfachen und doppelten Belegung\nâ\n(\nOn the spread of the potentials on the jacket of a circular cylinder and simple double occupancy\n)\n(1952)\nhe derives a\nFourier\nintegral representation containing\nBessel functions\nfor the axially symmetric potential induced by a simple and double layer on the surface of a circular cylinder. He wrote two papers with Erich Schincke, the first being\nZum Konturproblem der Hodographenmethode im Unterschall\nâ\n(\nThe contour problem of the subsonic hodographic method\n)\n(1959)\nin which they consider the problem of subsonic flow without circulation past a body of prescribed shape and symmetric about two perpendicular axes; the second paper being\nDie Berechnung einer zirkulationslosen UnterschallstrÃ¶mung um den Kreiszylinder mit der Hodographenmethode\nâ\n(\nThe calculation of a circulation-less subsonic flow around the circular cylinder with the hodographic method\n)\n(1959)\nin which they use a modification of the hodograph method to calculate an approximation to the ideal gas flow past a circular cylinder. In\n1970\n, the year he retired, Schubert published a survey of the literature on the\nPoincarÃ©\nboundary value problem.\nAt Halle Schubert taught a variety of different courses such as differential and integral calculus,  partial differential equation, and\nintegral equations\n. He was honoured in several ways. He was a member of the\nGerman Society for Applied Mathematics and Mechanics\n(1948)\n, and elected to the\nGerman Academy of Scientists Leopoldina\n(1959)\n. He was co-editor of the\nZeitschrift fÃ¼r Angewandte Mathematik und Mechanik\n(\nZAMM\n)\nfrom\n1959\nuntil his death.",
