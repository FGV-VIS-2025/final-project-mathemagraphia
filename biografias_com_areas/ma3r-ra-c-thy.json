  "biografia": "MÃ³r RÃ©thy\nwas born with the name Rothbaum but, in\n1871\n, he changed his name as a sign of solidarity with the Hungarian culture. Unlike most contemporary scientists he didn't come from a well-to-do family. His father, a man of high morality, was an outstanding teacher at the elementary school of NagykÃ¶rÃ¶s. However, he had a big family to care for so he was forced to give up teaching and he became a merchant.\nMÃ³r went to primary and to secondary school in his native town of NagykÃ¶rÃ¶s. Later he attended the Technical Universities of Vienna and Budapest. Meanwhile he worked for a year as an officer at the Central Postal and Telegraph Service to support his father. He graduated with a degree in mathematics and descriptive geometry from the Technical University of Budapest in\n1870\n. In the same year he married Etelka FinÃ¡ly, the sister of the famous classical-philology professor Henrik FinÃ¡ly. Following his graduation, RÃ©thy worked for two years as a teacher of mathematics and descriptive geometry at the Modern Technical School of KÃ¶rmÃ¶cbÃ¡nya.\nThanks to a state bursary suggested by Baron\nLorÃ¡nd EÃ¶tvÃ¶s\n, he had the opportunity to continue his studies at the famous universities of GÃ¶ttingen and Heidelberg. At GÃ¶ttingen he had the good fortune to be able to admire\nAlfred Clebsch\n's lectures and his wonderful way of teaching. Unfortunately, although only\n39\nyears old,\nClebsch\ndied of diphtheria in November\n1872\nand RÃ©thy had to face up to his sudden death. His first paper on the diffraction of light was presented at GÃ¶ttingen in\n1872\n. The second part of his bursary was spent at Heidelberg University, where\nKirchhoff\n,\nKÃ¶nigsberger\nand Schering assured him lifelong mental munition.\nLeo KÃ¶nigsberger\nand RÃ©thy remained in a close contact: RÃ©thy's nine letters from\n1875\nto\n1898\ncan still be found in the Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin Handschriftabteilung. He obtained his doctoral degree from Heidelberg University in\n1874\n.\nReturning home after the award of his doctorate, he was appointed extraordinary professor at the University of KolozsvÃ¡r. His seminars in mathematics - on elliptic functions, complex functions and determinants - gave a new colour to contemporary mathematical life. During his stay at KolozsvÃ¡r problems concerning of navigation, including the question of constructing the most efficient propeller, were the focus of interest. MÃ³r RÃ©thy took part in very fruitful debates between outstanding mathematicians of his age and soon enriched the literature with two papers on the topic. In\n1876\nhe was promoted professor in the Mathematical and Theoretical Physics Department at KolozsvÃ¡r.\nIn\n1878\nhe was elected a corresponding member of the\nHungarian Academy of Sciences\n. He was promoted to dean at KolozsvÃ¡r University, serving in this role on two separate occasions. From\n1884\nto\n1886\nhe was the Head of the Department of Elementary Mathematics.\nHis whole life was interwoven with analysing, communicating and developing the work of the two Bolyais. This theme began to dominate contemporary mathematical thinking\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nThe prelude was MÃ³r RÃ©thy's lecture delivered at KolozsvÃ¡r University in\n1874\n, which soon appeared in print. This paper throws light on RÃ©thy's efforts to introduce and popularize absolute geometry. His aim was to kindle interest in reading the Appendix itself, and with this in mind, he gave reformulations of several basic definitions and concepts\n(\nBolyai\n's definition of parallelism, the paracycle, parasphere, hypercycle, hypersphere\n)\nthat are easier to follow than their originals in the Appendix. And he went a step further: starting from the fact that in absolute geometry in infinitely small segments of space the theorems of Euclidean geometry hold true, and relying on the recognition that spherical trigonometry is independent of\nEuclid\n's\n5\nth\npostulate, RÃ©thy built up\nBolyai\n's trigonometry independently. Thus, he set the trend aiming at the simplest possible exploration of absolute trigonometry relying on the fewest possible axioms. Of the wealth of literature in this vein, let us only mention the articles by PÃ¡l SzÃ¡sz.\nAnother merit of RÃ©thy is that he was the first to review and elaborate the hyperbolic constructions of the Appendix in detail.\nIn\n1886\nMÃ³r RÃ©thy was invited to the Technical University of Budapest, where he first lectured on geometry. Then his interest turned to theoretical problems of physics and mechanics. From\n1892\nhe was professor of the Analytical Mechanics and Theoretical Physics Department. Similarly to his years at KolozsvÃ¡r, he served two spells as dean of the Technical University of Budapest. In\n1891\nhe became not only a founding member of the Mathematical and Physical Society\n(\ntoday named the\nJÃ¡nos Bolyai Mathematical Society\n)\n, but he worked as a committee member from its inception.\nMÃ³r RÃ©thy was one of the professors -\nGyula KÃ¶nig\n, ArpÃ¡d GeÃ¶tze,\nJenÃ¶ Hunyadi\n,\nGyula Farkas\netc. - who lectured both on mathematics and physics at a very high level.\n(\nAs stated in\n[\n1\n]\n)\nUnfortunately he is often referred to as either a mathematician or a physician in spite of the fact that he embodied both. Another problem is that though he was born in\n1846\nhis year of birth is often erroneously written\n1848\n. Of course the correct data can also be found: RÃ©thy, MÃ³r; frÃ¼her Rothbaum\n(1846\n-\n1925)\nPhysiker und Mathematike.\n)\nHis literary heritage is divided between mathematics and physics. Most of his work was published in Hungarian, but a great many papers were written in German or at least have been titled in English:\nÃber ein DualitÃ¤tsprinzip in der Geometrie\nâ\n(\nOn a duality principle in geometry\n)\n(1872)\n,\nThe so-called non-Euclidean plane trigonometry of the three-dimensional homogeneous space\n(1875\n, Hungarian\n)\n,\nDie Fundamentalgleichungen der nicht-euklidischen Geometrie auf elementare Wege abgeleitet\nâ\n(\nThe fundamental equations of non-Euclidean geometry derived from elementary paths\n)\n(1876)\n,\nA contribution to the theory of propeller and peripeller surfaces\n(1876\n, Hungarian\n)\n,\nTo the theory of the propeller\n(1877\n, Hungarian\n)\n,\nTheorie d. Reflexion und Brechung; Ueber die Polarisation d. gebeugten Lichts\nâ\n(\nTheory of reflection and refraction concerning the polarization of diffracted light\n)\n(1880)\n,\nEndlich-gleichen FlÃ¤chen\nâ\n(\nFinite equal surfaces\n)\n(1890\n&\n1891)\n,\nÃber endlich-gleichen FlÃ¤chen\nâ\n(\nOn finite equal surfaces\n)\n(1893)\n,\nEnd-like equal areas\n(1890\n&\n1893\n, Hungarian\n)\n,\nZum Beweise des Haupsatztes Ã¼ber die Endlichkeit zweier ebener Systeme\nâ\n(\nProvong fundamental theorems on the finiteness of two plane systems\n)\n(1894)\n,\nFlÃ¼ssigkeitsstrahlen in incompressiblen reibenslosen FlÃ¼ssigkeiten\nâ\n(\nLiquid jets in incompressible smooth fluids\n)\n(1894)\n,\nFluid currents\n(1894\n, Hungarian\n)\n,\nÃber das Princip der kleinsten Action,\n(\nund Ã¼ber das von Hamilton\n)\nâ\n(\nOn the principle of least action\n(\nand that of Hamilton\n)\n)\n(1896)\n,\nÃber schwere FlÃ¼ssigstrahlen\nâ\n(\nOn heavy liquid jets\n)\n(1898)\n,\nAn introduction to JÃ¡nos Bolyai's \"new, different world\"\n(1903\n, Hungarian\n)\n,\nDas Ostwaldsche Princip vom Energieumsatz in der Mechanik\nâ\n(\nThe Ostwald principle of energy conversion in mechanics\n)\n(1905)\n.\nIn\n1900\nMÃ³r RÃ©thy became a full-member of the\nHungarian Academy of Sciences\n. Regarding his results concerning hydrodynamics, because of his studies on end-like equal areas and finally his treaties on mechanical principles\n(\nand the fact that all of them created significant international interest\n)\nMÃ³r RÃ©thy was awarded the MarczibÃ¡nyi Prize by unanimous voting of the Committee of the\nHungarian Academy of Sciences\nin\n1904\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nEndowed with extreme modesty and working capacity, RÃ©thy was a person worthy of affection and an ardent servant of all Hungarian causes. His most significant essays deal with the legacy of the two Bolyais and the development of some of their results. Internationally, however, better known are RÃ©thy's investigations in physics. His results concerning the shape of jets of incompressible fluids - where he applied deep tools of function theory - were the basis for many a further investigation. Also well known is RÃ©thy's research into the Ostwald theory and into the classic \"principles\" of mechanics.\nAt the last decades of the\n19\nth\ncentury the\nHungarian Academy of Sciences\ndecided to bring into being the second edition of the two Bolyais' immortal work: the\nTentamen\nâ\n(\nAn attempt to introduce studious youths to the elements of pure mathematics\n)\n. Some outstanding scientists took part in that time-consuming enterprise, but it was only MÃ³r RÃ©thy, who persisted in doing so from the beginning to the end:-\nWolfgangi Bolyai de Bolya: Tentamen iuventutem studiosam in elementa matheseos purae elementaris ac sublimioris methodo intuitiva evidentiaque huic propria introducendi, cum appendice triplici\n(1897)\n(\nI. Conspectus arithmeticae generalis. Mandato Academiae scientiarum hungaricae suis adnotationibus adiectis ediderunt Julius KÃ¶nig et Mauritius RÃ©thy. - II. Elementa geometriae et appendices ... ediderunt Josephus KurschÃ¡k, Mauritius RÃ©thy, BÃ©la TÃ¶tÃ¶ssy de Zepethnek\n)\nâ\n(\nWolfgang Bolyai: An attempt to introduce the student to the elements of pure elementary mathematics and to a more sublime intuitive method and proofs proper to this, with a triple appendix.\n(1897)\n(\nPublished by order of the Academy of Sciences:\n1\n. General Conspectus of arithmetic -- Maurice Rethy, Julius Konig\n2\n. Elements of geometry and appendices -- Joseph Kurschak, Mauritius Rethy, Bela Totossy of Zepethnek\n)\n)\nAt the time of the celebrations of\nJÃ¡nos Bolyai\n's centenary MÃ³r RÃ©thy published an essay on the new different world of\nJÃ¡nos Bolyai\n. At that time he wrote something very personal in his diary\n[\n7\n]\n:-\nThe atmosphere of these celebrations led me back to the absolute geometry. Suddenly I have noticed that an error crept into the last sentence in the new edition of the Appendix. The remark concerning it originates from me.\nThe last quarter of MÃ³r RÃ©thy's life was shadowed by personal and historical losses: the decease of his second son as a victim of World War I, his four-year-old granddaughter's death; at the University the change of the atmosphere for the worse, further the separation from Transylvania, KolozsvÃ¡r, and his beloved garden at HÃ³ja.\nIn the last but one year of his life, on\n24\nJuly\n1924\n, he was awarded a Jubilee doctorate from Heidelberg University.",
