  "biografia": "Karl Weierstrass\n's father, Wilhelm Weierstrass, was secretary to the mayor of Ostenfelde at the time of Karl's birth. Wilhelm Weierstrass was a well educated man who had a broad knowledge of the arts and of the sciences. He certainly was well capable of attaining higher positions than he did, and this attitude may have been one of the reasons that Karl Weierstrass's early career was in posts well below his outstanding ability. Weierstrass's mother was Theodora Vonderforst and Karl was the eldest of Theodora and Wilhelm's four children, none of whom married.\nWilhelm Weierstrass became a tax inspector when Karl was eight years old. This job involved him in only spending short periods in any one place so Karl frequently moved from school to school as the family moved around Prussia. In\n1827\nKarl's mother Theodora died and one year later his father Wilhelm remarried. By\n1829\nWilhelm Weierstrass had become an assistant at the main tax office in Paderborn, and Karl entered the Catholic\nGymnasium\nthere. Weierstrass excelled at the Gymnasium despite having to take on a part-time job as a bookkeeper to help out the family finances.\nWhile at the Gymnasium Weierstrass certainly reached a level of mathematical competence far beyond what would have been expected. He regularly read\nCrelle\n's\nJournal\nand gave mathematical tuition to one of his brothers. However Weierstrass's father wished him to study finance and so, after graduating from the Gymnasium in\n1834\n, he entered the University of Bonn with a course planned out for him which included the study of law, finance and economics. With the career in the Prussian administration that was planned for him by his father, this was indeed a well designed course. However, Weierstrass suffered from the conflict of either obeying his father's wishes or studying the subject he loved, namely mathematics.\nThe result of the conflict which went on inside Weierstrass was that he did not attend either the mathematics lectures or the lectures of his planned course. He reacted to the conflict inside him by pretending that he did not care about his studies, and he spent four years of intensive fencing and drinking. As Biermann writes in\n[\n1\n]\n:-\n... the conflict between duty and inclination led to physical and mental strain. He tried, in vain, to overcome his problems by participating in carefree student life ...\nHe did study mathematics on his own, however, reading\nLaplace\n's\nMÃ©canique cÃ©leste\nâ\n(\nCelestial mechanics\n)\nand then a work by\nJacobi\non\nelliptic functions\n. He came to understand the necessary methods in elliptic function theory by studying transcripts of lectures by\nGudermann\n. In a letter to\nLie\n, written nearly\n50\nyears later, he explained how he came to make the definite decision to study mathematics despite his father's wishes around this time\n(\nsee\n[\n1\n]\n)\n:-\n... when I became aware of\n[\na letter from\nAbel\nto\nLegendre\n]\nin\nCrelle\n's Journal during my student years,\n[\nit\n]\nwas of the utmost importance. The immediate derivation of the form of the representation of the function given by\nAbel\n..., from the\ndifferential equation\ndefining this function, was the first mathematical task I set myself; and its fortunate solution made me determined to devote myself wholly to mathematics; I made this decision in my seventh semester ...\nWeierstrass had made a decision to become a mathematician but he was still supposed to be on a course studying public finance and administration. After his decision, he spent one further semester at the University of Bonn, his eighth semester ending in\n1838\n, and having failed to study the subjects he was enrolled for he simply left the University without taking the examinations. Weierstrass's father was desperately upset by his son giving up his studies. He was persuaded by a family friend, the president of the law courts at Paderborn, to allow Karl to study at the Theological and Philosophical Academy of MÃ¼nster so that he could take the necessary examinations to become a secondary school teacher.\nOn\n22\nMay\n1839\nWeierstrass enrolled at the Academy in MÃ¼nster.\nGudermann\nlectured in MÃ¼nster and this was the reason that Weierstrass was so keen to study there. Weierstrass attended\nGudermann\n's lectures on elliptic functions, some of the first lectures on this topic to be given, and\nGudermann\nstrongly encouraged Weierstrass in his mathematical studies. Leaving MÃ¼nster in the autumn of\n1839\n, Weierstrass studied for the teacher's examination which he registered for in March\n1840\n. By this time, however, Weierstrass's father had moved jobs yet again, becoming director of a salt works in January\n1840\n, and the family was now living in Westernkotten near Lippstadt on the Lippe River, west of Paderborn.\nAt Weierstrass's request he was given a question on the paper he received in May\n1840\non the representation of elliptic functions and he presented his own important research as an answer.\nGudermann\nassessed the paper and rated Weierstrass's contribution:-\n... of equal rank with the discoverers who were crowned with glory.\nWhen, in later life, Weierstrass learnt of\nGudermann\n's comments he said that he would have published his results had he known. Weierstrass also commented on how generous\nGudermann\nhad been in his praise, particularly since he had been highly critical of\nGudermann\n's methods.\nBy April\n1841\nWeierstrass had taken the necessary oral examinations and he began one year probation as a teacher at the Gymnasium in MÃ¼nster. Although he did not publish any mathematics at this time, he wrote three short papers in\n1841\nand\n1842\nwhich are described in\n[\n3\n]\n:-\nThe concepts on which Weierstrass based his theory of functions of a complex variable in later years after\n1857\nare found explicitly in his unpublished works written in MÃ¼nster from\n1841\nthrough\n1842\n, while still under the influence of\nGudermann\n. The transformation of his conception of an analytic function from a differentiable function to a function expansible into a convergent power series was made during this early period of Weierstrass's mathematical activity.\nWeierstrass began his career as a qualified teacher of mathematics at the Pro-Gymnasium in Deutsch Krone in West Prussia\n(\nnow Poland\n)\nin\n1842\nwhere he remained until he moved to the Collegium Hoseanum in Braunsberg in\n1848\n. As a teacher of mathematics he was required to teach other topics too, and Weierstrass taught physics, botany, geography, history, German, calligraphy and even gymnastics. In later life Weierstrass described the \"unending dreariness and boredom\" of these miserable years in which\n[\n1\n]\n:-\n... he had neither a colleague for mathematical discussions nor access to a mathematical library, and that the exchange of scientific letters was a luxury that he could not afford.\nFrom around\n1850\nWeierstrass began to suffer from attacks of dizziness which were very severe and which ended after about an hour in violent sickness. Frequent attacks over a period of about\n12\nyears made it difficult for him to work and it is thought that these problems may well have been caused by the mental conflicts he had suffered as a student, together with the stress of applying himself to mathematics in every free minute of his time while undertaking the demanding teaching job.\nIt is not surprising that when Weierstrass published papers on\nabelian functions\nin the Braunsberg school prospectus they went unnoticed by mathematicians. However, in\n1854\nhe published\nZur Theorie der Abelschen Functionen\nâ\n(\nOn the theory of abelian functions\n)\nin\nCrelle's Journal\nand this was certainly noticed. This paper did not give the full theory of inversion of hyperelliptic integrals that Weierstrass had developed but rather gave a preliminary description of his methods involving representing abelian functions as constantly converging power series.\nWith this paper Weierstrass burst from obscurity. The University of KÃ¶nigsberg conferred an honorary doctor's degree on him on\n31\nMarch\n1854\n. In\n1855\nWeierstrass applied for the chair at the University of Breslau left vacant when\nKummer\nmoved to Berlin.\nKummer\n, however, tried to influence things so that Weierstrass would go to Berlin, not Breslau, so Weierstrass was not appointed. A letter from\nDirichlet\nto the Prussian Minister of Culture written in\n1855\nstrongly supported Weierstrass being given a university appointment. Details are given in\n[\n10\n]\n.\nAfter being promoted to senior lecturer at Braunsberg, Weierstrass obtained a year's leave of absence to devote himself to advanced mathematical study. He had already decided, however, that he would never return to school teaching.\nWeierstrass published a full version of his theory of inversion of hyperelliptic integrals in his next paper\nTheorie der Abelschen Functionen\nâ\n(\nTheory of abelian functions\n)\nin\nCrelle's Journal\nin\n1856\n. There was a move from a number of universities to offer him a chair. While universities in Austria were discussing the prospect, an offer of a chair came from the Industry Institute in Berlin\n(\nlater the Technische Hochschule\n)\n. Although he would have prefered to go to the University of Berlin, Weierstrass certainly did not want to return to the Collegium Hoseanum in Braunsberg so he accepted the offer from the Institute on\n14\nJune\n1856\n.\nOffers continued to be made to Weierstrass so that when he attended a conference in Vienna in September\n1856\nhe was offered a chair at any Austrian university of his choice. Before he had decided what to do about this offer, the University of Berlin offered him a professorship in October. This was the job he had long wanted and he accepted quickly, although having accepted the offer from the Industry Institute earlier in the year he was not able to formally occupy the University of Berlin chair for some years.\nWeierstrass's successful lectures in mathematics attracted students from all over the world. The topics of his lectures included:- the application of\nFourier series\nand integrals to mathematical physics\n(1856\n/\n57)\n, an introduction to the theory of analytic functions\n(\nwhere he set out results he had obtained in\n1841\nbut never published\n)\n, the theory of elliptic functions\n(\nhis main research topic\n)\n, and applications to problems in geometry and mechanics.\nIn his lectures of\n1859\n/\n60\nWeierstrass gave\nIntroduction to analysis\nwhere he tackled the foundations of the subject for the first time. In\n1860\n/\n61\nhe lectured on the\nIntegral calculus\n.\nWe described above the health problems that Weierstrass suffered from\n1850\nonwards. Although he had achieved the positions that he had dreamed of, his health gave out in December\n1861\nwhen he collapsed completely. It took him about a year to recover sufficiently to lecture again and he was never to regain his health completely. From this time on he lectured sitting down while a student wrote on the blackboard for him. The attacks that he had suffered from\n1850\nstopped and were replaced by chest problems.\nIn his\n1863\n/\n64\ncourse on\nThe general theory of analytic functions\nWeierstrass began to formulate his theory of the real numbers. In his\n1863\nlectures he proved that the complex numbers are the only commutative algebraic extension of the real numbers.\nGauss\nhad promised a proof of this in\n1831\nbut had failed to give one.\nIn\n1872\nhis emphasis on rigour led him to discover a function that, although continuous, had no derivative at any point. Analysts who depended heavily upon intuition for their discoveries were rather dismayed at this counter-intuitive function.\nRiemann\nhad suggested in\n1861\nthat such a function could be found, but his example failed to be non-differentiable at all points.\nWeierstrass's lectures developed into a four-semester course which he continued to give until\n1890\n. The four courses were\nIntroduction to the theory of analytic functions,\nElliptic functions,\nAbelian functions,\nCalculus of variations\nor applications of elliptic functions.\nThrough the years the courses developed and a number of versions have been published such as the notes by\nKilling\nmade in\n1868\nand those by\nHurwitz\nfrom\n1878\n. Weierstrass's approach still dominates teaching analysis today and this is clearly seen from the contents and style of these lectures, particularly the\nIntroduction\ncourse. Its contents were: numbers, the function concept with Weierstrass's power series approach, continuity and differentiability, analytic continuation, points of singularity, analytic functions of several variables, in particular Weierstrass's \"preparation theorem\", and contour integrals.\nAt Berlin, Weierstrass had two colleagues\nKummer\nand\nKronecker\nand together the three gave Berlin a reputation as the leading university at which to study mathematics.\nKronecker\nwas a close friend of Weierstrass's for many years but in\n1877\nKronecker\n's opposition to\nCantor\n's work cause a rift between the two men. This became so bad that at one stage, in\n1885\n, Weierstrass decided to leave Berlin and go to Switzerland. However, he changed his mind and remained in Berlin.\nA large number of students benefited from Weierstrass's teaching. We name a few who are mentioned elsewhere in our archive:\nBachmann\n,\nBolza\n,\nCantor\n,\nEngel\n,\nFrobenius\n,\nGegenbauer\n,\nHensel\n,\nHÃ¶lder\n,\nHurwitz\n,\nKilling\n,\nKlein\n,\nKneser\n,\nKÃ¶nigsberger\n,\nLerch\n,\nLie\n,\nLÃ¼roth\n,\nMertens\n,\nMinkowski\n,\nMittag-Leffler\n,\nNetto\n,\nSchottky\n,\nSchwarz\nand\nStolz\n. One student in particular, however, deserves special mention.\nIn\n1870\nSofia Kovalevskaya\ncame to Berlin and Weierstrass taught her privately since she was not allowed admission to the university. Clearly she was a very special student as far as Weierstrass was concerned for he wrote to her that he:-\n... dreamed and been enraptured of so many riddles that remain for us to solve, on finite and infinite spaces, on the stability of the world system, and on all the other major problems of the mathematics and the physics of the future. ... you have been close ...throughout my entire life ... and never have I found anyone who could bring me such understanding of the highest aims of science and such joyful accord with my intentions and basic principles as you.\nIt was through Weierstrass's efforts that\nKovalevskaya\nreceived an honorary doctorate from GÃ¶ttingen, and he also used his influence to help her obtain the post in Stockholm in\n1883\n. Weierstrass and\nKovalevskaya\ncorresponded for\n20\nyears between\n1871\nto\n1890\n. More than\n160\nletters were exchanged\n(\nsee\n[\n5\n]\n,\n[\n7\n]\netc.\n)\n, but Weierstrass burnt\nKovalevskaya\n's letters after her death.\nThe standards of rigour that Weierstrass set, defining, for example,\nirrational\nnumbers as limits of convergent series, strongly affected the future of mathematics. He also studied\nentire functions\n, the notion of uniform convergence and functions defined by infinite products. His effort are summed up in\n[\n2\n]\nas follows:-\nKnown as the father of modern analysis, Weierstrass devised tests for the convergence of series and contributed to the theory of periodic functions, functions of real variables, elliptic functions, Abelian functions, converging infinite products, and the calculus of variations. He also advanced the theory of bilinear and\nquadratic forms\n.\nWeierstrass published little\n[\n1\n]\n:-\n... because his critical sense invariably compelled him to base any analysis on a firm foundation, starting from a fresh approach and continually revising and expanding.\nHowever, he did edit the complete works of\nSteiner\nand those of\nJacobi\n. He decided to supervise the publication of his own complete works, in his case this would involve a great deal of unpublished material from his lecture courses and Weierstrass realised that without his help this would be a difficult task. The first two volumes appeared in\n1894\nand\n1895\n, being the only ones to appear before his death in\n1897\n. His last years were difficult\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nDuring his last three years he was confined to a wheelchair, immobile and dependent. He died of pneumonia.\nThe remaining volumes of his\nComplete Works\nappeared slowly; volume\n3\nin\n1903\n, volume\n4\nin\n1902\n, volumes\n5\nand\n6\nin\n1915\n, and volume\n7\nin\n1927\n. The seven volumes were reprinted in\n1967\n. More work continues to be published today, particularly versions of his lecture courses taken from the notes made by those who attended the lectures.",
