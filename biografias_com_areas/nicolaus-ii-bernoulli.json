  "biografia": "Nicolaus\n(\nII\n)\nBernoulli\nwas the favourite of three sons of\nJohann Bernoulli\n. He entered the University of Basel when only\n13\nyears of age and, like many other members of his family, studied both mathematics and law. In\n1715\nhe became a licentiate in jurisprudence.\nYou can see the Bernoulli family tree at\nTHIS LINK\nNicolaus worked as his father's assistant helping him with correspondence. In particular he was involved with writing letters concerning the famous priority dispute between\nNewton\nand\nLeibniz\n. He not only replied to\nTaylor\nregarding the dispute but he also made important mathematical contributions to the problem of trajectories while working on the mathematical arguments behind the dispute.\nNicolaus worked on curves,\ndifferential equations\nand\nprobability\n. He died only\n8\nmonths after taking up an appointment in St Petersburg at a young age when his talents promised so much for the future. Fleckstein writes in\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nWith his brother\nDaniel\nhe travelled in France and Italy, where both received appointments to the\nSt Petersburg Academy\n. Within a year, however, he contracted and died of a hectic fever.",
