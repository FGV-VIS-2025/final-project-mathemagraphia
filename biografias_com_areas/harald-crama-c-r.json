  "biografia": "Harald CramÃ©r\nentered the University of Stockholm in\n1912\n. He embarked on a course of study which involved both chemistry and mathematics and at first the chemistry seemed to be at least as important to him as the mathematics. In fact he worked as a research assistant on a biochemistry project before becoming firmly settled on research in mathematics. CramÃ©r's first five publications are written jointly with the chemist H von Euler during\n1913\n-\n14\n. After this he worked on his doctoral studies in mathematics which were supervised by\nMarcel Riesz\n. Also influenced by\nG H Hardy\n, CramÃ©r's research resulted in the award of a PhD in\n1917\nfor his thesis\nOn a class of\nDirichlet\nseries\n.\nIn\n1919\nCramÃ©r was appointed assistant professor at the University of Stockholm. He began to produce a series of papers on\nanalytic number theory\n, and he addressed the Scandinavian Congress of Mathematicians in\n1922\non\nContributions to the analytic theory of numbers\ndetailing his work on the topic up to that time. One interesting paper by CramÃ©r over this period which we should note is one he published in\n1920\ndiscussing prime number solutions\nx\n,\ny\nx, y\nx\n,\ny\nto the equation\na\nx\n+\nb\ny\n=\nc\nax + by = c\na\nx\n+\nb\ny\n=\nc\n, where\na\n,\nb\n,\nc\na, b, c\na\n,\nb\n,\nc\nare fixed integers. Note that if\na\n=\nb\n=\n1\na = b = 1\na\n=\nb\n=\n1\nthen the question of whether this equation has a solution for all\nc\nc\nc\nis\nGoldbach's conjecture\n, while if\na\n=\n1\n,\nb\n=\nâ\n1\n,\nc\n=\n2\na = 1, b = -1, c = 2\na\n=\n1\n,\nb\n=\nâ\n1\n,\nc\n=\n2\n, then the question about prime solutions to\nx\n=\ny\n+\n2\nx = y + 2\nx\n=\ny\n+\n2\nis the\ntwin prime conjecture\n. CramÃ©r's work in prime numbers is put into the context of the history of prime number theory from\nEratosthenes\nto the mid\n1990\ns in\n[\n4\n]\n.\nIt was not only through his work on\nnumber theory\nthat CramÃ©r was led towards\nprobability theory\n. He also had a second job, namely as an actuary with the Svenska Life Assurance Company. This led him to study probability and statistics which then became the main area of his research. In\n1927\nhe published an elementary text in Swedish\nProbability theory and some of its applications\n. In\n1929\nhe was appointed to a newly created chair in Stockholm, becoming the first Swedish professor of Actuarial Mathematics and Mathematical Statistics.\nCramÃ©r became interested in the rigorous mathematical formulation of probability in work of the French and Russian mathematicians such as\nPaul LÃ©vy\n,\nSergei Bernstein\n, and\nAleksandr Khinchin\nin the early\n1930\ns, but in particular the axiomatic approach of\nKolmogorov\n. The results of his studies were written up in his Cambridge publication\nRandom variables and probability distributions\nwhich appeared in\n1937\n. This was to lead to later work on stationary stochastic processes. By the mid\n1930\ns CramÃ©r's attention had turned to look at the approach of the English and American statisticians such as\nFisher\n,\nNeyman\nand Egon Pearson\n(\nKarl Pearson\n's son\n)\n. These he described as admirable but\n[\n10\n]\n:-\n... not quite satisfactory from the point of view of mathematical rigour.\nMasani in\n[\n9\n]\ndescribes the beginnings of CramÃ©r's work on stochastic processes as follows:-\nThe first phase, beginning at the start of World War II, is devoted to extending the\n1934\nresults of\nKhinchin\non univariate stationary stochastic processes to multivariate stationary stochastic processes, and to studying the connections between\nKhinchin\n's work and the earlier cognate work on generalised\nharmonic analysis\nby\nNorbert Wiener\n[\nin\n]\n1930\n.\nDuring World War II CramÃ©r was to some extent cut off from the rest of the academic world. However he gave shelter to W\nFeller\nwho was forced out of Germany by Hitler's anti-Jewish policies in\n1934\n. By the end of World War II CramÃ©r had written his masterpiece\nMathematical Methods of Statistics\n. The book was first published in\n1945\n, and republished as recently as\n1999\n. The book combines the two approaches to statistics described above and the latest reprinting is described as follows:-\nIn this classic of statistical mathematical theory, Harald CramÃ©r joins the two major lines of development in the field: while British and American statisticians were developing the science of statistical inference, French and Russian probabilists transformed the classical calculus of probability into a rigorous and pure mathematical theory. The result of CramÃ©r's work is a masterly exposition of the mathematical methods of modern statistics that set the standard that others have since sought to follow.\nIn\n1950\nCramÃ©r became the President of Stockholm University. Despite holding this post until he retired in\n1961\n, CramÃ©r still found time to undertake research despite the large administrative burden placed on him. The second phase of CramÃ©r's work on stochastic processes\n[\n9\n]\n:-\n... began around\n1950\nand lasted until the early\n1980\ns...\n[\nIt\n]\nis devoted to the analysis of non-stationary processes, specifically to determining the extent to which the representations available for stationary process survive for non-stationary ones.\nCramÃ©r's\nCollected Works\nwere published in\n1994\n. Paul Embrechts, in his review of the two volumes, writes:-\nOne finds treated such fields as number theory, function theory, mathematical statistics, probability and stochastic processes, demography, insurance risk theory,\nfunctional analysis\nand the history of mathematics. Such highlights as the probabilistic method in the study of asymptotic properties of prime numbers, the spectral analysis of stationary processes, the mathematical foundation of inference and the fundamental work on risk theory all add up to a brilliant career as a scientist.\nAnother reviewer writes:-\nThis book is a classic, not least for its combination of lucidity and rigour. ... It belongs on the shelf of anyone interested in statistical methods.\nWe should give two specific results which we have not mentioned previously which will be remembered as major contributions, namely his work on the central limit theorem and his beautiful theorem that if the sum of two independent random variables is normal then all are normal.\nThere have been many tributes to CramÃ©r.\nEdward Phragmen\nwrote:-\nHarald CramÃ©r belonged to a generation of mathematicians for which it was self-evident that mathematics constitutes one of the highest forms of human thought, perhaps even the highest. For these mathematicians numbers were a necessary form of human thought, and the science of numbers was a central humanistic discipline with a cultural value of its own, completely independent of its role as auxiliary science in technical or other areas. This does not however mean that they underestimated the importance of 'using theoretical knowledge to obtain practical know-how'.\nBlom in\n[\n1\n]\nsums up CramÃ©r's contribution with simple but effective words:-\nHe was a great scientist and a good man.",
