  "biografia": "Roberto Marcolongo\nwas the son of Giovanni Marcolongo and Giuditta Borghi. His school education took place in Rome.\nMarcolongo enrolled in the degree course in mathematics at the University of Rome where he studied with\nGuiseppe Battaglini\n,\nLuigi Cremona\nand Valentino Cerruti\n(1850\n-\n1909)\n, who lectured to him in mechanics. He graduated in mathematics in\n1886\nand in\n1888\nhe became an ordinary mathematics assistant to Valentino Cerruti at the University of Rome. He published his first papers, consisting of some brief notes of algebra, in the\nJournal of Mathematics\ndirected by\nGuiseppe Battaglini\n, in\n1887\n. These are the three papers\nGeneralizzazione di un teorema sui determinanti\nâ\n(\nGeneralization of a theorem on determinants\n)\n,\nSu di un teorema di algebra elementare\nâ\n(\nOn an elementary algebra theorem\n)\n, and\nSull' analisi indetermina di\n2\nÂ° grado. Nota IÂ°\nâ\n(\nOn second degree indeterminerm analysis. Note I\n)\n.\nFor a list of papers and books by Marcolongo, see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nIn\n1892\nhe was declared eligible in competitions for the position of extraordinary professor of rational mechanics at the University of Naples and of mathematical physics at Pavia but he was not ranked as the top candidate. In November\n1895\nhe was ranked first in a competition for an extraordinary professorship of rational mechanics at the University of Messina. Marcolongo then began applying for chairs so, in\n1897\n, entered competitions for the chair of rational mechanics at the University of Padua and the chair of higher mathematics at the University of Turin. In both of these competitions his main opponent was\nTullio Levi-Civita\nwho was eleven years younger than Marcolongo. These competitions proved somewhat awkward with Marcolongo being declared the winner of both of these despite having received two votes less that\nLevi-Civita\n. The Ministry of Education, which had to make the final decisions based on the advice from the judging panels, offered Marcolongo the Padua chair but he turned it down. It was then offered to\nLevi-Civita\n, who accepted. The Ministry offered to confirm Marcolongo as extraordinary professor of rational mechanics at Messina, so he remained there. They also decided to leave the chair at the University of Turin vacant.\nIn\n1899\n, after receiving the opinion of a commission composed of\nVito Volterra\n,\nGiacinto Morera\nand Carlo Somigliana\n(1860\n-\n1955)\n, Marcolongo was promoted to the chair of rational mechanics at Messina. In December\n1907\nhe moved to Naples, where he succeeded\nFrancesco Siacci\nwhen appointed to the chair of rational mechanics.\nSiacci\nhad died in May\n1907\nleaving the chair vacant. Marcolongo would have liked to return to his home city of Rome and in\n1909\nhe applied for a position there but he was unsuccessful. He continued to  hold the chair of rational mechanics at Naples until his retirement in October\n1935\n. Marcolongo married Maria Santi and their son Fernando Marcolongo was born in Messina on\n28\nAugust\n1905\n. Fernando Marcolongo became a medical researcher with an impressive list of over\n70\ntop quality publications. Another son, Aldo Marcolongo, was born in Messina on\n14\nJanuary\n1904\nand he became a chemist.\nRoberto Marcolongo became a corresponding member of the\nAccademia Nazionale dei Lincei\nin\n1912\nand a full member in\n1921\n. In\n1924\n, at the suggestion of Giovanni Gentile\n(1875\n-\n1944)\n, he was awarded the Ordine della Corona d'Italia.\nFor the rest of this biography we follow reasonably closely a translation of\n[\n4\n]\nadding extra material.\nMarcolongo was among the Italian mathematical physicists who accepted the theory of relativity. His mathematical research concerns the theory of elasticity, the kinematics of rigid bodies and, most of all, the vector calculus, given that\n[\n3\n]\n:-\n... his attitude led him especially towards the analytical algorithmic part.\nAt the Fourth International Congress of Mathematicians held in Rome in April\n1908\nhe delivered a paper on\nL'unificazione delle teorie vettoriali\nâ\n(\nThe unification of vector theories\n)\n, a research program derived from the geometric calculus of Giuseppe Peano and developed in the following years in a series of articles and monographs written in collaboration with\nCesare Burali-Forti\n(\nof whom he later published the obituary\n[\n7\n]\nin the\nBollettino dell'Unione matematica italiana\nâ\n(\nBulletin of the Italian Mathematical Union\n)\n)\n.\nFor a list of Marcolongo's publications, including those referred to on the vector calculus, see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nFor reviews of some books by Marcolongo, in particular two works written in collaboration with\nCesare Burali-Forti\non vector calculus, see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nIn fact Marcolongo established a lengthy and fruitful collaboration with\nCesare Burali-Forti\nand they were jokingly baptised by their colleagues as the \"vector binomial.\" Their\nElementi di calcolo vettoriale con numerose applicazioni alla geometria, alla meccanica e alla fisica matematica\nâ\n(\nElements of vector calculation with numerous applications to geometry, mechanics and mathematical physics\n)\n(\nBologna\n1909\n, French translation, Paris\n1910\n,\n2\nnd ed., Bologna\n1921\n,\n3\nrd ed., Milan\n1925)\npresented the fundamentals and notation of a so-called minimum system and gave applications to the mechanics of continuous geometry and differential geometry on a surface. The\nAnalysis vectorielle gÃ©nÃ©rale\nâ\n(\nGeneral vector analysis\n)\n(\ntwo volumes published in Pavia,\n1912\n-\n13)\n, on which Marcolongo collaborated with\nMatteo Bottasso\nand\nCesare Burali-Forti\n, introduces and shows the possibilities of applying vector homographies, a type of linear transformation between vectors, which constitutes an alternative to the vector calculus of other authors, such as\nJ Willard Gibbs\n. A second edition of the first volume of this work, entitled\nTrasformazioni lineari\nâ\n(\nLinear transformations\n)\n(\nBologna\n1929)\n, was published in a encyclopaedia of vector analysis written in collaboration with Pietro Burgatti and\nTommaso Boggio\n, two other members of the so-called school of Italian vectorists. The methods of vector calculus gradually won the favour of the scholars, and their use spread in the universities in Italy and abroad. There was however no lack of discussions and criticism, above all on the part of the British and American quaternionists and the disciples of\nJ Willard Gibbs\n.\nMarcolongo also had a strong interest in the history of science and technology. Already in\nElementi di calcolo vettoriale con numerose applicazioni alla geometria, alla meccanica ed alla fisica matematica\nâ\n(\nElements of vector calculation with numerous applications to geometry, mechanics and mathematical physics\n)\n, published by Zanichelli in Bologna in\n1909\n, the mathematics was accompanied by in-depth notes on the history of the vector calculus; later he specialised in the history of mechanics, with particular attention to the Italian author,\nGalileo Galilei\nand, above all, to the drawings and manuscripts of\nLeonardo da Vinci\n. Among his monographs in this field:\nIl problema dei tre corpi da Newton\n(1686)\nal nostri giorni\nâ\n(\nThe three-body problem from Newton\n(1686)\nto the present day\n)\n(\nPisa\n1915\n, other editions Naples\n1915\n, Milan\n1918\n, Bologna\n1919)\n, and\nLeonardo da Vinci, artista-scienziato\nâ\n(\nLeonardo da Vinci, artist-scientist\n)\n(\nUlrico Hoepli, Milan,\n1939\n;\n2\nnd ed., Ulrico Hoepli, Milan,\n1943)\nwhich is the synthesis of many previous works. In fact in Marcolongo's publication list there are\n24\npapers relating to\nLeonardo da Vinci\nwhich he published before the book appeared in\n1939\n.\nMarcolongo also distinguished himself for his contribution to the dissemination of scientific culture in Italy, which over the years became increasingly central to his work. First of all, he made a considerable effort to maintain the rich Italian tradition in classical mechanics and at the same time worked hard to promote knowledge of the new physical theories. Examples of these efforts are his inaugural lecture at the University of Messina on \"Modern theories of mathematical physics\"\n(1903)\n, a contribution to the Fifth International Congress of Philosophy\n(\nNaples\n1925)\nentitled \"Between relativists and anti-relativists\" and especially his book\nRelativitÃ\nâ\n(\nRelativity\n)\n(\nG Principato, Messina,\n1921)\n. Giulio Maltese writes\n[\n6\n]\n:-\nIn\n1906\nMarcolongo demonstrated the existence of scalar and vector potentials and defined\nLorentz\n's transformation as the one that left\nMaxwell\n's equations unaltered, and in\n1913\nhe studied the transformation laws of various quantities occurring in special relativity.\nLorentz\n,\nMinkowski\n, and\nPoincarÃ©\nwere the authors he cited most frequently;\nEinstein\n's name never appeared. ... Marcolongo's main purpose was therefore to demonstrate the power of his mathematical methods. He reported his advances in vectorial formalism to\nLevi-Civita\n, who used them in his papers on the asymptotic of electric radiations.\nThe above quote mentions that Marcolongo informed\nLevi-Civita\nabout his advances and we note that he did this in letters he wrote to\nLevi-Civita\non\n1\nAugust\n1904\n,\n13\nMarch\n1905\n,\n12\nNovember\n1905\n,\n22\nMarch\n1906\n, and\n25\nApril\n1912\n.\nTwo texts on university teaching in Marcolongo's publication list stand out as being particularly influential. These, like the two historical monographs mentioned above, were published in the particularly important series of Hoepli Manuals. They are:\nTeoria matematica dell'equilibrio dei corpi elastici\nâ\n(\nMathematical theory of the equilibrium of elastic bodies\n)\n(\nUlrico Hoepli, Milan,\n1904)\nand\nMeccanica razionale\nâ\n(\nRational mechanics\n)\n(2\nvolumes, Ulrico Hoepli, Milan,\n1905)\n, which was translated into German as\nTheoretische Mechanik\nâ\n(\nTheoretical mechanics\n)\n(\nB G Teubner, Leipzig,\n1911)\n.\nInterest by Marcolongo in secondary education, especially for technical and vocational schools, is already evident in his\nRelazione sull'ordinamento dei programmi della Scuola d'arti e mestieri di Messina\nâ\n(\nReport on the organization of programs of the School of Arts and Crafts of Messina\n)\n(\nMessina,\n1902)\n. From the\n1920\ns he also published highly regarded mathematical textbooks for secondary schools:\n(\nwith\nCesare Burali-Forti\n)\nCorso di matematica pel\n2\nÂ° biennio degli istituti tecnici\nâ\n(\nMathematics course for the second year of technical institutes\n)\n(\nNaples,\n1920)\n;\nAlgebra pei licei scientifici\nâ\n(\nAlgebra for scientific high schools\n)\n(\nNaples,\n1923)\n;\nElementi di trigonometria ad uso degli istituti medi superiori e degli istituti industriali\nâ\n(\nElements of trigonometry for use by upper secondary schools and industrial institutes\n)\n(\nRome,\n1929)\n;\nComplementi di algebra e di analisi per i licei scientifici\nâ\n(\nComplements of algebra and analysis for scientific high schools\n)\n(\nRome,\n1930)\n; and\n(\nwith L Marzella\n)\nCorso di matematica ad uso degli istituti tecnici commerciali e per geometri\nâ\n(\nMathematics course for use in commercial technical institutes and surveyors\n)\n(\nRome,\n1938)\n. Since the\n1920\ns he also carried out a large body of work, widely used in mathematics and in the history of science, as a collaborator on the\nItalian Encyclopaedia\n. In addition he had numerous articles published in the journals\nSapere\nâ\n(\nKnowing\n)\nand\nScientia\nâ\n(\nScientia\n)\n. For example in\nSapere\nhe published articles such as\nLe curve di Lissajous e le curve giroscopiche\nâ\n(\nLissajous curves and gyroscopic curves\n)\nin\n1936\n,\nLeonardo nel \"paradiso delle scienze matematiche\", Fisico, matematico, astronomo\nâ\n(\nLeonardo on the 'Paradise of mathematical sciences', Physicist, mathematician, astronomer\n)\nin\n1938\n, and\nLe nuove scienze, la meccanica del secol novo\nâ\n(\nNew sciences, the mechanics of the new year\n)\nin\n1942\n. In\nScientia, Rivista di Scienza\nâ\n(\nScientia, report of science\n)\nhe published numerous reviews of books such as A D'Abro's book\nThe evolution of Scientific thought from Newton to Einstein\nwhich he reviewed in\n1931\nand\nTullio Levi-Civita\n's book\nFondamenti di Meccanica Relativistica\nâ\n(\nFoundations of relativistic mechanics\n)\nwhich he reviewed in\n1932\n. Also in\nScientia\nhe published\nLa relativitÃ  ristretta\nâ\n(\nSpecial relativity\n)\nin two parts, both published in\n1924\n.\nMarcolongo found himself involved in bitter controversies derived from scientific and academic rivalries that featured Italian vectorialists. His position, however, was, in his words, \"less rigid and more eclectic\" and therefore more open to connection with the trends of international scientific culture. Regarding the purist criteria, radically hostile to the use of the Burali-Forti coordinates, he had a more conciliatory attitude; he did not share the position decidedly contrary to the theory of relativity of Burali-Forti and Boggio, and not even the criticisms that these two mathematicians put forward against the absolute differential calculus of\nLevi-Civita\nand\nG Ricci-Curbastro\n. In fact the close cooperation between Marcolongo and Burali-Forti only ran into difficulties over\nBurali-Forti\n's attack on\nEinstein\n's theory of relativity in his paper\nEspaces courbes. Critique de la relativitÃ©\nâ\n(\nCurved spaces. Criticism of relativity\n)\n(1924)\n. Marcolongo wrote that this was\n[\n7\n]\n:-\n... the only time when the peace and solidity of the vector binomial\n[\nBurali-Forti\nand Marcolongo\n]\nseemed to be compromised... . It was not possible for them to agree, first on the new range to be given to vector methods; then, even more deeply, on the essence of the whole theory. Despite the interest he\n[\nBurali-Forti\n]\nfelt for all the modern physical questions and above all for those of high and absorbing philosophical interest, he remained firmly obedient to the classic systems and in attack as in defence he could not remain calm and objective.\nIn October\n1932\n, Marcolongo enrolled in the National Fascist Party. This party had been founded by Benito Mussolini in\n1921\nand by the time Marcolongo joined it was the only political party allowed in Italy. On\n27\nMay\n1933\n, membership of the National Fascist Party was declared a basic requirement for public office. In the following years, which saw the devastation of the Italian scientific community following the promulgation of the racial laws, he participated in two important cultural initiatives. As a member of the Royal Vinciana Commission, he participated in the organization of the\nMostra di Leonardo e delle invenzioni italiane\nâ\n(\nExhibition on Leonardo and Italian Inventions\n)\nheld in the Palazzo dell'Arte\n(\nnow the Triennale\n)\nin Milan from\n9\nMay\n1939\nto\n1\nOctober\n1939\n. A quote from the exhibition catalogue shows the political nature of this event:-\nThe purpose of the exhibition is to celebrate the universal and unequalled genius of\nLeonardo da Vinci\n, assumed as practically the symbol of all Latin and Christian, and therefore Roman, civilization, and to highlight the spiritual connections uniting this great man of accomplishments and creator with the realizations of Mussolinian and Imperial Italy. The combining of the Vincian celebrations with the exhibition of Italian inventions tends to demonstrate the continuity of the creative genius of the race and the great possibilities opening up to those within the climate of Fascist will.\nIn December\n1939\nhe became a member of the sub-committee for mathematics of the Science Exhibition in the context of the works for the Esposizione universale\nâ\n(\nWorld's Fair\n)\nof Rome in\n1942\n. The committee undertook to identify the so-called Italian contribution to the mathematical sciences, thus removing the names of Italian Jewish mathematicians, including\nLevi-Civita\nhimself. The exhibition never took place because of World War II.\nIn April\n1942\nMarcolongo was appointed to the Reale Accademia d'Italia. This academy, which only operated between\n1929\nand\n1944\n, was founded by Mussolini with the aim of:-\n... promoting and coordinating the Italian intellectual movement in the field of science, literature and the arts, to keep the national character pure, according to the genius and traditions of the race and to favour its expansion and influence beyond boundaries of the State.\nAfter being appointed professor emeritus in\n1937\n, Marcolongo returned to Rome, the city of his birth, where he died on\n16\nMay\n1943\n. He therefore died before the Allies invaded Sicily in July\n1943\nand mainland Italy in September\n1943\n. We note that Marcolongo's son, Fernando, was an extraordinary professor of medical pathology at the University of Catania when the Allies invaded Sicily, but he survived the war.",
