  "biografia": "L Wayland Dowling\nwas the son of Philip Henry Dowling\n(1834\n-\n1919)\nand Diana T Luther\n(1842\n-\n1903)\n. Philip Henry Dowling had been born in Marston Biggott, Somerset, England on\n27\nOctober\n1834\nto farming parents. Moving to the United States, he had attended Adrian College, Lenawee, Michigan from the time the college opened in\n1859\nand graduated in Civil Engineering in\n1863\n. During his time at the college the Civil War had broken out and many soldiers were being trained there. After leaving Adrian College, Philip became a farmer owning a small strip of land south of Rome, Lenawee, Michigan. His farm had\n10\nacres of farm land and\n10\nacres of woodland. Philip Dowling married Diana T Luther in Rome, Lenawee, Michigan on\n5\nAugust\n1863\n. Diana had been born in Rome, Lenawee on\n16\nJune\n1842\ninto a farming family. Philip and Diana Dowling had four children: Linnaeus Wayland Dowling\n(1867\n-\n1928)\n, the subject of this biography, Herschel Ray Dowling\n(1871\n-\n1956)\n, Henrietta Amelia Dowling\n(1874\n-\n1917)\n, known as  Millie, and Theodora Luther Dowling\n(1879\n-\n1947)\n, known as Dora.\nWith a Civil Engineering qualification, Philip Dowling was able to provide his son Wayland with his early education. He received his secondary education in Rome, Lenawee, graduating in\n1885\n. Later in that year he began to teach in various schools in Southern Michigan\n[\n19\n]\n:-\n... experiencing many of the hardships of the old-time country school-teacher.\nAfter four years as a school teacher, in\n1889\nDowling entered Adrian College. This was the college at which his father had studied; it was run by the Methodist Church. He graduated from the College in\n1892\nwith an A.M. and later that year began graduate studies in mathematics at Clark University. This university had been founded in Worcester, Massachusetts, in\n1887\nby the businessman Jonas Gilman Clark as a graduate institution. It was the first graduate only university in the United States and only had five departments, mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, and psychology. It continued as a graduate only institution until\n1902\nwhen the first undergraduates began studying there.\nClark University hired some top quality mathematicians with\nWilliam Story\n,\nOskar Bolza\nand\nHenry White\nall teaching graduate courses there by\n1890\n. A serious political situation arose at Clark University, however, and a vote of no confidence was passed in the president G Stanley Hall. Nine of the eleven members of faculty left Clark including both\nHenry White\nand\nOskar Bolza\n.\nWilliam Story\nremained at Clark despite the fact that he only had two junior colleagues to help him run the Ph.D. programme and this was the situation when Dowling began studying there in\n1892\n.\nStory\nbecame Dowling's thesis advisor.\nWhile he was a graduate student at Clark University, Dowling married Martha Eloise Johnson at Clayton, Lenawee, Michigan, on\n14\nSeptember\n1893\n. Martha, known as Mattie, was the second of four daughters of the farmers Ambrose Johnson and Elizabeth Thompson. Before her marriage she had been a highly respected school teacher in Clayton. The newly married couple went to live in Worcester, Massachusetts and soon Mattie became pregnant with their child. Around the beginning of May\n1894\n, Mattie returned home to Clayton where she would give birth to her child. The university term was nearly finished and Dowling remained in Worcester, intending to go to Clayton as soon as the vacation began. About\n7\no'clock on the morning of Monday\n28\nMay\n1894\nhe received a telegram informing him that his wife was in a dangerous condition. He left immediately for Clayton so did not receive the\n10\no'clock telegram telling him that his wife had died in child birth. Dowling\n[\n25\n]\n:-\n... was not aware of the sorrow that awaited him until he arrived at the store of his cousin, E L Luther, in this city\n[\nClayton\n]\nthis morning\n[\nTuesday,\n29\nMay\n1894]\n, when the dread news was broken to him. It was a hard sorrowful task, and his many friends have deep sympathy for him in his great and sore bereavement. Mrs Dowling was a young woman of many fine qualities, loved by all who knew her, and hundreds of earnest friends will mourn her sudden death, on the threshold of a bright and happy life.\nThe Dowlings' child was still born. Mattie Dowling's funeral was held on Thursday\n31\nMay at Clayton and she was buried in the North Dover Cemetery in Clayton.\nDowling returned to his graduate studies at Clark University and, advised by\nWilliam Edward Story\n, he wrote his Ph.D. thesis\nOn the Forms of Plane Quintic Curves\n. The thesis, dated\n1\nJune\n1895\n, contains the following Acknowledgement:-\nI wish to express my obligation to the Professors and Instructors in this University\n[\nClark University\n]\nfor uniform courtesy and assistance. I am especially indebted to Professor\nStory\n, under whose supervision the work has been carried out.\nDowling begins his thesis was a good historical survey. Here are the first few paragraphs:-\nThe study of analytical geometry, as is well known, dates back to the Renaissance.\nDescartes\npublished his 'Discours de la mÃ©thode' in\n1637\n, and this paved the way to one of the richest fields of mathematical research.\nDescartes\n' method of representing plane loci by means of algebraic equations was applied by him and his contemporaries to the various curves then known to geometers, but it was not until\n1704\nthat the method resulted in anything like a systematic treatment of plane curves. In that year appeared\nNewton\n's 'Enumeratio Tertii Ordinis'.\nNewton\n's method of classifying the curves of third order was the classic one of examining their infinite branches. By this means he succeeded in finding\n72\nvarieties, but, what is far more important, he showed that all those varieties may be derived from five by simple projection.\nMaclaurin\n,\nStirling\n,\nClairaut\n, and others followed in the footsteps of\nNewton\n. These writers cover the period between the 'Enumeratio'  of\nNewton\nand the appearance of\nPlÃ¼cker\n's 'System der analytischen Geometrie'. In this work, which was published in\n1835\n, the method of classification by infinite points reached, perhaps, its most complete development. In the hands of\nPlÃ¼cker\nthis method more than trebled the number of forms discovered by\nNewton\n, and by so doing became extremely cumbersome. But as\nCayley\npoints out in his Memoir, 'On the Classification of Cubic Curves',\nPlÃ¼cker\nmakes a distinct advance by introducing the idea of \"groups of curves\"; that is to say, singly infinite systems of curves depending upon certain definite positions of the reference loci. ...\nAfter the historical introduction, Dowling describes his own contributions as follows:-\nIn the present work I propose to study the possible forms of quintic curves from a somewhat new point of view, and I shall content myself with real points and real branches of such curves. In the first chapter will be found a number of well-known theorems in topology about the form and arrangement of the branches of plane algebraic curves. In the second chapter I have endeavoured to make a complete study of the changes in the number of real bitangents due to a change in the form of the curve. In the third chapter will be found the method of arriving at the general form to which the equation of every quintic curve can be reduced. The fourth chapter contains the definition and number of possible forms of\nk\nk\nk\n-lobate quintics. Finally in the last chapter I have indicated how the general equation may be used to study the unicursal quintic.\nAfter the award of a Ph.D., at the start of the\n1895\n-\n96\nacademic year, Dowling was appointed as an instructor in mathematics at the University of Wisconsin. In\n1898\nhe was promoted to Assistant Professor of Mathematics. When he joined the University of Wisconsin, Charles Ambrose Van Velzer\n(1851\n-\n1945)\nwas Professor of Mathematics, Charles Sumner Slichter\n(1864\n-\n1946)\nwas Professor of Applied Mathematics, Ernest Brown Skinner\n(1863\n-\n1935)\nwas Assistant Professor of Mathematics, and John M Howie\n(\nborn\n1871)\nwas an Assistant in Mathematics. We give some details of these mathematicians who became Dowling's colleagues.\nCharles Ambrose Van Velzer was born in Baldwinsville, New York, on\n2\nSeptember\n1851\n. He attended Cornell University from\n1872\nto\n1876\nwhen he graduated with a Bachelor of Science. He received first prize in mathematics at the intercollegiate contest in December of that year while he was an instructor at Cornell\n1876\n-\n1877\n. He was a graduate fellow at Johns Hopkins University\n1878\n-\n1881\nand became Instructor in Mathematics at the University of Wisconsin in\n1881\n. He was promoted to Assistant Professor in\n1883\nand to Professor in\n1885\n. The same year, Hillsdale College conferred on him an honorary doctorate. Van Velzer served as Chair of the Department of Mathematics at the University of Wisconsin\n1884\n-\n1894\nand continued as a Professor at the University of Wisconsin until\n1906\n.\nCharles Sumner Slichter was born in Saint Paul, Minnesota, on\n16\nApril\n1864\n. He attended Cornell University graduated with a Bachelor of Science in\n1885\n. He then studied at Northwestern University, being awarded a Master's Degree in\n1887\n. In\n1886\nhe went to the University of Wisconsin as an instructor in mathematics, became an assistant professor in\n1889\n, and in\n1892\nwas made Professor of Applied Mathematics. He was appointed dean of the University of Wisconsin graduate school in\n1920\nand continued to hold that position until he retired in\n1934\n.\nErnest Brown Skinner\n(1863\n-\n1935)\nwas born in Redfield, Ohio, on\n12\nDecember\n1863\n. He graduated from Ohio University in\n1888\n, taught at Amity College in Iowa\n(1888\n-\n1891)\n, then undertook research at Clark University advised by\nWilliam Story\n. In\n1892\n, before completing work for a Ph.D., he went to the University of Wisconsin as an instructor and was promoted to assistant professor in\n1895\n. He took leave for a year to undertake research for a Ph.D. at the University of Chicago which he was awarded in\n1900\n. He was promoted to associate professor in\n1910\n, and to a full professor in\n1920\n. He continued as a Professor at the University of Wisconsin until his death in\n1935\n.\nJohn M Howie\n(\nborn\n1871)\nwas an Assistant in Mathematics at the University of Nebraska\n1894\n-\n95\nbefore being appointed as an Assistant in Mathematics at the University of Wisconsin\n1895\n-\n97\n.\nOn\n12\nSeptember\n1899\n, Dowling married Jessie Sophronia Clapp\n(1872\n-\n1934)\n. Jessie Clapp had been born on\n24\nJanuary\n1872\nin Paxton, Worcester, Massachusetts to the farmer Hiram Blake Clapp and his wife Clarissa Blackman Pierce. Before her marriage to Dowling, Jessie Clapp was a school teacher in Worcester and she had met Dowling when he was studying for his doctorate at Clark University. Wayland and Jessie Dowling had a son, Phillip Herschel Dowling, born in Madison on\n13\nNovember\n1900\n. He attended schools in Madison and went on to obtain a doctorate in physics from the University of Wisconsin. He taught at Yale for three years then became a researcher at the Union Switch and Signal Laboratory in Pittsburgh\n(1927\n-\n45)\n, then worked in solid state physics at the Philips Laboratories. He died in\n1970\n.\nWayland Dowling was the thesis advisor for a number of Ph.D. students at the University of Wisconsin but we would like to mention in particular that he was advisor to two women Ph.D. students,\nCharlotte Elvira Pengra\nand\nFlorence Eliza Allen\n.\nCharlotte Pengra\nstudied for her doctorate from\n1899\nto\n1901\nand was awarded a Ph.D. for her thesis\nOn Functions Connected with Special Riemann Surfaces, In Particular Those For Which P Equals\n3\n,\n4\n, and\n5\n. The\n1901\naward makes her the third person to receive a Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin and the sixth American woman to be awarded that degree.\nFlorence E Allen\n(1876\n-\n1960)\nwas awarded a Ph.D. in\n1907\nfor her thesis\nThe Cyclic Involutions of Third Order Determined by Nets of Curves of Deficiency\n0\n,\n1\n, and\n2\n. She became the second woman and the fourth person to receive a Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin.\nWorld leading research in geometry at this time was taking place in Italy and Dowling decided to make a research visit to Turin where\nCorrado Segre\n,\nGino Fano\nand other colleagues had built a strong research school. He applied for a passport in May\n1905\ngiving the following personal description: Age,\n37\nyears; Stature,\n5\nft\n10\nins; Forehead, High; Eyes, Grey; Nose, Medium; Mouth, Medium with Moustaches; Chin, Slightly double; Hair, Dark Brown; Complexion, Fair; Face, Oval. Although heading for Italy, he set put with his wife Jessie, his son Phillip, his Ph.D. student\nFlorence Allen\nand Florence's mother Eliza Allen. Also with them was Merle Pickford and Jennie Sherrill, both graduates from the University of Wisconsin who were instructors in history at Eau Claire High School and Belvidere high school respectively. The\nWisconsin Alumni Magazine\nreported\n[\n27\n]\n:-\nA party of tourists left Madison in June\n1905\nfor a summer's trip in Europe, under the guidance of Professor L W Dowling, assistant professor of mathematics. The other members of the party are Mrs Dowling, Mrs Eliza Allen and daughter Miss\nFlorence E Allen\n,\n(1900)\n, instructor in mathematics; Miss Merle S Pickford\n(1902)\n, instructor in history in the Eau Claire High School; and Miss Jennie Sherrill\n(1902)\n, of Belvidere, Ill., instructor in history in Belvidere high school. The party travels together through England, Holland and Germany to Switzerland, where Mrs Allen and daughter will return to Bonn, Germany, to meet Mr C E Allen,\n(1899)\n, Mrs Allen's son, who, with his wife, has been in thatÂ city attending the University for the past year, engaged in the study of botany, of which he is instructor at the University. The other members of the party will proceed to Italy, where Dr and Mrs Dowling expect to remain until\n1\nJune\n1906\n. Dr Dowling will spend a year in study at Turin, Italy. Miss Pickford and Miss Sherrill will sail for home by way of Naples and the Mediterranean route,\n26\nAugust, on the steamship Canopic, White Star Line, landing at Boston. Mrs Allen and daughter and Mr Allen and wife will sail from Hamburg\n1\nSeptember reaching here before the opening of the University next fall.\nMerle Pickford informed the\nWisconsin State Journal from Madison\nwhen they arrived in England\n[\n26\n]\n:-\nPosts have been received from Miss Merle Pickford who with Dr and Mrs Dowling, Mrs Eliza Allen and daughter, Miss\nFlorence Allen\narrived safely at Liverpool after a pleasant voyage, and who presumably are now in London.\nDowling spent\n1905\n-\n06\nin Turin where he worked mainly with\nCorrado Segre\n. He, with his wife and son, returned to the United States sailing from Naples to Boston on the Canopic, arriving in\n14\nMay\n1906\n.\nIn\n1912\nDowling was a member of the student loan committee and, in that capacity, he received, from the class of\n1912\n, a memorial student loan fund to be used for needy students. You can see a report of the speech he gave on receipt of the fund at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nIn addition to writing books, he was also the editor of the Johnson Mathematical Series for the Johnson Publishing Company, Richmond. For example, in\nThe American Mathematical Monthly\n(1927)\nthere is an advertisement:-\nJohnson Mathematics Series\nL Wayland Dowling, Editor\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â\nPlane Geometry - D Meade Bernard\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â $\n1\n.\n24\n.\nTeachable, clear, and accurate both in thought and expression, with important original features.\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â\nPlane Trigonometry and Tables - Buchanan and Sperry\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â $\n1\n.\n64\n.\nStimulating, clear, and rigorous treatment, remarkable for its brevity and conciseness.\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â\nCollege Geometry - N Altshiller-Court\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â $\n4\n.\n00\n.\nA practical and useful course in modern geometry.\nJOHNSON PUBLISHING COMPANY Richmond, Virginia.\nAt the University of Wisconsin, he was successively promoted to Associate Professor and Professor of Mathematics. He wrote a number of textbooks:\nAnalytic Geometry\n(1914)\n;\nProjective Geometry\n(1917)\n; and\nMathematics of Life Insurance\n(1925)\n. Amazingly you can still buy copies of these books which are still today\n(2025)\nin print.\nFor more information about these books, see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nHe was a member of the\nAmerican Mathematical Society\n, the\nMathematical Association of America\n, and the\nCircolo Matematico di Palermo\n.\nIn\n1927\nDowling's health began to fail and he was forced to give up teaching early in the second semester of\n1927\n-\n28\n. He died at his home in Madison on Sunday\n16\nSeptember\n1928\nand after a funeral in his home, with the Rev Robbins W Barstow officiating, on Tuesday\n18\nSeptember, he was buried in Forest Hill Cemetery in Madison.\nLet us end by quoting from two tributes. First,\nFlorence Allen\nwrites\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nProfessor Dowling's instruction was characterised by an exceptional clarity of exposition which, with his magnetism, geniality of manner, and interest in his students, made him a universally popular and beloved teacher. He was a man of unusual breadth of interests: a talented musician, an eager and well-informed botanist, and a student of the humanities. His knowledge of the language and literature of Italy, where he studied under the geometer\nSegre\n, was exceptional; and he was an ardent reader and lover of poetry. These talents explain, in part, the bonds of sympathy that united him with so many colleagues and students. But above all his attraction was due to his personal qualities, his cheerful disposition and his kindly character. His influence in these private associations was no less great than in his admirable public service as a teacher, and he will long be remembered and missed by his friends.\nThe Notes and News in\nThe American Mathematical Monthly\nhas the following tribute\n[\n17\n]\n:-\nThis long service as teacher and friend has been rich in its fruitful associations. Magnetic in personality, genial of manner, peculiarly endowed with the teaching gift, he quickly won and maintained the admiration and devotion of his students. He brought to them a rare combination of discipline and vision, a mingling of carefully developed fundamentals with glimpses of the heights beyond. Many of his students who later became teachers testify to the special inspiration and help in their work received in his classroom.\nThe days of growing weakness were brightened by daily visits of friends and students, who found him, as always, full of sympathy for their interests. His home was a shrine, to which flocked the many who loved him. These found him with peace and serenity of spirit, surrounded by the things he put first, his family, his friends, and his books. Active in community life, lover of literature, music, and nature, his passing leaves a wide sense of personal loss.",
