  "biografia": "Graham Allan\nwas born in Southgate, north London. He was\n[\n1\n]\n:-\n... an only child of parents who had both left school at\n14\n.\nWhen World War II began in\n1939\n, Graham was only three years old. His father worked for the Air Ministry and soon the family were moved to the Cotswolds where they spent four years before returning to London in\n1943\n. Graham attended Minchenden Grammar School in Southgate and his outstanding mathematical achievements led to him being awarded an exhibition in mathematics to Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, at the age of eighteen. He chose to undertake military service at this stage rather than postpone it until after his university studies which was the route taken by many university students.\nFor the two years\n1955\n-\n57\nAllan served with the Royal Air Force, spending most of the time stationed in East Anglia at a radar station. These were not years in which he neglected his mathematical interests, however, rather they gave him time in which he was able to prepare himself very well for his Cambridge studies. He entered Sidney Sussex College in\n1957\n, took Part II of the Mathematical Tripos in\n1960\nand Part III in the following year. He then continued to undertake research supervised by Frank Smithies and, after being appointed as a Research Fellow, Sidney Sussex College in\n1963\n, he was awarded a Ph.D. in the following year for his thesis\nContributions to the theory of locally convex spaces\n. During his time as a research student he married Elizabeth Gemmell in\n1962\n; they had two daughters Juliet and Clare.\nAfter completing his doctorate, Allan was elected a Fellow and Director of Studies of Churchill College, Cambridge. He was three years in this position, from\n1964\nto\n1967\nand during this time he lectured to Garth Dales who writes\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nI took Graham's Part III course on\nBanach\nalgebras in the year\n1966\n-\n67\n. I was very much attracted by the beautiful clear lecturing style which covered the details carefully, but never became pedantic; he always took great care to ensure that his lectures were accessible to his audience. The material was, to me, a lovely blend of algebraic foundations with a substantial super-structure of real, complex, and functional analysis.\nIn\n1967\nhe was appointed a Lecturer in Pure Mathematics at Newcastle University. He spent only two years there before returning to Cambridge as a Lecturer in Pure Mathematics. After a year back at Cambridge he was offered a professorship in Pure Mathematics at Leeds University in\n1970\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nAt that time, there was a considerable expansion of university education in the UK, and in particular the School of Mathematics at Leeds was to expand substantially, with many new faculty appointments and far more undergraduate students. The plan for pure mathematics was striking: the department was to concentrate on just three distinct areas of research in the subject. Allan was appointed to lead and build up a group in modern mathematical analysis; he was very successful in leading the development of a new undergraduate syllabus, and in building up a strong research team.\nFrom\n1975\nto\n1978\nhe served as Head of Pure Mathematics at Leeds. Garth Dales writes\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nHowever, Allan did not welcome the increasing burden of administrative duties, coupled with the damaging financial stringency then imposed on the university, and he missed the stimulation of the very strong undergraduates and graduate students that he had had at Cambridge. He returned to Cambridge as a Lecturer in Mathematics and Fellow of Churchill in\n1978\n...\nIn order to gain further understanding of why Allan wished to return to Cambridge, we should look at this point at his leading mathematical contributions. He began publishing papers shortly after completing his doctoral studies, his first papers being naturally based on the material in his thesis. He published\nA note on B*-algebras\n(1965)\n,\nA spectral theory for locally convex algebras\n(1965)\n,\nOn a class of locally convex algebras\n(1967)\n,\nOn one-sided inverses in Banach algebras of holomorphic vector-valued functions\n(1967)\n, and\nHolomorphic vector-valued functions on a domain of holomorphy\n(1967)\n. He continued to publish two papers a year until\n1971\n, these papers making deep and significant contributions to\nBanach\nalgebras. He was invited to contribute a survey article to the\nBulletin\nof the\nLondon Mathematical Society\nand this survey\nSome aspects of the theory of commutative Banach algebras and holomorphic functions of several complex variables\nwas published in\n1971\n:-\nIn this survey article the author outlines those parts of\nholomorphic\nfunction theory\n(\nin particular, the holomorphic functional calculus\n)\nthat have been applied in the study of commutative\nBanach\nalgebras, specifically excluding topics that are peculiar to uniform algebras, where the applications have been most extensive. Most of the material has become well known during the last few years but the author does touch on some very recent results and open problems. He concludes with a good bibliography of\n71\ntitles.\nHowever, administrative duties at Leeds had a significant impact on the number of his publications. In the five years\n1972\nto\n1976\ninclusive he published four papers, one being\nSeveral complex variables and Banach algebras\nin\n1976\n:-\nThis paper is a nicely-written brief introduction to that part of the general theory of commutative\nBanach\nalgebras in which complex function theory plays a significant role. The author assumes no previous knowledge of\nBanach\nalgebra theory, but some acquaintance with the beginnings of\nfunctional analysis\nis assumed as is the general notion of a holomorphic function of several complex variables. The main object of the exposition is the construction of the holomorphic functional calculus in several variables and the application of this calculus to the Silov idempotent theorem, the local maximum modulus theorem and the Arens-Royden theorem.\nBetween\n1976\nand\n1983\nonly one of Allan's papers was published, so it become easy to understand how he wished to return to an environment where he could concentrate more on the research he loved. Having moved from a professorship to a lectureship in\n1978\n, he became a Reader in\n1980\n. In\n1985\nhe was again appointed  Director of Studies at Churchill, and then Vice-Master of the College from\n1990\nuntil\n1993\n. He retired in\n2003\n. Garth Dales writes:-\nThe work of Graham Allan was, like the man, apparently unassuming, but very influential in the international world of pure mathematics. ... His influence arose from his mathematical papers, frequently the seeds of new directions of research, from his beautifully presented and lucid lectures to undergraduates, and, perhaps most importantly, from the inspiration that he gave over his career to his research students.\nIn fact Allan had over\n20\nresearch students, including include John Rennison\n(\nKent\n)\n, Ian Craw\n(\nAberdeen\n)\n, Garth Dales\n(\nLeeds\n)\n, Peter McClure\n(\nManitoba\n)\n, Peter Dixon\n(\nSheffield\n)\n, Ghotsi Haghany\n(\nIsfahan\n)\n, Thomas Ransford\n(\nLaval\n)\n, Michael White\n(\nNewcastle\n)\n, Frederic Gourdeau\n(\nLaval\n)\nand Thomas Vils Pedersen\n(\nCopenhagen\n)\n.\nIn\n[\n1\n]\nit is noted that:-\nGraham became a Roman Catholic in\n1979\n, persuaded by intellectual considerations; he deeply loved philosophy and theology, and this was a major part of his life. ... Always Graham was kind, quiet, thoughtful, and considerate; he inspired great affection in his research students and others; he was very modest about his own achievements. His former students and many friends in the mathematical community will miss him greatly.",
