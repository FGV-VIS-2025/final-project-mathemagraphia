  "biografia": "Carol Karp\nwas born Carol Ruth van der Velde or Carol Ruth Vander Velde. Her parents were Peter Nelson Vander Velde\n(15\nDecember\n1901\n-\n8\nSeptember\n1980)\nand Janet Lucy Keizer\n(7\nJanuary\n1900\n-\n4\nNovember\n1949)\n. Peter Vander Velde, originally named Pieter van der Velde, was the son of Weybe van der Velde and Nellie Stoel. He was baptised into the Dutch Christian Reformed Church on\n10\nApril\n1902\n, becoming a member on\n11\nJune\n1906\n. He married Janet Keizer in Ottawa, Kent, Michigan on\n24\nJune\n1925\n. Janet Keizer had been born in Forest Grove, Ottawa County, Michigan, the daughter of Cyrus Keizer and Renzena Strick. Peter Vander Velde was a fertiliser salesman at the time of the\n1930\ncensus living in Jamestown, Ottawa County, Michigan, and manager of Sunshine Stores, a feed and grain store in Alliance, Stark, Ohio, at the time of the\n1940\ncensus\n[\n4\n]\n:-\nBoth of\n[\nCarol's\n]\nparents had strong family ties to the conservative and devout Dutch farmingÂ community centred around Holland, Michigan.\nCarol had a brother Wallace Earl Vander Velde\n(\nborn in\n1929)\n. He was awarded B.Sc. in aero engineering from Purdue University in\n1951\n, and a Ph.D. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in\n1956\nfor his thesis\nA Nonlinear Method of Automatic Control in the Presence of Random Noise\n. He joined the faculty of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in\n1957\nbecoming professor of aeronautics and astronautics there in\n1965\n. He died on\n16\nMay\n2019\n. Carol also had a brother Myron Dale Vander Velde\n(\nborn\n11\nMarch\n1939)\n, known as Mike, who was awarded a degree in electrical engineering from Michigan State University in\n1966\n. He became the manager of a computer centre and died on\n6\nAugust\n2000\nin Newport, Cocke County, Tennessee.\nHaving given some information about Carol's parents and her brothers, let us return to her biography. The family lived in Forest Grove for the first eleven years of her life and she attended a small school with only three rooms, each room having pupils from four of five different grades. When she was eleven, the family moved to Alliance, Ohio, where Carol attended Alliance High School. Home life, however, was rather restricted as she was growing up\n[\n4\n]\n:-\nEven away from the Dutch community in Michigan,\n[\nCarol's\n]\nteenage activities were subject to the severe restrictionsÂ of the Dutch Reformed Church: dancing and movie-going were strictly forbidden, and card-playing was frowned upon.\nWe can see that Carol was a very successful student at Alliance High School from information in\nRed and Blue\n, the Alliance High School student newspaper. Her name appears in\n31\nof the\nRed and Blue\nnewspapers between\n1942\nand\n1944\n, see\n[\n9\n]\n. We learn that, among other things, she became an officer of the Latin Club\n(6\nMarch\n1942)\n, entered the Columbus instruments contest\n(24\nApril\n1942)\n, served as Program Chairman of the Latin Club\n(22\nMay\n1942)\n, became a new member of the Fine Arts Club\n(9\nOctober\n1942)\n, became a new member of the Blue Domino Club\n(12\nMarch\n1943)\n, was a member of a string quartet performing Hungarian Dance No\n5\n(30\nApril\n1943)\n, was selected for the National Honor Society\n(28\nMay\n1943)\n, was elected secretary of the Forum Club\n(1\nOctober\n1943)\n, was elected secretary of the Fine Arts Club\n(11\nFebruary\n1944)\n, took part in District Scholarship Tests\n(10\nMarch\n1944)\n, performed in the play by George S Kaufman and Moss Hart \"The Man Who Came to Dinner\"\n(24\nMarch\n1944)\n, took part in a string trio at Fine Arts' assembly and was first viola at the Mount Union Music Festival\n(5\nMay\n1944)\n, was received into the National Thespian Honor Society\n(19\nMay\n1944)\n, and came\n14\nth in English in the District Scholarship Test\n(2\nJune\n1944)\n.\nThe most impressive activity reported in\nRed and Blue\n, however, was her success in the \"Quiz Kid\" competition. See the reports at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nCarol graduated from Alliance High School in\n1944\n. The report on her High School years described her as:-\nThe girl who knows all the answers.\nIn the summer of\n1945\nthe Vander Velde family moved from Alliance to Bremen, Indiana\n[\n4\n]\n:-\n[\nCarol's\n]\nparents were not educated beyond high school,Â butÂ they encouraged their children to pursue a college education.\nShe attended Manchester College in North Manchester, Indiana, abut\n65\nkm south east of Bremen. This small college, run by the United Brethren Church, had been founded in\n1860\n. She received her BA from there inÂ\n1948\n. Also in\n1948\nthe Vander Velde family moved from Bremen, Indiana, to Ionia, Grand Rapids, Michigan. Around the same time Carol moved to Michigan too, enrolling for a Master's degree at Michigan State CollegeÂ\n(\nnow Michigan State University\n)\nin East Lansing.\nHer Master's Degree in mathematics was obtained two years later, in\n1950\n, from Michigan State University and, following this, she spent the summer as an instructor at Michigan State University, and then for a time travelled around the United States as a violinist in an all-female orchestra. She then continued her studies at the University of Southern California, enrolling a postgraduate student in\n1951\n.Â On\n21\nJune\n1952\nshe married Arthur Louis Karp in Los Angeles, California. Arthur Karp\n(1930\n-\n2020)\nhad been born in the Bronx, New York City on\n20\nJune\n1930\n. He received a B.S. in Physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, an M.S. in Mathematics from New Mexico State University, then studied Mathematics at the University of California\n(\nBerkeley\n)\n. After qualifying as a Doctor of JurisprudenceÂ from Georgetown University Law Center he served in the United States Army Signal Corps Agency followed by a post as a Systems Analyst at the Center for Naval Analyses. After her marriage to Arthur Karp, Carol was known as Carol Karp.\nHer doctoral thesis was on mathematical logic. The thesis,Â\nLanguages with expressions of infinite length\n, was supervised by Leon Henkin\n(1921\n-\n2006)\nand submitted to the University of Southern California inÂ\n1959\n. It was examined by Henkin and Henry Abel Dye\n(1926\n-\n1986)\n. However Karp was teaching several years before the award of her Ph.D. having accepted a position as instructor at New Mexico College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts inÂ\n1953\n. InÂ\n1960\nÂ the name of the New Mexico College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts was changed to its present name of New Mexico State University. Karp spent a year at the College in Las Cruces, New Mexico.\nHer thesis advisor had moved to Berkeley inÂ\n1953\nÂ and Karp was appointed as a teaching assistant there fromÂ\n1954\nÂ toÂ\n1956\nÂ while she worked on her doctoral thesis\n[\n3\n]\n:-\nIn the fall of\n1956\nHenkin and\nAlfred Tarski\norganised a seminar at Berkeley on infinitary logic, where Karp presented her work on the syntax of predicate logic with infinitely long expressions. While other logicians had previously used expressions of infinite length, hers was the first comprehensive work on the extension of first order logic to languages that allow infinite conjunctions and disjunctions, as well as quantification over infinite sets of variables.\nInÂ\n1957\n, she moved to Japan with her husband who, as we have indicated above, was in the US Navy. On her return from Japan, Karp accepted a post as an instructor at the University of Maryland.Â Before she submitted her thesis, Karp published four abstracts in Volume\n5\nof the\nNotices\nof the\nAmerican Mathematical Society\n. Two had the title\nFormalizations of functional languages with wffs of infinite length\n, and the other two were\nFormalisms for\nP\nÎ±\n,\nF\nÎ±\nÎ²\nP_{\\alpha}, F_{\\alpha\\beta}\nP\nÎ±\nâ\n,\nF\nÎ±\nÎ²\nâ\nand\nÎ±\n\\alpha\nÎ±\n-complete Boolean algebras,\nand\nSplit semantic models\n.\nSoon after the award of her doctorate Karp was promoted, inÂ\n1960\n, to assistant professor at the University of Maryland. She was to remain at the University of Maryland until her early death from cancer inÂ\n1972\nÂ but there she was promoted again, to associate professor inÂ\n1963\nÂ and then to full professor inÂ\n1966\n.Â Tiffany Wayne writes\n[\n11\n]\n:-\nHer work was internationally recognised, and she was able to recruit other faculty\n[\nsuch as James Owings and Edgar G K LÃ³pez-Escobar\n]\nand a steady stream of graduate students\n[\nR J Gauntt, J Gregory, J Green, and E Cunningham\n]\nto the University of Maryland. She was instrumental in bringing several important participants to the colloquia that she sponsored, and she and he husband even had a home with an extra apartment in which visiting logicians were frequently housed.\nWe have seen that Karp was a mathematical logician but, as noted inÂ\n[\n6\n]\n, her work was closely related to algebra:-\nKarp considered herself to be principally an 'algebraic logician'. Her inclination towards algebra was never completely forgotten and she always seemed to draw results concerning\nBoolean algebras\nfrom her results about infinitary languages.\nIn\n1962\nshe published the paper\nIndependence Proofs in Predicate Logic with Infinitely Long Expressions\n. Karp writes in the introduction to the paper:-\nThe systems of predicate logic considered here are extension first-order predicate logic. They were obtained by first admitting infinite conjunctions, disjunctions, and quantifications into formulas, and then adjusting the axiom schemata and rules of inference to accommodate them. In this paper, only systems with formulas of denumerable length and \"formal proofs\" with denumerably many steps will be discussed, though  such restrictions are hardly essential. A precise treatment of these and other systems appears in the author's doc dissertation, Languages with expressions of infinite length, presented to the faculty of the University of Southern California in partial fulfilment of requirements for the Ph.D. degree. It is being prepared for publication in monograph form. The author wishes to thank her thesis supervisor, Professor Leon Henkin, for his encouragement and support over the years, as well as for specific suggestions relating to this paper. Thanks are due also to Professor\nAlfred Tarski\nfor suggestions offered when an early version of some of this material was presented at a seminar in Berkeley in\n1956\n. This paper was prepared with the aid of a faculty grant from the University of Maryland, and National Science Foundation grant GI\n1294\n.\nInÂ\n1964\nÂ she published a book on her researchÂ\nLanguages with expressions of infinite length\n. You can read the Preface of that work at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nShe had hoped to write another work which would take her ideas considerably further. She lectured on this later work as described inÂ\n[\n6\n]\n:-\nKarp did give lectures at Maryland in the Fall ofÂ\n1970\nÂ on infinitary logic and recursion theory. Basically Karp wanted to return toÂ\nGÃ¶del\n's original proof-theoretic definitions of recursive sets but of course using more liberal notions of proof so as to obtain generalisations of recursion theory.\nEdgar G K Lopez-Escobar writes in\n[\n7\n]\n:-\nCarol Karp died on August\n20\n,\n1972\nafter a brave battle against cancer which had lasted for three long years. To her, teaching had always been more than a duty, and even during her illness she taught all her classes in addition to carrying out her administrative tasks. Her research, too, was pushed forward with her usual determination, but unfortunately the planned new monograph on infinitary languages remained unfinished. Her early work was collected in her one published book, but she realised that it very much needed to be brought up to date. Towards the end she was rather apprehensive that her doctoral students would not be able to complete their studies; but her fears were unfounded ... To them as to us the memory of the conduct of her life, exceptional spirit and warm personality persists as a lasting inspiration. The new book was intended for the Springer series 'Perspectives in Mathematical Logic'. Carol Karp was in the habit of doing most of her own research work during the summer months. Unfortunately the necessary treatment in\n1972\nleft her exhausted and vulnerable to virus infections, so that there was barely time for her to organise the material for the beginning chapters. The final chapter was to be based on her lectures Generalized Recursion Theories at the Manchester Summer School\n(1969\n, unpublished\n)\n, and from her notes it is apparent that she viewed it as the greatest contribution of the monograph. The gist of the programme was to show that the most natural way of generalising recursion theory was through representability in formal theories with infinitely long formulas.\nIt was both as a teacher and researcher that Karp made her reputation. She cared personally for her students and worried greatly for their futures during her illness.\nJudy Green, who was one of Karp's doctoral students, wrote the article inÂ\n[\n2\n]\n. In it she writes:-\nKarp's intellectual standards were extremely high, and she was unfailingly honest in applying them. Although she showed almost familial concern for her students and younger colleagues, she was consistently candid in appraising their mathematical contributions and promise. In particular, she advised working towards a doctorate only if one expected to make research the most important part of one's professional career, and she refused to allow her students to graduate until their results met her own high standard for publishability.",
