  "biografia": "The three\nBanu Musa brothers\nare almost indistinguishable and most of the information is at\nTHIS LINK\n. However, there is some information specific to the youngest brother:\nal-Hasan ibn Musa ibn Shakir.\nHe wrote\nThe elongated circular figure\nwhich is a work on the\nellipse\n. This book is lost except for a fragment in Hebrew of a compilation by Ibn al-Samh. From this fragment Rashed in\n[\n3\n]\ndeduces that al-Hasan had two objectives. One objective was to measure a curved area while the other was to study the geometric properties of curves. Rashed claims, as we have suggested above, that while\nArchimedes\n' texts were being translated into Arabic for the first time, the Banu Musa\n(\nperhaps al-Hasan in particular\n)\nwas trying to give new proofs of the Greek results as well as trying to prove results going beyond what the Greeks had achieved.\nTHIS LINK",
