  "biografia": "Gaston Tarry\nwas born in  Villefranche-de-Rouergue which is located in south central France. He attended the LycÃ©e Saint-Louis in Paris where he became interested in mathematics. He never looked for an academic career as a mathematician, however, and joined the Contributions Diverses de l'Administration des Finances\n(\nFrench Financial Administration\n)\n. He spent the whole of his working life in Algeria. France had invaded Algeria in\n1830\nand French rule was established by\n1847\n. Tarry was part of the French administration in Algeria, retiring in\n1902\n.\nAlthough an amateur mathematician, Tarry had an amazing ability to analyse combinatorial problems. One has simply to feel amazement at some of the problems he solved using purely combinatorial and calculating skills. We give some examples below to illustrate both the type of problem which interested him and also to illustrate his undoubted genius. Even more surprising is the fact that his mathematical achievements came after the age of fifty.\nHe published a solution to the problem of finding the way out of a maze in\n1895\n, a problem which had been of interest from classical times. Tarry was not the first to give a systematic method so solve a maze, for TrÃ©maux had found a method which was reported by\nLucas\nin\n1881\n. However, the method given by Tarry in\n[\n3\n]\ngave a different approach with an algorithm which, in today's terminology, would be described as depth-first search algorithm. It is particularly suitable to computer implementation. In\n[\n4\n]\n, Tarry gave a general method for finding the number of\nEuler\ncircuits.\nTarry also solved\nEuler\n's\n36\nOfficer Problem, proving that two orthogonal Latin squares of order\n6\ndo not exist. The problem as stated by\nEuler\nis as follows:-\nHow can a delegation of six regiments, each of which sends a colonel, a lieutenant-colonel, a major, a captain, a lieutenant, and a sub-lieutenant be arranged in a regular\n6\nÃ\n6\narray such that no row or column duplicates a rank or a regiment?\nIn the two papers\n[\n5\n]\nand\n[\n6\n]\nTarry showed that such an arrangement is impossible.\nBefore explaining Tarry's contributions to\nmagic squares\n, let us introduce some terminology. First we note that a\nmagic square\nof order\nn\nn\nn\ncontains the numbers\n1\nto\nn\n2\nn^{2}\nn\n2\nin an\nn\nÃ\nn\nn \\times  n\nn\nÃ\nn\narray such that each row, each column, and the two main diagonals all have the same sum. Such squares were well known long before Tarry's time. A\npanmagic square\n, or\ndiabolic square\n, is a magic square in which all the diagonals\n(\nwhich come from identifying the two sides, and identifying the top and bottom\n)\nadd to the same number. Tarry explained how he became involved with such magic squares\n(\nsee\n[\n7\n]\nand\n[1])\n:-\nFor about three years, a friend of Alger\n[\nBrutus Portier\n]\n, a keen magician, never stopped titillating me in order that I take an interest in magic squares. I disregarded him, because I didn't like what I considered as a Chinese game giving me a headache. One day, my magic teacher\n(\nhe forced himself to be my teacher in spite of me\n)\n, claimed to me that it was not possible to construct diabolic squares\n(\npanmagic\n)\nof order\n3\nn\n3n\n3\nn\n, with\nn\nn\nn\nbeing not divisible be\n3\n. This astonished me.\nTarry was right to be astonished because Brutus Portier was wrong. Panmagic squares of order\n3\nn\n3n\n3\nn\n, where\nn\nn\nn\nis not divisible by\n3\n, do exist and indeed Tarry was the first to prove this when he constructed the first panmagic square of order\n15\n. This began Tarry's interest in magic squares, which one has to suggest, turned into a passion. Before explaining another major achievement that he accomplished on magic squares we need to explain another couple of terms. First a\nbimagic square\nis a magic square with the property that the rows, columns and main diagonals add to the same number when each of the entries is squared. A bimagic square is\ntrimagic\nif also the cubes of the entries in the rows, columns and main diagonals add to the same constant. Tarry was the first to find an example of a trimagic square. It had order\n128\nand was presented in\n[\n7\n]\n(\nSee also\n[1])\n. He called his method of construction the \"cabalistic condensator\" and wrote:-\nThis condensator is a real magic machine charged at the limit. In discharging it, we will obtain magical effects. The discharge can only stay in a good conductive environment, a magic field.\nPoincarÃ©\nwas so impressed by Tarry's results that he presented them to the\nAcademy of Sciences\n. In the same paper Tarry introduced the term\ntetramagic square\nfor a square which is trimagic and also the fourth powers of the entries in the rows, columns and main diagonals add to the same constant. He could not find such a tetramagic square, and indeed the problem was not solved until\n2001\nwhen a\n256\nÃ\n256\ntetramagic square was discovered.\nGabriel Arnoux published two books\nArithmÃ©tique graphique - Les espaces arithmÃ©tiques, leurs transformations\nâ\n(\nArithmetical graphics  - Arithmetic spaces and their transformations\n)\n(1908)\nand\nEssai de gÃ©omÃ©trie analytique modulaire Ã  deux dimensions\nâ\n(\nTreatise on modular analytic geometry in two dimensions\n)\n(1911)\n. Although these were originally single author works, he collaborated with Tarry on producing second editions.\nTarry is also remembered for some other stunning combinatorial results.
