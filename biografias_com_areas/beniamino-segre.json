  "biografia": "Beniamino Segre\nwas related to\nCorrado Segre\nwho was a cousin of Beniamino's mother. Beniamino attended school in Turin and, at the age of sixteen having won a university scholarship, he entered Turin University in\n1919\n. His teachers at Turin University included\nGuiseppe Peano\n,\nGino Fano\n,\nGuido Fubini\n, Carlo Somigliana and\nCorrado Segre\n. Beniamino graduated from Turin in\n1923\nhaving written a geometry dissertation on the double curves of symmetroids in\nS\n4\nS_{4}\nS\n4\nâ\nentitled\nGenera della curva doppia per la varieta di\nS\n4\nS_{4}\nS\n4\nâ\nche annulla un determinante simmetrico\nâ\n(\nClassificcton of the double curve for the variety of S\n4\ncancelling a symmetric determinant\n)\n. His thesis advisor was\nCorrado Segre\n. Few mathematicians have published a substantial paper in a totally different area of mathematics from their thesis in the year they graduated but this is exactly what Segre achieved publishing\nSul moto sferico vorticoso di un fluide incompressibile\nâ\n(\nOn vortex spherical motion of an incompressible fluid\n)\n(1923)\n. This paper on hydrodynamics studied the origins of anti-cyclones. He was appointed to the post of assistant professor in Turin where he remained until\n1926\n. After studying in Paris with\nÃlie Cartan\nfor the year\n1926\n-\n27\n, supported by a Rockefeller scholarship, Segre became\nFrancesco Severi\n's assistant in Rome.\nBy\n1931\nwhen he was appointed to the Chair of Geometry at the University of Bologna he already had\n40\npublications in\nalgebraic geometry\n,\ndifferential geometry\n,\ntopology\nand\ndifferential equations\n. He married Fernanda Coen from Como in\n1932\n, 'a very gentle and sensitive lady'. They had three children and\n[\n14\n]\n:-\n... to the end of their lives the marriage was one of the deepest affection and understanding, and their friends are hardly able to think of either of them without the other.\nThe Fascist Italian Government passed laws against those of Jewish background. Article\n4\nof the Royal Decree Law of\n5\nSeptember\n1938\nwas titled 'Measures for the defence of race in fascist schools' and, after Segre had been identified as Jewish by the University of Bologna, he was expelled from the University on\n16\nOctober\n1938\n. By this time he, along with\nTullio Levi-Civita\n, were managing the journal\nAnnali di Matematica\nand, also in October\n1938\n, both were relieved of their positions\n(\nLevi-Civita\nwas also Jewish\n)\n. Segre, with his wife and three young children, fled to England as refugees. However, this was a particularly difficult time for them as\nPatrick du Val\nrelated\n[\n14\n]\n:-\n[\nIn England they lived for a time in London and Cambridge; but in\n1940\nhe was interned as an enemy alien in the Isle of Man. This was probably the unhappiest period in the family's life, and later they were rarely willing to speak of it at all; during it, while Mrs Segre was living in London with\nLeonard Roth\nand his Italian wife, who were old friends, their youngest child died; and when the Andorra Star, carrying prisoners of war and internees to Canada, was sunk in the Atlantic, she had no idea for some time whether her husband was on it or not. However, that phase of hysteria in our country passed off relatively soon, and most of the internees were released. Segre rejoined his family in London and later they returned to Cambridge, but it is perhaps hardly surprising that his list of publications shows a marked gap during the early war years.\nOf course, despite the extremely difficult circumstances, Segre continued to devote himself to mathematics, writing the monograph\nThe Non-singular Cubic Surfaces\nduring these years. It was published in\n1942\nby Oxford University Press.\nOscar Zariski\nwrites in a review:-\nThis monograph contains a most exhaustive study of nonsingular cubic surfaces, especially in the real domain. As the author tells us in the preface, his object is to give a complete theory of what\nCayley\nhas called \"the complicated and many-sided symmetry\" of the relations between the\n27\nlines of a cubic surface. Such a theory naturally entails a minute analysis of an endless row of details, each of which represents a feature of the complicated pattern of the above-mentioned symmetry relations. This emphasis on details, which is inherent to the subject matter, and the methodical way in which the author goes about his object of exhausting the properties of a cubic surface may frighten away some readers who prefer in mathematics a better balance between the general and the particular, between the abstract and the concrete. But the reader who is willing, so to speak, to live for a while on a cubic surface and to read the book in the spirit in which it has been written will be greatly rewarded by the elegance and ingenuity of the author's treatment of the subject.\nSegre was appointed to a teaching post in Manchester with\nLouis Mordell\nin\n1942\n. This was a period during which he made exceptional research contributions on algebraic geometry but his interests also broadened, stimulated by discussions with\nMordell\nand\nKurt Mahler\n, to diophantine equations and the arithmetic of algebraic varieties. In\n1946\nhe returned to Bologna succeeding\nFrancesco Severi\nin Rome in\n1950\n. Edoardo Vesentini, the author of\n[\n16\n]\nand\n[\n17\n]\n, became Segre's research student soon after he arrived in Rome. He writes\n[\n17\n]\n:-\nBeniamino Segre was very busy at that time\n(\nas, in fact, at all times of his life\n)\n. Besides discharging several academic duties outside the University of Rome, he was teaching an undergraduate course in the Department of Mathematics of the University and an advanced course in the Istituto Nazionale di Alta Matematica.\nSegre's output of research papers on geometry and related topics reached nearly\n300\nnot counting a long list of other publications. He gained a high reputation for the quality of his writing as the following extracts from David Bernard Scott's review of Segre's\nLezioni di Geometria Moderna\nâ\n(\nLessons in modern geometry\n)\nVol I\n(1948)\nshow:-\nThe first part of this book is an introduction\n(\nof less than\n80\npages\n)\nto abstract algebra, especially the ideas of groups, rings and, above all, of fields. The presentation, which is completely lucid and yet avoids surfeiting the reader with detail, has clearly been carefully planned. ... The second part deals no less attractively with the foundations of linear projective geometry in an arbitrary field. ... The standards of rigour and accuracy achieved in this work are such as all mathematicians\n(\nand not merely algebraic geometers steeped in the traditions of the Italian school\n)\nwill appreciate.\nAn English edition, double the length of the original text, was published as\nLectures on Modern Geometry\nin\n1961\n. It is reviewed by\nPatrick du Val\nin\n[\n15\n]\n.\nSegre's contributions to geometry are many but, particularly in the latter part of his life, he is remembered for his study of geometries over fields other than the complex numbers. He gave a series of three lectures in London in\n1950\nwhich were published as\nArithmetical questions on algebraic varieties\nin\n1951\n. Many questions were asked in these lectures about how the results would change if the ground field were different.\nBy\n1955\nSegre was concentrating on geometries over a finite field and was producing results which we would now class as combinatorics rather than geometry. He collected many major results into a\n100\npage paper\nLe geometrie di Galois\nâ\n(\nGalois geometries\n)\n(1959)\nand a further\n200\npage paper\nForme e geometrie hermitiane, con particolare riguardo al caso finito\nâ\n(\nForms and Hermitian geometries, with particular regard to the finite case\n)\nin\n1965\nwas devoted to the case where the order of the ground field is a perfect square.\nIn\n[\n14\n]\nit is recounted how many of Segre's publications came from answering questions arising from lectures he attended. Some anecdotes are recounted in\n[\n14\n]\nabout Segre's participation in lectures of others:-\n... a lecture by\nHodge\nin Oxford ... ended with Segre and another member of the audience occupying opposite ends of the blackboard and holding forth quite independently. ... a lecture by\nSeveri\nin Harvard ... was constantly interrupted by\nLefschetz\nin strong disagreement: the situation developed with Segre at the blackboard, firmly explaining what he thought was the resolution of the difference, while\nSeveri\nand\nLefschetz\ncontinued to shout each other down in French.\nIn\n1973\nSegre reached the age of\n70\nand retired from his university chair. However, even before this he had semi-retired\n[\n14\n]\n:-\nNeither he nor his wife had much liked living in Rome, preferring their native Piedmont and Lombardy; and some time in the later\n1960\n's they abandoned their flat near the University and settled in Frascati with their two married children in adjacent houses, and lived happily surrounded by grandchildren.\nSadly his wife, who had been so close to him and a companion on all international trips he made in his later years, died suddenly in the autumn of\n1976\n. Segre continued to keep up the high work rate which had marked his whole career, but his wife's death was a blow from which he never recovered. He only survived his wife by a year. As to Segre's character we quote from Giuseppe Tallini\n[\n13\n]\n:-\nHe lived for science's sake and taught the sacrifice and complete dedication this requires and what he asked from himself - and it was quite a lot - he asked from others. Sometimes it was difficult to deal with him because of this brusqueness, but he had a great sensitivity and all who worked with him can testify his caring concern. The name of this great man already belongs to the history of mathematics among those who gave much to science and knowledge.\nA similar picture is painted by\ndu Val\n[\n14\n]\n:-\nSegre could sometimes seem, especially to anyone meeting him for the first time, conversationally somewhat forbidding, but in the company of friends he could relax very convivially. He was fond of children, and most children liked him at first sight. I know our own children loved him; and I vividly recall an occasion when he and his wife were staying with us, seeing him return from a walk with the children demonstrating a Russian dance all the way up our suburban street, to the astonishment of the neighbours. He was devoted to his own children and grandchildren, and always seemed at his happiest in their company.\nFinally we note a few of the honours which was given to him in recognition to his outstanding contributions. He was elected vice-president of the\nAccademia dei Lincei\nserving for two periods,\n1965\n-\n1967\nand\n1973\n-\n1976\n. He also served as president of the academy in\n1967\n-\n1973\nand again in\n1977\n. He was president of the\nAccademia dei XL\nduring\n1974\n-\n77\nand president of the Societe Europeenne de Culture in\n1977\n. He was elected to numerous academies including: the Academy of Sciences of the Institute of Bologna; the\nAcademy of Sciences of Turin\n; the Academy of Sciences, Letters and Arts of Palermo; the National Academy of Sciences, Letters and Arts Modena; the Ligurian Academy of Sciences and Letters; the Istituto Lombardo Accademia di Scienze e Lettere; the Accademia Petrarca di Lettere Arti e Scienze di Arezzo; the\nAcadÃ©mie des Sciences\nde l'Institut de France; the AcadÃ©mie des sciences, inscriptions et belles-lettres de Toulouse; the SociÃ©tÃ© Royale des Sciences de LiÃ¨ge; the\nAcadÃ©mie Royale de Belgique\n; and the Academia Nacional de Ciencias de Buenos Aires. He received medals such as the gold Medal of the Accademia dei XL, the Medaglia ai Benemeriti della cultura e dell'arte, the Grand Prix of the City of Bologna, the \"Golden Pen Award\" of the President of the Council of Ministers, the order of Cavaliere Gran Croce OMRI, and Chevalier de la LÃ©gion d'Honneur. He was awarded honorary degrees by the universities of Sussex, Bologna, and Bratislava. Finally, we note that he was one of two invited speakers in the Geometry and Topology section of the International Congress of Mathematicians held in Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA in\n1950\nand a plenary speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians held in Amsterdam in September\n1954\nwhen he gave the address\nGeometry upon an algebraic variety\n.",
