She was the second of a family of three daughters, and received her secondary education at Forfar Academy, where she became school Dux in\n1921\n. In the same year she won a Simson Bursary for Â£\n25\nfor four years in the University of St Andrews Bursary Competition.\nAt the University of St Andrews she became friendly with fellow mathematics student Agnes Mudie and both lived in University Hall. The two friends graduated in\n1925\nwith both being awarded MA\n(\nClass I\n)\n. The friendship remained for the rest of their lives. After graduating Margaret taught mathematics for a time at Dalkeith High School, where she lodged with a family she kept up with till later in life. She and Agnes Mudie both lived at Buchanan Hostel, East Suffolk Road, Edinburgh, and both joined the\nEdinburgh Mathematical Society\nin June\n1926\n. Margaret Boyle gave up teaching because of illness. In January\n1930\nshe wrote from Kirkden Manse, Letham, Angus to the hon. secretary of the\nEdinburgh Mathematical Society\n:-\nI left Edinburgh several years ago owing to a breakdown in health. As I am not likely to take up mathematics again, or be in the vicinity of Edinburgh, I regret that I must let my membership lapse.\nIn April\n1931\nshe married David Gardyne Dorward, the dominie of Logie Pert School, near Montrose in North Angus. They had two sons, the elder being David Campbell Dorward\n(\nborn in a Dundee nursing home on\n7\nAugust\n1933)\nwho became a well-known classical composer, and younger being John Dorward. In\n1938\nDavid, Margaret and family moved to Monikie near Dundee, where David was appointed the dominie of the local school, Monikie Primary School.\nAgnes Mudie, Margaret's close friend, became known to the family as 'Auntie' Nancy. Agnes and Margaret frequently attended the St Andrews University Hall Association for reunions with her fellow-residents. She had no job after marriage except being a wife and mother. When her husband died in\n1971\nshe moved to live with her son David and his wife in Edinburgh, where she died in September\n1995\n.",
