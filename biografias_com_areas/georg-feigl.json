  "biografia": "Georg Feigl\n's father, who earned his living importing goods, was also named Georg Feigl. Georg's mother, Maria Pinl was from Bohemia. When Georg was born his father was\n41\nyears old and his mother was\n27\n. He attended school\n(\nthe Johanneum\n)\nin Hamburg then, in\n1909\n, he began his studies at the University of Jena. Due to ill health his study of mathematics and physics took longer than expected and a severe chronic stomach problem forced him to interrupt his work on several occasions. He obtained a degree from Jena taking much longer than was normal because of his health problems, then in\n1919\nhe obtained a doctorate from Jena working under\nKoebe\n. His doctoral dissertation was on\nconformal mappings\n.\nIn\n1919\nFeigl became a budgeted assistant of\nSchmidt\nat the Mathematical Institute of the University of Berlin. Feigl's later research and teaching were both greatly influenced by\nSchmidt\n.\nRohrbach\nwrites in\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nGenerations of students in mathematics at the University of Berlin took the introductory course \"EinfÃ¼hrung in die hÃ¶here Mathematik\"\nâ\n(\nIntroduction to higher mathematics\n)\nwhich Feigl created and which after his death was published, in enlarged form, as a textbook\n(1953)\nby\nHans Rohrbach\n.\nIn\n1925\nFeigl became managing editor of the journal\nJahrbuchs Ã¼ber die Fortschritte der Mathematik\nâ\n(\nYearbook on the progress of mathematics\n)\n, the only reviewing journal at that time, which was produced in Berlin by the\nBerlin Academy of Sciences\n. In the same year Feigl married Maria Fleischer, the daughter of Paul Fleischer who was an economist. Feigl's mother died two years after his marriage, and his father died four years later.\nPromotion at Berlin came steadily for Feigl who was promoted in\n1927\nand then again to extraordinary professor in\n1933\n. Two years later, in\n1935\n, Feigl was appointed to the Chair of Mathematics at the University of Breslau where he was head of the Department. In\n[\n3\n]\nPinl explains that in Breslau:-\n... his aim was the building up and heading the Mathematical Institute through lectures, supervision of doctorates and\nhabilitation\n, cooperation with the Reich Association of German Mathematical Societies and Clubs and participation in managerial and scientific tasks for the German Experimental Institution for Aeronautics.\nFeigl wrote to several of his colleagues on\n30\nMay\n1935\nasking for their cooperation in setting up a new mathematics journal, the\nNeue Deutsche Forschungen\n. Feigl wanted\nSÃ¼ss\nfrom Freiburg,\nHamel\nfrom Berlin,\nKoebe\nfrom Leipzig, Kowalewski from Dresden and Tornier from GÃ¶ttingen to cooperate within the Mathematics Department of the Reich Research Council and help him identify doctoral dissertations which would be suitable for publication. Feigl explained in his letter to\nSÃ¼ss\n, written on\n30\nMay, that he was embarrassed by the fact that\nCompositio Mathematica\nwas publishing so many works by non-Aryans.\nIn\n1941\nFeigl was elected onto the Executive Committee of the\nGerman Mathematical Society\n. He worked with colleagues such as\nBehnke\n,\nSÃ¼ss\nand\nHamel\non the Instruction Commission of the\nGerman Mathematical Society\n, becoming head of the Commission. Mostly due to his health problems he had been forced to decide between concentrating on research or teaching, and he had decided to concentrate on the latter. He was therefore a natural choice to head the Instruction Commission both because of his interests and also because of his expertise.\nAlthough he had accepted the direction that the Nazis had taken Germany, Feigl was strongly opposed to Hitler and his regime so became increasingly alarmed when fellow mathematicians were arrested by the Gestapo. He wrote to\nSÃ¼ss\nexpressing his worries when\nErnst Mohr\nwas arrested in\n1944\nbut\nSÃ¼ss\nreassured him that\nMohr\nhad been careless\n(\nMohr\n's crime seemed to have been that he had listened to the BBC\n)\n.\nIn February\n1944\nFeigl had been ordered to report for active duty in the German army as an anti-aircraft gunner. With the help of\nSÃ¼ss\n, who supported him on behalf of the Reich Research Council, he successfully won exemption. Later that year he offered to cooperate on work with the military, by using the resources of his Mathematical Institute. The centre of Breslau was bombed on\n7\nOctober\n1944\nbut the Mathematical Institute was essentially undamaged\n(\nonly\n4\npanes of glass were broken\n)\n. At this time Feigl was working with\nSchmidt\non a book on differential and integral calculus. Feigl had been lecturing on this topic and his lectures were used as the basis for the book on which they worked. The manuscript of the book was, sadly, lost during the final stages of the war. Feigl's wife Maria said that it had been stolen by Poles in the county of Glatz\n(\ntoday Klodzko\n)\n. By January\n1945\nthe Russian army was advancing towards Breslau and a decision was taken to move the mathematicians from the city. In February Feigl and his colleagues moved the Mathematical Institute from Breslau to SchÃ¶nburg Castle at Wechselburg, not far from Leipzig. However, Feigl had required constant medication all through his life for his stomach condition and, not being able to obtain his medication at Wechselburg led to his death within a couple of months.\nFeigl worked on geometry, in particular the foundations of geometry and\ntopology\n. He was mainly interested in teaching, however, and he introduced many teaching reforms. Through him the modern approach of\nHilbert\nand\nKlein\nwas introduced into universities and even into secondary schools.",
