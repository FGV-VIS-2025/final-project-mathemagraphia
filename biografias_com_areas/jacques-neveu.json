  "biografia": "Jacques Neveu\nwas born and brought up in Belgium. He was born in Watermael-Boitsfort which is the French version of its name while the Dutch version of this town is Watermaal-Bosvoorde. It is now a residential suburb of the city of Brussels and is now, therefore, legally bilingual French/Dutch. The double name comes from the merging of two towns in the early\n19\nth century.\nNeveu went to France for university studies and continued to live in France for the rest of his life. He became a naturalised French citizen on\n3\nJune\n1965\n. His interests turned towards probability theory and he undertook research at the University of Paris advised by Robert Fortet. Fortet\n(1912\n-\n1998)\nhad been a student of\nMaurice FrÃ©chet\nand had been awarded a doctorate in\n1939\nfor his thesis\nSur l'itÃ©ration des substitutions algÃ©briques linÃ©aires Ã  une infinitÃ© de variables et ses applications Ã  la thÃ©orie des probabilitÃ©s en chaÃ®ne\nâ\n(\nOn the iteration of linear algebraic substitutions of an infinity of variables and Its applications to string probability theory\n)\n. Neveu was awarded his doctorate in\n1955\nfor his thesis\nEtude des semi-groupes de Markoff\nâ\n(\nStudy of the Markoff semi-groups\n)\n. He began publishing in\n1955\nand three of his papers appeared in that year, namely:\nSur une hypothÃ¨se de Feller Ã  propos de l'Ã©quation de Kolmogoroff\nâ\n(\non a Feller Hypothesis on the Kolmogoroff equation\n)\n;\nSemi-groupes gÃ©nÃ©ralisÃ©s et processus de Markoff\nâ\n(\nGeneralized semi-groups and Markoff processes\n)\n; and\nJeux de Markoff et problÃ¨mes d'absorption\nâ\n(\nMarkoff Games and absorption problems\n)\n.\nIt was in Paris that Neveu worked for the whole of his career beginning at the Faculty of Science. Along with Fortet, he was among the first members of the Laboratoire de ProbabilitÃ©s et ModÃ¨les AlÃ©atoires in\n1960\n. Neveu became a lecturer at the CollÃ¨ge de France in\n1962\n. Various changes, however, to the University of Paris meant that he was forced to make certain decisions about where he would work. We will discuss these below but first we look at various visits that Neveu made to the United States in the\n1960\ns.\nIn\n1961\nhe attended the\n4\nth Berkeley Symposium on Mathematical Statistics and Probability and contributed the paper\nLattice methods and submarkovian processes\nwhich was published in the\nProceedings\nof the Conference.\nThe American Mathematical Society records his visit to Berkeley in\n1965\n[\n14\n]\n:-\nIn\n1965\nBelgian-born French mathematician Jacques Neveu\n(1932\n-\n2016)\nwas in Berkeley teaching a course in modern probability theory. His time in the United States inspired generous gifts to the\nAmerican Mathematical Society\n. \"It is a great pleasure for me to contribute to the remarkable work done by the\nAmerican Mathematical Society\nwith the remembrance for all the marvellous contacts I have had with the American mathematical community,\" he wrote the\nAmerican Mathematical Society\nin\n2006\n.\nNeveu was in Berkeley to attend the Berkeley Symposium on Mathematical Statistics and Probability held in\n1965\n-\n66\n. He contributed the paper\nExistence of bounded invariant measures in ergodic theory\n. He gives his address on the paper as University of Paris and University of California Berkeley. The paper has a one sentence Introduction:-\nWe present a survey of some recent work done on the problem of existence of bounded invariant measure for positive contractions defined on\nL\n1\nL^{1}\nL\n1\n-spaces.\nLet us return to the story of the splitting of the University of Paris into thirteen separate universities in\n1970\n. Here is Michel Zisman's description of how these changes affected Neveu\n[\n16\n]\n:-\nI met Jacques Neveu at a very special moment in the history of Parisian universities,\n1969\n-\n71\n, where the only University of Paris with its headquarters at the Sorbonne gave birth to the thirteen universities that we know today. Jacques ... closely followed the painful and complex upheavals that accompanied the birth of the two French universities, Paris VI and Paris VII, which, with regard to mathematics, belonged to the old IHP, the\nHenri PoincarÃ©\nInstitute. Often, at the foot of the towers of Jussieu, we discussed the future that was open to us, our ability to act, to help guide it according to our ideal. At the time, the Mathematics Department of the University of Paris had a two-headed management, each of the two heads representing one of the two universities in the making, and I was, on\nFranÃ§ois Bruhat\n's initiative, one of those two. At that time, my discussions with Jacques revolved around what would happen to this still planned university, to which\nBruhat\nwould devote ten years of his life. In principle, teachers were free to choose their university, but in practice the choice of the laboratory head determined that of his colleagues, and so Jacques, following R Fortet, found himself in Paris VI where, he told me, he was not happy; so, as soon as he could, he went to the Ãcole Polytechnique.\nFrancis Comets tell us about Neveu's teaching in\n[\n3\n]\n:-\nAs a lecturer at the Paris Faculty of Sciences, Paris VI University and the Ãcole Polytechnique, he took great pleasure and care in his teaching, and he shared his passion with several generations of probabilists, scientists and engineers with varied vocations. His classes were always luminous, wonderfully compact, and full of that elegance that made his books get so many references today.\nWith this mention of his books, we should say something about them. They include\nThÃ©orie des semi-groups de Markov\nâ\n(\nMarkov Semi-group Theory\n)\n(1958)\n,\nBases mathÃ©matiques du calcul des probabilitÃ©s\nâ\n(\nMathematical basics of probability calculation\n)\n(1964)\n,\nMathematical foundations of the calculus of probability\n(1965)\n,\nProcessus alÃ©atoires gaussiens\nâ\n(\nRandom Gaussian processes\n)\n(1968)\n,\nMartingales Ã  temps discret\nâ\n(\nQuiet Time Martingales\n)\n(1972)\n, and\nDiscrete-parameter martingales\n(1975)\n. The books with English titles are translations of the earlier French ones.\nFor extracts from reviews of some of these works, as well as other information about them, see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nLet us record here a very brief extract from\n[\n4\n]\nwhich is typical of the praise reviewers have for Neveu's books:-\nThis is an excellent book by a brilliant mathematician, expertly and beautifully translated into English. As a text it is intended for study by advanced students\n(\ncorresponding roughly to the first or second year of graduate work in probability or measure theory in the United States and Canada\n)\nand as a reference work for researchers. There is no doubt that it will succeed brilliantly in fulfilling these aims.\nTo gain an appreciation of Neveu's outstanding research, we quote again from Francis Comets\n[\n3\n]\n:-\nFrom the beginning of his career his impact on the mathematical community and the French school of probability is obvious and striking, at a time when applied mathematics and probability theory in particular are still gaining ground. The first seminars he conducted in Paris stimulated a whole generation of young probabilists, implicitly in tandem with Paul-AndrÃ© Meyer and the Strasbourg School. All along, he played a central role in the development of probability theory, especially through the working groups he led in a lively way. His research is one of the most beautiful pages of probability theory:\nMarkov\nchains and processes, Gaussian processes, ergodic theory, potential theory, martingales, point measurements, random trees and branching processes. Beyond the fundamental aspects, he also contributed to the development of applications. In the field of stochastic networks, his founding works as well as the reading group he led on this subject at the end of the\n70\ns, structured the French community. Subsequently, he contributed to the links with fundamental computing, combinatorics and statistical physics. He also founded the group \"ModÃ©lisation AlÃ©atoire et Statistique\" of the SociÃ©tÃ© de MathÃ©matiques AppliquÃ©es et Industrielles\n[\nin\n1991]\n.\nMichel Zisman explains in\n[\n16\n]\nthat after Neveu left the Paris VI University and worked in the Ãcole Polytechnique:-\n... we did not see each other anymore; it should have been the end of our friendship: chance decided otherwise. My wife owns a small family home in La Ripe, a hamlet of ten inhabitants above the Yonne, where we spent all our holidays. We did our shopping in Mailly-le-ChÃ¢teau, on the other side of the Yonne. One day we meet Jacques and his wife, Monique, at the baker's! The Neveus had bought a beautiful property in this Burgundy village, three kilometres from us. A beautiful mansion, a beautiful flower garden terrace on the back overlooking the river and, on the other side of the street, a vegetable garden. In the living room, Jacques had installed a magnificent fireplace built to his plans, in which he liked to burn tree trunks of good size, for the great joy of his guests when the weather was cool. It was in this context that Jacques discovered a new passion. He had always liked to cook, and he cooked very well; he now cooked the vegetables and fruits of his own garden. Depending on the season, turning over the land, pruning trees or roses, preparing seedlings, harvesting strawberries or leeks, he was always at work! Difficult to leave this welcoming home without taking a jar of plum jam or jelly.\nOther academics, scientists: some renowned archaeologists, physicists, curators of the Louvre Museum, chose to buy a second home in Mailly-le-ChÃ¢teau and found themselves around the Neveus. This peaceful village, two hours from Paris, which for decades evoked angling in the Yonne or climbing on the cliffs of Saussois and was known around the world for high places for climbing became unknowingly the seat of a curious literary set where the quality of the cuisine of Jacques and Monique disputed with the richness of the conversation!\nThese happy days are a thing of the past. With the coming of age and the accumulating fatigue, Jacques had to call on a professional to execute the heavy work in his gardens. Their beautiful house in Mailly-le-ChÃ¢teau was closed all year in\n2015\n. Monique died of cancer and Jacques followed soon after her. A few days before his death, he called me to tell me he was in the hospital ...\nNeveu was honoured with being elected to the Inaugural Class of Fellows of the\nAmerican Mathematical Society\nin\n2013\n. He was elected president of the\nSociÃ©tÃ© MathÃ©matique de France\nfor\n1977\n-\n78\n. The group which he founded, the \"ModÃ©lisation AlÃ©atoire et Statistique\"\nâ\n(\nRandom and statistical modeling\n)\nof the SociÃ©tÃ© de MathÃ©matiques AppliquÃ©es et Industrielles, inaugurated a prize awarded to the person judged to have the best doctoral dissertation in mathematicians or statistics in France in the year of the award. Special attention is given to theses having important links with other fields\n(\nlife science, material science, engineering science, physical sciences, ... or a strong involvement in the dissemination of knowledge to the industrial field. It was first awarded in\n2008\n.\nLet us leave the final comment to Francis Comets\n[\n3\n]\n:-\nHis work in the Probability Laboratory at Jussieu and the Centre for Applied Mathematics at the Ãcole Polytechnique remains an example of clairvoyance, generosity and discernment. Friendly and considerate, of a great culture and sensitivity, his company was sought after. Like many of us, I have a very vivid memory of Jacques Neveu's quick intelligence, of his inexhaustible taste for rigour, for the elegance of his thought.",
