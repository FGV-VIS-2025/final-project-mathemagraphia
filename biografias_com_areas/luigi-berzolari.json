  "biografia": "Luigi Berzolari\n's father was an infantry officer serving during a very difficult period. Italy was unified three years before Luigi was born and he grew up in a country that was coming to terms with this important event. The\n1860\nunification did not solve Italy's problems for Rome was not part of the newly created country. At the time when Luigi was born, Naples, the city of his birth, was the largest in Italy but it was a city of poverty and disease. The army was fully occupied in putting down peasant revolts and, after becoming involved in the\n1866\nwar between Prussia and Austria, sought to bring Rome into the new Italy by force in the following year. Luigi's father was killed in the fighting round the major fortress at Gaeta so, from the age of four, he was brought up by his mother. Only in\n1871\ndid Rome become the capital of Italy.\nAfter the death of Luigi's father, his mother returned to her home town of Mortara, in Lombardy, where Luigi attended elementary school. He attended middle school in Pavia where one of his mathematics teachers was\nSalvatore Pincherle\nwho taught for the three years\n1874\n-\n77\nat the liceo in Pavia. In\n1880\nBerzolari entered the University of Pavia and he lived in Ghislieri College, an ancient college founded by pope Pius V in\n1567\n. At university, he studied mathematics with\nEugenio Beltrami\n,\nEugenio Bertini\nand\nFelice Casorati\n. He graduated with his laurea in\n1884\nand continued to work at Pavia as an assistant to\nCasorati\n, who held the chair of infinitesimal calculus. He published his first work, coming from his laurea thesis, in\n1885\n, namely\nSulla superficie del quarto ordine avente una conica doppia\nâ\n(\nOn the surface of the fourth order having a double conical point\n)\n. Then, remaining at Pavia, he became an assistant to Ferdinando Aschieri, who held the chair of projective and descriptive geometry. However, in addition to his work as an assistant at the university, he taught mathematics in middle schools in Pavia and Vigevano. He also spent a short time teaching in the military academy in Turin in\n1888\n. In\n1892\nhe received his 'libero docente', which is similar to the\nhabilitation\nand gives the right to lecture in universities, and became a lecturer in analytic and projective geometry at Pavia having, by this time, published ten papers including the major work\nRicerche sulle trasformazioni piane, univoche, involutorie, e loro applicazioni alla determinazione delle involuzioni di quinta classe\nâ\n(\nResearch on  unique, involutory plane transformations, and their application to the determination of the fifth class of involutions\n)\nin\n1889\nand two papers with the title\nIntorno alla rappresentazione delle forme binarie cubiche e biquadratiche sulla cubica gobba\nâ\n(\nOn the representation of binary forms on cubic and biquadratic cubic hump\n)\nin\n1891\n.\nBerzolari entered the competition for the chair of analytic and projective geometry at the University of Rome in\n1891\n. The referees were\nEugenio Bertini\n,\nEnrico D'Ovidio\nand\nGiuseppe Veronese\n. Among the candidates who were eligible to enter the competition, in addition to Berzolari, there was\nGuido Castelnuovo\n,\nAlfonso Del Re\n, and\nMario Pieri\n.\nCastelnuovo\nwas a clear winner and appointed to the chair; Berzolari came third behind\nDel Re\n. Two years later, in\n1893\n, Berzolari entered the competition for the chair of projective geometry at the University of Naples. The referees were Ferdinando Aschieri,\nEugenio Bertini\n, Francesco Chizzoni, Vittorio Martinetti, and\nGiuseppe Veronese\n. In addition to Berzolari,\nDomenico Montesano\n,\nDel Re\nand\nPieri\nwere candidates. This proved a very close contest with\nMontesano\njust coming out ahead of Berzolari. Later in the same year of\n1893\nthere was a second chair competition, this time for the chair of projective and descriptive geometry at the University of Turin. It came about through the death of\nGiuseppe Bruno\nin February of\n1893\n. The referees were Ferdinando Aschieri,\nEugenio Bertini\n,\nEnrico D'Ovidio\n,\nCorrado Segre\n, and\nGiuseppe Veronese\n. Berzolari was ranked first with\nMario Pieri\nand\nAlfonso Del Re\ntied for second place. He was appointed and taught at the University of Turin for six years; there\nPieri\nbecame his assistant and, from\n1896\n,\nBeppo Levi\nwas also his assistant for two years.\nIt certainly appeared that Berzolari would spend the rest of his career at Turin but, in\n1899\n, he entered the competition for a chair at the University of Pavia. He was appointed and served as director of the mathematical institute at Pavia for the rest of his life. He did have a one-year break away from Pavia, spending the academic year\n1924\n-\n1925\nteaching at the University of Milan. His merits as a scientist and a teacher earned him many honours at Pavia: he was rector of the University twice, from\n1909\nto\n1913\nand from\n1920\nto\n1922\n, and dean of the faculty of sciences in the periods\n1907\n-\n1909\n,\n1916\n-\n1920\n, and\n1925\n-\n1929\n. Of course he held these important influential roles at a time, beginning around\n1920\n, when Fascism gripped Italy. By\n1922\nMussolini was in power in Italy and Fascist policies were imposed. Berzolari showed great courage in opposing fascism in the early days when he was rector but then ceased all attempts at resistance and accepted it as inevitable.\nTo give an idea of his contributions to geometry, we mention a few of his papers:\nSugli invarianti differenziali proiettivi delle curve di un iperspazio\nâ\n(\nOn differential invariants of projective curves of a hyperspace\n)\n(1897)\n,\nSulle coniche appoggiate in piÃ¹ punti a date curve algebriche\nâ\n(\nOn the cone supported in several places in given algebraic curves\n)\n(1900)\n,\nSul significato geometrico di alcune identitÃ  lineari fra quadrati di forme algebriche\nâ\n(\nOn the geometric meaning of some linear algebraic identities between square shapes\n)\n(1918)\n, and\nSul complesso di covarianti di tre complessi lineari a due a due in involuzione\nâ\n(\nOn the covariant complex of three linear complex pairwise in involution\n)\n(1922)\n. He published some popular books:\nSulla teoria delle curve razionali\nâ\n(\nOn the theory of rational curves\n)\n(1898)\n, and the two-volume treatise\nGeometria analitica\nâ\n(\nAnalytical geometry\n)\n(1911\n-\n1916)\n, with later editions in\n1920\n-\n22\nand\n1925\n-\n42\n. He wrote over\n40\nobituaries, including:\nDella vita e delle opere di Luigi Cremona\nâ\n(\nOf the life and work of Luigi Cremona\n)\n(1906)\n,\nCommemorazione di Max Noether\nâ\n(\nCommemoration of Max Noether\n)\n(1921)\n,\nCommemorazione di Corrado Segre\nâ\n(\nCommemoration of Corrado Segre\n)\n(1924)\n,\nCommemorazione di Felix Klein\nâ\n(\nCommemoration of Felix Klein\n)\n(1925)\n,\nCenni necrologici di C Neumann\nâ\n(\nObituary of C  Neumann\n)\n(1925)\n,\nCenni necrologici di G Ricci Curbastro\nâ\n(\nObituary of G Ricci Curbastro\n)\n(1925)\n,\nBreve commemorazione di G Mittag-Leffler\nâ\n(\nShort commemoration of G Mittag-Leffler\n)\n(1927)\n,\nCommemorazione di Eugenio Bertini\nâ\n(\nCommemoration of Eugenio Bertini\n)\n(1933)\n,\nCommemorazione di Alexander von Brill\nâ\n(\nCommemoration of Alexander von Brill\n)\n(1935)\n, and\nCommemorazione di Salvatore Pincherle\nâ\n(\nCommemoration of Salvatore Pincherle\n)\n(1936)\n.\nThe Mathesis Association for Research into Instruction in Middle Schools was founded in\n1895\nand, although it only admitted schoolteachers at first, it opened up to university professors in\n1908\n. In the following year a proposal was brought forward by Roberto Bonola for the society to produce a mathematics encyclopaedia and Berzolari was appointed to head the commission\n(\nwhich included Bonola\n)\n. The editorial board was Berzolari together with\nDuilio Gigli\nand\nGiulio Vivanti\n. The aim of the encyclopaedia was:-\nTo present to mathematics teachers and students in teachers' colleges a complete summary of elementary mathematics, not just to save time and effort for those who would desire precise and reliable reports on such elementary considerations, but also with the principal aim to diffuse the culture of mathematics among those who do not have the fortune to reside in a university centre, and cannot easily obtain materials to study... .\nAs well as heading the editorial board, Berzolari wrote a number of articles for the\nEnciclopedia delle Matematiche Elementari\n(1923\n-\n1950)\n:\nCalcolo combinatorico\nâ\n(\nCombinatorial calculation\n)\n;\nElementi della teoria dei gruppi\nâ\n(\nElements of group theory\n)\n;\nDeterminanti\nâ\n(\nDeterminants\n)\n; and\nEquazioni lineari\nâ\n(\nLinear equations\n)\n;\nSostituzioni lineari, forme lineari, bilineari, quadratiche\nâ\n(\nLinear substitutions, linear, bilinear, quadratic  forms\n)\n.\nBerzolari was honoured in many different ways. He was elected as president of the Mathesis Association and of the\nItalian Mathematical Union\nsucceeding the founder of the Union\nSalvatore Pincherle\nin\n1933\n. He was also president of the Lombard Institute of Science and Letters. He was elected to the\nReale Accademia dei Lincei\nin\n1919\n. He was also elected to the Academy of Sciences of Turin, the Academy of Science of the Institute of Bologna and the Academy Pontaniana of Naples.",
