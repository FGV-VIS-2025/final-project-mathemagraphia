  "biografia": "Georg Landsberg\n's parents were Bernhard Landsberg and Philippina Buttermilch. Bernhard Landsberg was a businessman, but we have not been able to find any further information about him. We have, however, found background information about his wife, Philippina, the mother of Georg the subject of this biography. Philippina was born in Leszno, Greater Poland, Poland on\n2\nOctober\n1824\nto Jacob Buttermilch\n(1800\n-\n1866)\nand Elka Gottstein\n(1796\n-\n1872)\n. Bernhard and Philippina married and had at least two children, Georg, the subject of this biography, and a daughter Regina Landsberg. Philippina Landsberg died on\n3\nJanuary\n1898\nin Breslau.\nLandsberg attended the St Elisabeth Gymnasium in Breslau. This famous school had been founded in\n1293\nand, after changing its name several times, became the St Elisabeth\nGymnasium\n, named after the mother of John the Baptist. New buildings which had been built in the\n1830\ns were being extended while Landsberg was a pupil as the popular school ran out of space. When Landsberg began his schooling there the headmaster was Karl Rudolf Fickert\n(1807\n-\n1888)\n. Fickert, a classics scholar of high repute, had been headmaster from\n1845\nbut retired in\n1880\nin the middle of Landsberg's time at the school. The new headmaster was Johannes Paech\n(1839\n-\n1907)\nwho filled this role from\n1881\nto\n1907\n. Landsberg mentions both Fickert and Paech in the CV he inserted at the end of his\n1890\ndoctoral thesis\n[\n4\n]\n.\nAfter completing his studies at the St Elisabeth Gymnasium, Landsberg then studied at the Universities of Breslau and Leipzig between\n1883\nand\n1889\n. We know about the topics that he studied at these universities since he names and thanks all his lecturers in the CV attached to his doctoral thesis\n[\n4\n]\n. At Breslau he was taught mathematics by\nJakob Rosanes\n,\nHeinrich SchrÃ¶ter\nand Otto Staude\n(1857\n-\n1928)\n.\nRosanes\ntaught at Breslau from\n1870\nbecoming a full professor from\n1876\n, and continuing to hold this position for the rest of his career. He worked on algebraic geometry and invariant theory.\nSchrÃ¶ter\nhabilitated\nat Breslau in\n1855\nand became a professor there in\n1861\n. He created at Breslau a world-leading centre for synthetic geometry. Staude was a student of\nFelix Klein\n's in Leipzig, graduating in\n1881\n. He habilitated at Breslau in\n1883\nand remained there until\n1886\n. He worked on analytical geometry.\nIn addition to studying mathematics, Landsberg's other main subject at Breslau was physics which he was taught by Oskar Emil Meyer\n(1834\n-\n1909)\n, Felix Auerbach\n(1856\n-\n1933)\n, and Joachim Leonhard Weber\n(1848\n-\n1919)\n. Meyer was Professor of Mathematics and Theoretical Physics at Breslau from\n1866\n, remaining there for the rest of his career. He worked on the viscosity of gasses. Auerbach became an assistant to Oskar Emil Meyer at the physics department of the University of Breslau in\n1879\nthen, in\n1880\n, he became a lecturer there and remained until\n1899\n. His thesis was\nThe nature of vocal sounds\n. J L Weber was a full professor of Theoretical Physics at the University of Breslau. He worked on lightning.\nAlthough Landsberg's main topics at Breslau were mathematics and physics, he also studied a wide range of other topics. The other subject which he took several courses on was philosophy. He took philosophy courses with Jacob Freudenthal\n(1839\n-\n1907)\n, Theodor Hubert Weber\n(1836\n-\n1906)\n, and Benno Erdmann\n(1851\n-\n1921)\n. Freudenthal became a lecturer at Breslau in\n1875\n, was promoted to assistant professor in\n1878\nand to professor\n1888\n. He is famed for his work on Spinoza. T H Weber was Professor of Philosophy at the University of Breslau from\n1872\nto\n1890\n. He worked on metaphysics and Kantian epistemology. Erdmann was a philosopher, logician and psychologist. He was Professor at Breslau from\n1884\n-\n1890\nand worked on Kant but also published an interesting book on the foundations of mathematics\nDie Axiome der Geometrie, eine philosophische Untersuchung der Riemann-Helmholtz'schen Raumtheorie\nâ\n(\nThe axioms of geometry, a philosophical study of the Riemann-Helmholtz theory of space\n)\n(1877)\n.\nAt Breslau, Landsberg also studied astronomy with Johann Gottfried Galle\n(1812\n-\n1910)\nwho had moved to Breslau\n1851\nas Director of the Observatory, becoming Professor of Astronomy there from\n1856\n. He discovered Neptune in\n1846\nusing\nLe Verrier\n's data. At Breslau he worked on exact descriptions of planetary orbits and on comets. Landsberg took a chemistry course with Thomas August Theodor Poleck\n(1821\n-\n1906)\nwho was appointed director of the pharmaceutical institute at the University of Breslau in\n1867\n. He was Dean of the Faculty in\n1887\n-\n88\nand rector of the University in\n1888\n-\n89\n. Landsberg also studied with the biologist Ferdinand Julius Cohn\n(1828\n-\n1898)\nwho worked at Breslau from\n1849\nuntil he retired. He was one of the founders of modern bacteriology and microbiology.\nAt Leipzig Landsberg took a narrower range of courses all within mathematics and physics. He was taught by five mathematicians,\nFelix Klein\n,\nWalther von Dyck\n, Adolf Mayer\n(1839\n-\n1908)\n,\nCarl Neumann\n, and Friedrich Schur\n(1856\n-\n1932)\n.\nKlein\nheld the Chair of Geometry at Leipzig from\n1880\nto\n1886\n,\nvon Dyck\nwas\nKlein\n's assistant at Leipzig from\n1880\n, remaining there until\n1886\n. Mayer habilitated in\n1866\nat the University of Leipzig. There he became an associate professor in\n1871\nand an extraordinary professor in\n1881\n. In\n1882\nMayer became co-director of the mathematical seminar founded by\nFelix Klein\n. From\n1890\nto\n1900\nhe was full professor in Leipzig. His research areas were partial differential equations,\ncalculus of variations\nand analytical mechanics.\nCarl Neumann\nheld the chair at Leipzig from\n1868\n, remaining there until he retired in\n1911\n. He worked on differential and integral equations. Friedrich Schur became an assistant to\nKlein\nat Leipzig in\n1884\n. He studied differential geometry and\nLie\ngroups. The only other lecturer that Landsberg studied with at Leipzig was the physicist Gustav Heinrich Wiedemann\n(1826\n-\n1899)\n. Wiedemann accepted the chair of physical chemistry at Leipzig in\n1871\n, transferring to a professorship in physics in\n1887\n. He is best known for his work in magnetism as well as his achievements as an author.\nLandsberg's doctorate was awarded by the University of Breslau in\n1890\n. His Ph.D. examination was on\n19\nDecember\n1889\nand his Inaugural Dissertation\nUntersuchungen Ã¼ber die Theorie der Ideale\nâ\n(\nStudies on the theory of ideals\n)\nwas defended on Saturday\n29\nMarch\n1890\nat\n11\n:\n00\nin the Aula Leopoldina with opponents Max Hamburger, an assistant in the Physics Institute of the University of Breslau and Hans Seger. Landsberg dedicated his\n60\n-page thesis to \"My dear parents.\"\nFor a list of publications by Landsberg, beginning with his thesis, see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nIn\n1890\nLandsberg went to Berlin where he studied on his own, working towards his habilitation. He joined the teaching staff at the University of Heidelberg in\n1893\n, habilitating on\n29\nApril, and he taught there being promoted to extraordinary professor on\n17\nFebruary\n1897\n. During these seven years he lived at various addresses in Heidelberg:\n1893\n-\n1895\n, Bergheimer Str.\n81\n;\n1896\n, Landhausstr.\n14\n;\n1897\n-\n1902\n, Sandgasse\n5\n(\nfrom\n1901\ndue to renumbering the same house became No.\n9)\n;\n1903\n, PlÃ¶ck\n79\n.\n(\nThe house where Landsberg lived had been built around\n1850\nfor the university's first gymnastics teacher, Dr Karl Wassmannsdorff\n(1821\n-\n1906)\n. In the rear of the building, when Georg Landsberg was living there, Wassmannsdorff ran a private gym\n)\n; and\n1904\n, Hauptstrasse\n118\n.\nIn\n1904\nhe returned to Breslau as extraordinary professor of mathematics, taking up the appointment on\n27\nOctober, but he was only there for two years for he accepted an offer of an extraordinary professorship at the University of Kiel, starting on\n24\nOctober\n1906\n. At Kiel he was promoted to ordinary professor of mathematics in\n1911\nbut sadly he was only to hold this post for a short while since he died the following year. While at Kiel he advised\nJakob Nielsen\nwho matriculated at Kiel in the Spring of\n1908\n.\nIoan James\nwrites\n[\n3\n]\n:-\nAmong his teachers in Kiel,\nJakob Nielsen\nvalued in particular the mathematician Georg Landsberg, known among other things for his work on algebraic functions. It was Landsberg who encouraged\nNielsen\nto study the mathematical problems underlying his doctoral dissertation of\n1913\n. In a short autobiography appended to the thesis, he expresses his devotion to Landsberg, who had died shortly before.\nLandsberg studied the theory of functions of two variables and also the theory of higher dimensional curves. In particular he studied the role of these curves in the calculus of variations and in mechanics. For example his paper\nÃber den Zusammenhang der KrÃ¼mmungstheorie der Curven mit der Mechanik starrer Systeme des n-dimensionalen Raumes\nâ\n(\nAbout the connection between the curvature theory of curves and the mechanics of rigid systems in n-dimensional space\n)\n(1897)\ngeneralises\nFrenet\n-\nSerret\n. He worked with ideas related to those of\nWeierstrass\n,\nRiemann\nand\nHeinrich Weber\non theta functions and Gaussian sums. His most important work, however was his contribution to the development of the theory of algebraic functions of a single variable. Here he studied the\nRiemann\n-\nRoch\ntheorem. He was able to combine\nRiemann\n's function theoretic approach with the Italian geometric approach and with the\nWeierstrass\narithmetical approach. His arithmetic setting of this result led eventually to the modern abstract theory of algebraic functions.\nOne of his most important works was the book\nTheorie der algebraischen Funktionen einer Varaiblen\nâ\n(\nTheory of the algebraic functions of a variable\n)\n(\nLeipzig,\n1902)\nwhich he wrote jointly with\nKurt Hensel\n. This work remained the standard text on the subject for many years. As an indication of its importance, we note that it was reprinted in\n1965\n. Leo Corry writes\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nIn\n1902\nKurt Hensel\nco-authored with Georg Landsberg a book on the theory of algebraic functions which became a classic in its field. This book, which the authors dedicated to\nDedekind\n, attempted to summarise the vast amount of research conducted in the field during the preceding four decades, and especially the contributions of\nWeierstrass\n,\nKronecker\n,\nDedekind\nand Weber. In particular the influence of\nDedekind\nand Weber's\n1882\njoint article is pervasive throughout the book;\nHensel\nand Landsberg explicitly pointed out the close connections with the theory of algebraic numbers, that had characterised the latest development of the field presented in their book. And yet, the book presented a very-well balanced combination of\nDedekind\n's and of\nKronecker\n's respective approaches, in the relevant sections. The approach developed by\nHensel\nand Landsberg displays very clearly the close attachment of\nDedekind\n's images of mathematical knowledge to those characteristic of nineteenth-century algebra. It showed the extent to which the ideas contained in\nDedekind\n's work could be further developed, without necessarily leading to the structural approach that later developed in algebra.\nLet us note that the book is \"dedicated to\nRichard Dedekind\non the occasion of\n18\nMarch\n1902\n(\nthe fiftieth anniversary of his doctorate\n)\nin the greatest reverence.\"\nIn January\n1911\nLandsberg, at that time an extraordinary professor at Kiel, had been invited to be the successor to\nMoritz Pasch\nin the chair of mathematics at the University of Giessen. It was this call to Giessen that prompted the University of Kiel to promote Landsberg to an ordinary professorship. He was, at this time, a scholar with a very high reputation, and it was felt that he had a great future ahead of him as a leading researcher. His death in\n1912\ncame as a blow to the University of Kiel and as a huge loss to the world of mathematics.",
