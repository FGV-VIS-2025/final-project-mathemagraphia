  "biografia": "Henri Fehr\nwas the son of Heinrich Fehr and Lina Scheller. Fehr attended secondary school in Geneva. His university studies were carried out at several different universities. He began by taking courses at the University of Geneva, continued at the Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich before going to the Sorbonne in Paris, where he obtained the degree of 'licence Ã¨s sciences mathÃ©matiques'Â in\n1892\n. He began to undertake research and published his first paper\nRemarque sur le thÃ©orÃ¨me de M Moutard\nâ\n(\nNote on a theorem of  Moutard\n)\nin\n1894\n. His second paper\nSur l'emploi de la multiplication extÃ©rieure en algÃ¨bre\nâ\n(\nOn the use of exterior multiplication in algebra\n)\nwas published in the following year. In this work he extended methods of exterior multiplication developed by Emmanuel Carvallo to methods of resolution and elimination for systems of linear equations. The importance of these methods for the theory of invariants is also explained with reference to the work of Grassmann and Schlegel.\nFrom\n1895\nto\n1900\n, Fehr taught at the Ãcole Professionnelle and at the College of Geneva and, at the same time, he gave a course at the University as a\ndocent\n. Remarkably, at this very early stage in his career, he founded the Mathematical Library\n[\n5\n]\n:-\nHenri Fehr, at the very beginning of his career in\n1897\n, founded the Mathematical Library, which he administered until his last years with particular care, taking advantage of all the opportunities to enrich it despite very limited funds, carefully avoiding all that could have diminished it.\nDuring these five years, in addition to the heavy teaching duties, he prepared his doctoral dissertation. He submitted his thesis\nApplication de la mÃ©thode vectorielle de Grassmann Ã  la gÃ©omÃ©trie infinitÃ©simale\nâ\n(\nApplication of the Grassmann vector method to infinitesimal geometry\n)\nto the University of Geneva and he successfully defended it in\n1899\n. This thesis was published as a book in Paris, also in\n1899\n, and reviewed by\nEdwin Wilson\nwho writes\n[\n12\n]\n:-\nAs a thesis, the work contains nothing original either in vector analysis or in geometry. All the results and methods were known well enough before. ... The presentation of the elements of differential geometry given by M Fehr is hardly to be excelled. The usual important and fundamental results are obtained in much less space and time than is customary, and yet with perhaps a gain instead of a loss in clearness. ...\nFor a list of contents in the form of chapter and section headings of the thesis as well as a longer extract from\nEdwin Wilson\n's review, see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nJacques Hadamard\nwas impressed with Fehr's thesis and wrote in Volume\n19\nof the\nRevue gÃ©nÃ©rale des Sciences pures el appliquÃ©es\n:-\nWhat is certain is that M Fehr has produced a small treatise on infinitesimal geometry in which the exposition is of rare elegance and simplicity.\nIn addition to his thesis, Fehr published a further three articles in\n1899\n, namely:\nSur l'enseignement des Ã©lÃ©ments de trigonomÃ©trie\nâ\n(\nOn teaching the elements of trigonometry\n)\n;\nLa prÃ©paration mathÃ©matique de l'actuaire\nâ\n(\nThe mathematical preparation of the actuary\n)\n; and\nSur la courbure moyenne quadratique\nâ\n(\nOn quadratic mean curvature\n)\n. Yet another of his achievements in\n1899\nwas his founding, with Charles-Ange Laisant, of a new journal\nL'enseignement mathÃ©matique\nwhich had the subtitle\nRevue internationale, paraissant toutes les deux mois\n. The first volume of the journal appeared in\n1899\nwith Fehr as editor and, remarkably, he continued to edit the journal for over\n50\nyears until his death in\n1954\n. Fehr and Laisant wrote in the first issue:-\nAt a time when science has made so much progress, some simplifications may be desirable, the programmes of the different branches of teaching require more or less complete reforms. Linked to this there is a fundamental issue whose importance should not be overlooked: namely that of the education of teachers. All these changes ought not to be carried out in an abrupt way, nor without serious preliminary reflections. But is not the first requirement for proceeding in such a study in a judicious and fruitful way, to be aware of what happens in other countries, to know the way mathematics teaching is organised in each of them, what teaching programmes are in force, the methods by which the studies are approved, etc.? ... Despite the strong rapport that has been established today among scientists of the same field, despite the international congresses of mathematicians, so brilliantly inaugurated in Zurich in\n1897\nand accepted as a principle for the future, the world of education proper has not up to now been able to join this great movement of scientific solidarity as fully as would have been desirable ... . It has been our wish, through the publication of our Journal, to overcome the obstacles to reciprocal communications and to create a kind of continuous mutual correspondence between men who have devoted their lives to this noble mission: the mathematical education of young people. In view of this aim, our first concern has been to give this periodical a clearly and openly international character.\nA list of the members of the first Committee for the journal shows that support it received from leading mathematicians worldwide:\nPaul Emile Appell\n,\nNicolai Vasilievich Bugaev\n,\nMoritz Benedikt Cantor\n,\nLuigi Cremona\n,\nEmanuel Czuber\n, Zoel GarcÃ­a de Galdeano y Yanguas,\nAlfred George Greenhill\n,\nFelix Klein\n, Valerian Nikolaevich Ligin,\nPaul Mansion\n,\nGÃ¶sta Magnus Mittag-Leffler\n, Gabriel Oltramare,\nJulius Peter Christian Petersen\n,\nÃmile Charles Picard\n,\nHenri Jules PoincarÃ©\n,\nPieter Hendrik Schoute\n, Kyparissos Stephanos,\nFrancisco Gomes Teixeira\n, Alexandr Vasil'evich Vasil'ev, Alexander Ziwet.\nIn\n1904\n, in the sixth volume of the journal, Fehr and Laisant wrote:-\nThe word 'Enseignement' has for us the widest possible meaning. It means the teaching of pupils, as well as the teaching of teachers - and, indeed, you can hardly have the one without the other.\nThe journal rapidly became successful and in\n1905\n, when it was only six years old, it was awarded a gold medal at the International Exhibition in Brussels.\nFehr was appointed as an ordinary professor of Algebra and Higher Geometry at the University of Geneva on\n24\nJuly\n1900\n, a position he held until\n1945\n. The chair had become vacant due to Gabriel Oltramare\n(1816\n-\n1906)\nretiring after fifty-two years as a teacher. Fehr wrote the obituary\n[\n4\n]\nfor Gabriel Oltramare. We note that Oltramare was one of the organisers of the first International Congress of Mathematicians held in Zurich in\n1897\nwhich Fehr also attended.\nIn fact Fehr had the remarkable record of attending every International Congress of Mathematicians from this first in\n1897\nuntil the\n1950\nCongress. He gave the invited talk\nL'enquÃªte de \"l'Enseignement MathÃ©matique\" sur la mÃ©thode de travail des mathÃ©maticiens\nâ\n(\nThe investigation of 'Mathematical Education' on the working method of mathematicians\n)\nat the\n1904\nHeidelberg Congress, and was chairman of one of the sessions. In\n1908\n, at the Rome Congress, he gave the talk\nLes mathÃ©matiques dans l'enseignement secondaire en Suisse\nâ\n(\nMathematics in secondary education in Switzerland\n)\n. This Congress was important for Fehr's career as Guillermo Curbera explains in\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nAn idea conceived by\nDavid Eugene Smith\nfrom New York was then discussed and presented to the general assembly of the congress, where it was approved with lively applause: \"The Congress, recognizing the importance of a thorough examination of the programs and of the methods of teaching mathematics at secondary schools of different nations, charges Professors\nKlein\n,\nGreenhill\n, and Fehr to constitute an InternationalÂ Commission to study these questions and to report to the next Congress.\" Thus, the origins of the Commission Internationale de L'Enseignement MathÃ©matique, also known by its English name International Commission on Mathematical Instruction\n(\nbriefly, ICMI\n)\n, lay in the attention paid to educational issues at the Rome congress. The commission was linked from its beginning to the journal 'L'Enseignement MathÃ©matique', founded in\n1899\n, which since then has been its official journal.\nFehr presented the printed report on the work of the International Commission on the Teaching of Mathematics to the\n1912\nCongress held in Cambridge, England, as well as presenting the reports of Denmark, Greece, Russia, Finland and Switzerland. Curbera writes\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nThe congress expressed its appreciation for the impressiveÂ work done by the International Commission on the Teaching of Mathematics, led by its oddly entitled Central Committee\n(\nformed by\nF Klein\n,\nA Greenhill\n, and H Fehr\n)\nwith the aid of\nD E Smith\n. They reported that \"every country in nearly every part of the world has contributed in its own department to the Reports for Cambridge - so that there were about\n150\ndifferent volumes with about\n300\narticles brought to the Congress.\"\nHe was Vice-President of the\n1924\nCongress held in Toronto, and gave the talk\nL'UniversitÃ© et la prÃ©paration des professeurs de mathÃ©matiques\nâ\n(\nThe University and the preparation of mathematics teachers\n)\n. For the\n1932\nCongress held in Zurich he was a member of the Organising Committee. He was President of Section XIII for the\n1936\nCongress in Oslo.\nAs well as editing\nL'Enseignement mathÃ©matique\nFehr contributed many articles to it. Fluvia Furinghetti writes\n[\n3\n]\n:-\nThe main contribution of Fehr as author of articles in the journal was in the field of mathematics instruction. He singled out some central points, such as:\n(\ni\n)\ninnovations in the mathematical programmes and their links with the development of science and technology, as an echo of what was happening in many countries;\n(\nii\n)\nthe relationship between pure and applied mathematics and its influence on the mathematics teaching;\n(\niii\n)\nthe education of mathematics teachers; and\n(\niv\n)\nnew trends in mathematics teaching.\nAs an example, here are the titles of five papers that he published in\nL'Enseignement mathÃ©matique\nin\n1904\n:\nUn hyperbolographe Ã  liquide\nâ\n(\nA liquid apparatus for drawing hyperbolae'\n)\n;\nLes Ã©tudes mathÃ©matiques Ã  l'Ãcole Normale de l'UniversitÃ© Columbia de New York\nâ\n(\nMathematical studies at the Normal School of Columbia University in New York\n)\n;\nRapport et dÃ©cret concernant la nouvelle organisation de l'Ãcole Normale SupÃ©rieure de Paris\nâ\n(\nReport and decree concerning the new organization of the Ecole Normale Superieure in Paris\n)\n;\nLeÂ\n3\neÂ congrÃ¨s international des mathÃ©maticiens; les expositions de bibliographie et de modÃ¨les et instruments\nâ\n(\nThe\n3\nrd International Congress of Mathematicians; the bibliography and models and instruments exhibitions\n)\n; and\nGeorge Salmon\n. These were all written in French except\nGeorge Salmon\n's obituary which was written in German.\nIn\n1907\nFehr married Mathilda Elisabetha Merkling.\nThe outbreak of World War I in\n1914\ncreated severe problems for Fehr in his international efforts supporting the teaching of mathematics. He wrote in\n1914\nin\nL'Enseignement mathÃ©matique\n:-\nThe European war carries with it an appreciable impact on international institutions. In the fighting countries and in the neighbouring neutral countries all those whom the nation considers to be able-bodied are in uniform. Thus it becomes practically impossible to continue with activities requiring the support of numerous collaborators. Peaceful activities like ours have to take second place. Furthermore, being in pursuit of a freely chosen common ideal, they demand a willingness for unity, which ought not to be asked of scientists in a period as troubled as the one in which we are living now.\nHeinrich Behnke\nspoke about Fehr's contributions to the teaching of mathematics at the symposium dedicated to the memory of Henri Fehr which was held on\n1\n-\n2\nJuly\n1955\nin Geneva. For extracts from his talk, see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nGeorges Tiercy spoke at the same symposium about Fehr's approach to teaching. For extracts from his talk, see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nOn\n4\nSeptember\n1910\n, at an annual meeting of the Swiss Society of Natural Sciences, in collaboration with\nRudolf Fueter\nand\nMarcel Grossmann\n, he founded the\nSwiss Mathematical Society\n. He was the second president of the Society from\n1913\nto\n1915\n,\nFueter\nbeing the first\n(1910\n-\n1912)\nand\nGrossmann\nthe third\n(1916\n-\n1917)\n. Urs Stammbach writes in\n[\n10\n]\n:-\nOver time, the scientific demands of mathematics grew, and the lack of a Swiss publication for scientific mathematical work became painfully obvious. In the course of the\n1920\ns, the plan arose for the Society to found its own journal. The project was prepared by H Fehr together with some former presidents of the Society. Because of Switzerland's multilingualism, it was clear from the start that neither a German nor a French title could be considered; for this reason, a Latin name was sought, with 'Commentarii Mathematici Helvetici' being selected from three different proposals.\nWe followed Fehr's career as far as his appointment as ordinary professor of Algebra and Higher Geometry at the University of Geneva in\n1900\n. Let us briefly note that he was Dean of the Faculty of Science from\n1914\nto\n1922\n, and again from\n1926\nto\n1928\n. He was vice-rector of the University of Geneva from\n1928\nto\n1930\n, then as rector from\n1930\nto\n1932\n. In\n1945\nhe reached the age of\n75\nso had to retire. He was appointed as an honorary professor at this time. We see from these details that during World War I, he was the Dean and he was still in post during World War II. In World War I he was president of the Geneva Committee of the Swiss Academic Work for student prisoners of war. For this work Fehr was made Chevalier de la LÃ©gion d'honneur and awarded the French MÃ©daillÃ© de la Reconnaissance in recognition for the services he rendered to internees. In\n1940\n, during World War II, he was rector of a Faculty of Science set up in the Berthoud camp where French and Polish internees were held. Lectures were organised for the prisoners.\nThe author of\n[\n5\n]\nwrites:-\nWe saw him continuing almost until his last days to come to the University on every occasion and in particular to the Mathematical Library, missing neither a Dies Academicus, nor an opening session, or strolling in his peaceful neighbourhood of Florissant where he welcomed his friends so well. We had become accustomed to seeing him very alert and always finding on his face that expression of gentleness and deep kindness. The University has kept the memory of a dean, a vice-rector and a rector concerned with good administration and admirable management of university funds. It also remembers his personality, attentive to human problems and above all to the intellectual and moral development of his students, who have shown him on many occasions their gratitude for his understanding, kindness and delicacy. With regard to his colleagues, his dedication has been actively exercised on the Pension Fund Committee.\nAs one would expect, given Fehr's passion for teaching, he played a leading role in the Swiss Association of Mathematics Teachers, which he chaired from\n1905\nto\n1909\n. He also spent\n20\nyears working for the\nEuler\nCommission, which was set up to organise the publication of\nLeonhard Euler\n's works.\nFinally, let us quote from Fehr concerning the qualities he thought a teacher should have\n[\n5\n]\n:-\nIt is necessary that the teacher, giving his lesson, be extremely attentive to the visible reactions on the faces of the students; according to the nature of these reactions, he must be able to change completely, and at the same time keeping pace with his explanations; in other words, he must not be a prisoner of the prepared lesson.",
