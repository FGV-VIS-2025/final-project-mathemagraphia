  "biografia": "Stanislaw Saks\nwas born into a Jewish family, his parents being the clerk Filip Salomon Saks\n(\nborn in Kalisz on\n4\nMay\n1872)\nand Anna Emma Labez Bosak\n(\nborn\n1870)\n. Filip and Anna had been married in\n1890\nand they had two sons, Stanislaw Saks, the subject of this biography, and Wincenty Saks\n(\nborn in Kalisz on\n26\nMay\n1904)\n.\nStanislaw was born in Kalisz in west-central Poland, not in Warsaw as stated in\n[\n1\n]\n. He began his education in\n1905\nat a primary school in Kalisz, then after two years his parents moved to Warsaw and, in\n1907\n, he continued his education at the Michal Kreczmar junior high school in Warsaw. To understand why this school was so important in his upbringing, we should look at a little Polish history to explain just why this was so special.\nPoland had been partitioned in\n1772\nwith the south called Galicia and under Austrian control while Russia controlled much of the rest of the country, in particular the Warsaw region. In a policy implemented between\n1869\nand\n1874\n, all state secondary schooling had to be conducted in the Russian language. The University of Warsaw was closed by the Russian administration in\n1869\nand from then until World War I there were no Polish language universities.\nSchool education was difficult in Russian controlled Poland at this time. Beginning in autumn of\n1904\nthere were school strikes as pupils and their parents protested against school teaching being in Russian and pupils being even forbidden to speak Polish in school. When school strikes occurred, the Russian authorities reacted by closing the school. It appears that the Russian authorities were happy to close schools and keep illiteracy in Poland as high as possible. The Jan Kreczmar high school, a private secondary school, was founded in\n1907\nby Jan Kreczmar. The Russians allowed private Polish schools, but their number was limited and they were subject to frequent inspections. The school taught in Polish and was run by teachers affiliated to the Society of Polish Culture who created a patriotic atmosphere and made the pupils sensitive to social problems. Many students of this school later played a large role in the socialist movement in the country. After the death of Jan Kreczmar, his brother Michal ran the school and it became known as the Michal Kreczmar High School. Saks completed his studies at this school and received his high school diploma in\n1915\n.\nIn August\n1915\nthe Russian forces, which had held Poland for many years, withdrew from Warsaw. Germany and Austria-Hungary took control of most of the country and a German governor general was installed in Warsaw. One of the first moves after the Russian withdrawal was the refounding of the University of Warsaw and it began operating as a Polish university in November\n1915\n. Saks entered the newly refounded university on this occasion of great rejoicing for all patriotic Poles. He was taught algebra in his first year of studies by\nSamuel Dickstein\n.\nKazimierz Kuratowski\ntells us in\n[\n3\n]\nthat:-\n... in a short time\n[\nSaks\n]\nshone as one of the most talented students of mathematics. Mathematical analysis, and especially those of its branches which used modern methods of set theory and topology, became his main field of interest.\nIn addition to\nDickstein\n, two of Saks' first teachers at the University of Warsaw were\nZygmunt Janiszewski\nand\nStefan Mazurkiewicz\nwho both began teaching there when the university reopened in November\n1915\n. One of Saks' fellow students was\nKazimierz Kuratowski\nwho wrote\n[\n3\n]\n:-\nAs early asÂ\n1917\nÂ\n[\nJaniszewski\nÂ and\nMazurkiewicz\n]\nÂ were conducting aÂ topologyÂ seminar, presumably the first in that new, exuberantly developing field. The meeting of that seminar, taken up to a large extent with sometimes quite vehement discussions between\nJaniszewski\nÂ and\nMazurkiewicz\n, were a real intellectual treat for the participants.\nThe ZNMS\n(\nUnion of Independent Socialist Youth\n)\nwas founded in\n1917\nby university students in Cracow, Warsaw and LwÃ³w. It both supported the economic interests of students and undertook educational work. Saks was one of the founders of the Union. Saks became an editor of its paper \"Independent Voice\". Later he became a member of the Polish Socialist Party\n(\nPPS\n)\nand wrote articles for\nRobotnik\n, the newspaper of the PPS, under the pseudonym \"Zygfryd\".\nAt the Paris Peace Conference in\n1919\nPoland demanded the return of the former Prussian sector of Upper Silesia from Germany. There had already been an uprising against the Germans in December\n1918\nin Poznan. The Treaty of Versailles was signed in the summer of\n1919\nand it gave Poland part, but not all, of the Prussian sector. There were three insurrections in Upper Silesia as the Polish population rebelled against the German administration. Saks took a break from his studies in\n1919\n-\n21\nserving in the Polish Army and participating in a plebiscite campaign in Upper Silesia which yielded mixed results. He participated in the insurrections; he was a member of the PPS Combat Organisation\n[\nOrganizacja Bojows\n]\nin the Third Silesian Uprising which began in May\n1921\n. He was awarded the Cross of Valour for his patriotic actions.\nIn\n1921\nSaks' first mathematics paper,\nSur l'Ã©quivalence de deux thÃ©orÃ¨mes de la thÃ©orie des ensembles\nâ\n(\nOn the equivalence of two theorems of set theory\n)\n, was published in the second volume of\nFundamenta Mathematicae.\nHe begins the paper as follows:-\nIn a note \"Un thÃ©orÃ¨m sur les ensembles fermÃ©s\"\nâ\n(\nA theorem on closed sets\n)\n(1918)\nM\nSierpinski\nshows without the aid of\nZermelo\n's axiom a generalisation of Cantor's Durchschnittssatz. We propose showing that the said theorem of\nSierpinski\nis equivalent to\nBorel\n's theorem and that this equivalence is valid in more general \"spaces\".\nSaks continued to study mathematics for his doctorate, returning to the University of Warsaw on\n21\nNovember\n1921\n. His thesis advisor was\nMazurkiewicz\nbut, as well as his supervisor, he was greatly influenced by\nSierpinski\nwho was appointed to the university in\n1919\nand began to work closely with\nMazurkiewicz\n. In\n1920\nMazurkiewicz\nand\nSierpinski\nhad became editors of\nFundamenta Mathematicae\nand Polish mathematics was flourishing. Certainly, therefore, it was an exciting period during which Saks embarked on a research career and he was awarded his doctorate on\n26\nOctober\n1922\n, Cum Laude Maxima, for the thesis\nA contribution to the theory of surfaces and plane domains\n.\nSaks' second paper was written in collaboration with Aleksander Rajchman\n(1890\n-\n1940)\n. Like Saks, Rajchman was born in the Polish part of the Russian Empire into a Jewish family. After being educated in Paris, he returned to Poland in\n1919\nas an assistant at the University of Warsaw. After the award of a doctorate from LwÃ³w with\nHugo Steinhaus\nas his advisor he was appointed to the University of Warsaw in\n1922\n. We note at this point that Rajchman died in the Sachsenhausen concentration camp in the summer of\n1940\n. The Saks-Rajchman joint paper was\nSur la dÃ©rivabilitÃ© des fonctions monotones\nâ\n(\nOn the derivability of monotonic functions\n)\n(1923)\n. They write:-\nThe point of this note is to give a simple elementary proof of a theorem of M\nLebesgue\n, according to which any monotonic function is almost everywhere derivable, and to the theorem of M\nFubini\n, according to which a convergent series of non-decreasing functions can be almost everywhere differentiated term by term.\nIn\n1924\nSaks published a number of papers:\nSur les nombres dÃ©rivÃ©s des fonctions\nâ\n(\nOn numbers derived from functions\n)\n;\nSur un thÃ©orÃ¨me de M Lusin\nâ\n(\nOn a theorem of M. Lusin\n)\n;\nSur l'homÃ©omorphie des variÃ©tÃ©s deux dimensions\nâ\n(\nOn the homeomorphy of two-dimensional manifolds\n)\n;\n(\nwith\nAntoni Zygmund\n)\nSur les faisceaux des tangentes Ã  une courbe\nâ\n(\nOn the bundle of the tangents to a curve\n)\n; and\nSur l'homÃ©omorphie des variÃ©tÃ©s Ã  deux dimensions\nâ\n(\nOn the homeomorphy of two-dimensional manifolds\n)\n. They were all published in\nFundamenta Mathematicae.\nThe last of these papers consisted of material from his thesis. He writes:-\nThis Memoir comprises the first part, slightly modified, of my thesis presented in the month of May\n1922\nto the University of Warsaw to obtain the degree of doctor of philosophy.\nHe gives the following acknowledgements in this paper:-\nBefore finishing it, allow me here to address my affectionate thanks to MM\nMazurkiewicz\nand\nSierpinski\n, the professors at the University of Warsaw who were kind enough to guide the beginnings of this work, and MM\nKnaster\nand\nKuratowski\nwhose help was so precious for the writing of this Memoir. It is to M\nKuratowski\n, who was kind enough to take an interest in this work, that I owe a special gratitude for the simplifications that he was able to bring to several of my statements as well as for the bibliographical information from which I took great advantage.\nEven before the doctorate was awarded, Saks began teaching at Warsaw Technical University and from\n1926\nhe also lectured at the University of Warsaw after he\nhabilitated\nthere on\n22\nOctober\n1926\n. The following year, from\n7\nto\n10\nSeptember, he attended the First Polish Mathematical Congress held at LwÃ³w as part of the Warsaw contingent and lectured to the conference.\nSteinhaus\nrecalls a contribution Saks made around the same time\n(\nsee for example\n[\n4\n]\n)\n:-\nIn\n1927\n, a collaboration\n[\nbetween\nSteinhaus\nand\n]\nBanach\nresulted in a paper \"Sur le principe de la condensation des singularitÃ©s\"\nâ\n(\nOn the principle of the condensation of singularities\n)\npublished in 'Fundamenta Mathematicae'. ... Stanislaw Saks helped edit the paper and later deepened the result by introducing in its proof the notion of category. This helped make the paper an important contribution to the Polish success between the two wars in the area of functional operations ....\nSaks married the school teacher Zofia Karolina Korzeniowski\n(11\nSeptember\n1902\n, Warsaw -\n3\nJune\n1992\n, Warsaw\n)\n. Zofia was the daughter of Mieczyslaw Maksymilian Korzeniowski\n(1870\n-\n1908)\nand Maria Aniela Fiszer\n(1872\n-\n1938)\n. Stanislaw and Zofia Saks had one son, Marek Saks.\nBanach\nand Saks collaborated on a joint paper\nSur la convergence forte dans le champ\nL\np\nL^{p}\nL\np\nâ\n(\nOn the strong convergence in the field L\np\n)\n. Published in\n1930\n[\n2\n]\n:-\n... the paper addressed the problem of summability in abstract spaces. This gave birth to a class of spaces that are still actively studied and that are now called spaces with the\nBanach\n-Saks property.\nSaks continued to teach at both Warsaw institutions until\n1939\n. However, he did spend a year, namely academic year\n1931\n-\n32\n, in the United States on a visit financed through a Rockefeller scholarship. He sailed from Hamburg, Germany, on the ship President Roosevelt, arriving in New York on\n11\nSeptember\n1931\n. He spent most of his time in the United States at Brown University where he worked with\nJacob David Tamarkin\n. The work they did together led to their joint paper\nOn a Theorem of Hahn-Steinhaus\nwhich was published in the\nAnnals of Mathematics\nin\n1933\n.\nAntoni Zygmund\nhad become a colleague and friend of Saks early in his career. He was appointed to Warsaw Technical University shortly after Saks began to lecture there, and the two began to collaborate on mathematical projects. One of the works for which Saks is most famous is their joint book\nAnalytic functions\nwhich appeared in\n1938\nas volume eight in the\nMathematical Monographs\nseries. This book received a prize from the\nPolish Academy of Sciences\nin the year it was published. This was not Saks' first monograph, however, for he had already published an important volume in the\nMathematical Monographs\nseries. This earlier volume, the volume two in the series published in Polish in\n1930\nand in French in\n1933\n, was his famous work\nTheory of the integral\n. This monograph was based on lecture courses Saks had given at the University of Warsaw. Hawkins, in\n[\n1\n]\n, writes:-\nIn this highly original work Saks systematically developed the theory of integration and differentiation from the standpoint of countably additive set functions.\nIn\n1937\nan English translation\nTheory of the integral\nwas published with\nBanach\n's article\nThe Lebesgue integral in abstract spaces\nas an appendix. It is quite remarkable that this work should still\n[\nin\n2020]\nbe in print as a Dover Hardback edition of\n2012\nand as a paperback Franklin Classics Trade Press of\n2018\n.\nFor Prefaces to these two books by Saks, see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nFor some extracts of reviews of various editions of these books, see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nWe have already mentioned\nMazurkiewicz\n,\nSierpinski\n, and\nZygmund\nas major influences on Saks. We should mention, in addition, that he was also influenced by\nLuzin\n's work. Saks' contributions, including the important texts mentioned above\n[\n1\n]\n:-\n... involved the theory of real functions, such as problems on the differentiability of functions and the properties of\nDenjoy\n-\nPerron\nintegrals.\nKuratowski\nin\n[\n3\n]\ndescribes of Saks as a teacher:-\nStanislaw Saks was a brilliant lecturer, universally respected and very popular with his colleagues and students.\nZygmund\nalso writes about Saks as a teacher in\n[\n20\n]\n:-\nSaks was an extremely talented lecturer. The precision, clarity and elegance of his style were very attractive and attracted listeners, to which should be added his personal kindness when organising the work and scientific cooperation of students.\nThree times Saks was put forward as a candidate for a mathematics chair. Despite the support of most leading Polish mathematicians the proposal of the Faculty Council of Mathematics and Natural Sciences of the Stefan Batory University of Vilnius was not approved by the Ministry of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development in\n1932\nbecause of lack of funds for the founding a new chair. The application to the Faculty Council of Mathematics and Natural Sciences of the University of Warsaw in\n1936\nran into difficulties due to the growing anti-Semitism and, to avoid further unpleasantness, Saks withdrew the application himself. The next proposal of the Faculty Council of Mathematics and Natural Sciences of the Stefan Batory University of Vilnius in\n1939\nfailed because of the outbreak of war before a decision had been reached.\nWhen war broke out in\n1939\nSaks joined the Polish army and retreated with them to LwÃ³w which was by that time under Russian control. There he worked with\nBanach\nin the Soviet held town for two years, being appointed an extraordinary professor at LwÃ³w University which had been renamed the Ivan Franko University by the Russians. At this time he taught in the Department with\nBanach\nat its head. In LwÃ³w, Saks joined the community of mathematicians working and drinking in the Scottish CafÃ©. He contributed problems to the Scottish Book, the famous book in which the mathematicians working in the CafÃ© entered unsolved problems. One problem on subharmonic functions was entered into the Book by Saks on\n8\nFebruary\n1940\nwith the promise of a kilo of bacon to the first person to solve it!\nYou can see more about the Scottish CafÃ© at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nHugo Steinhaus\nwrites about these times in\n[\n4\n]\n:-\nAlthough our Soviet \"guests\" needed a lot of coaching before they acquired some manners - such as removing their caps at appropriate times - it must be admitted that they got the university machine up and running. They made\nBanach\nDean of the Division of Mathematics and Natural Sciences, and thanks to his belief that cooperation was optimal in our situation, he managed to get Saks and\nKnaster\nappointed professors - not an easy thing to do since the Soviets seemed to have an innate dislike of people from Warsaw. The heads of the departments in the Division were\nBanach\n,\nSchauder\n, Zarzycki,\nMazur\nand I, while the extraordinary professors - that is, without departments under them - were Saks,\nKnaster\n, Chwistek, Jacob, Auerbach, and\nOrlicz\n. Our\ndocents\nwere Eidelheit,\nSzpilrajn\n[\nMarczewski\n]\n, and Wojdyslawaki. This represented a powerful collection of mathematicians, and in normal times such a team would have achieved a great deal. Of course, the\nPolish Mathematical Society\nwas no more, but the mathematicians of the division continued the scientific meetings informally. We also managed to bring out Volume IX of 'Studia Mathematica', with the slight modification that each paper now had to include a Ukrainian summary. Following\nLavrentiev\n's visit, a number of us -\nBanach\n, Zarycki,\nSchauder\n,\nMazur\n, Saks and I - became corresponding members of the Kiev Academy of Sciences, a smart move, in particular since it entitled each of us to a payment of a few hundred rubles a month, which, supplemented with our university salaries, enabled us to live tolerably well.\nIn June\n1941\nthe German army entered LwÃ³w and a systematic extermination of Jews began. Saks returned to Warsaw where he was arrested, put in prison and killed by the Gestapo\n(\nallegedly while attempting to escape from prison\n)\n.\nZygmund writes in the Preface to the English edition of\nAnalytic functions\n(1952)\n:-\nStanislaw Saks was a man of moral as well as physical courage, of rare intelligence and wit. To his colleagues and pupils he was an inspiration not only as a mathematician but as a human being. In the period between the two world wars he exerted great influence upon a whole generation of Polish mathematicians in Warsaw and LwÃ³w. In November\n1942\n, at the age of\n45\n, Saks died in a Warsaw prison, victim of a policy of extermination.\nZygmund\nalso writes in\n[\n20\n]\n:-\nSaks left a son Marek and a wife Zofia nÃ©e Korzeniowski. He also left the memory of not only an outstanding scholar, but also an extremely noble man. For those who knew him closely, he will always be a beautiful memory.",
