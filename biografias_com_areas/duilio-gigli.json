  "biografia": "Duilio Gigli\nwas the son of Torquato Gigli and Anna Belli. Torquato Gigli\n(1845\n-\n1936)\n, born in Sansepolcro, studied chemical science at Pisa and lectured at the University as well as becoming head of the municipal chemical laboratory for many years. He published many scholarly articles contributing to\nChemiker Zeitung\nâ\n(\nChemical News\n)\nfor over\n25\nyears. He was a lecturer in pharmaceutical and toxicological chemistry at the University of Pavia. He had a great love of music and poetry as well as being a staunch Italian patriot. In\n1867\nhe was with Garibaldi and in\n1915\nhe volunteered to fight in the Great War.\nAfter his studies at a classical school in Pavia, Duilio Gigli studied mathematics at the Scuola Normale superiore in Pisa, where he was taught by\nLuigi Bianchi\n. His thesis was the source of the material which he published in his first paper\nSulle superficie elicoidali e rigate dello spazio ellittico\nâ\n(\nOn the helicoidal and striped surfaces of the elliptical space\n)\nin which he presented an extension to the theorems due to\nEugenio Beltrami\non surfaces in elliptical space. The\n7\n-page paper appeared in the\nRendiconti of the Reale Istituto Lombardo di Scienze e Lettere\nâ\n(\nProceddings of the Royal Lombard Institute of Sciences and Letters\n)\nin\n1900\n. Gerhard Hessenberg\n(1874\n-\n1925)\nwrites in a review:-\nAn elegant calculation proves the essential analytic correspondence of the deformation of the ruled surfaces for the elliptical\n(\npositively curved non-Euclidean\n)\nand the Euclidean space. Specifically, a ruled surface can be bent in such a way that a geodesic line becomes straight; the control surface formed by the binormals of a curve of constant torsion can be unwound onto a common helical surface.\nFollowing his doctorate Gigli spent another year undertaking further studies at Pisa; then he was appointed as an assistant at the University of Pisa. He published\nSulle somme di n addendi diversi presi fra i numeri\n1\n,\n2\n, ...,\nm\nm\nm\nâ\n(\nOn the sums of n different additions taken between the numbers\n1\n,\n2\n, ..., m\n)\nin the\nRendiconti del Circolo Matematico di Palermo\nâ\n(\nReports of the Mathematical Circle of Palermo\n)\nin\n1902\n.\nEdmund Landau\nwrites in a review of this paper:-\nHow many of the combinations of\nn\nn\nn\nintegers from\n1\nto\nm\nm\nm\nhave the same sum\ns\ns\ns\n, and how many have a sum â¤\nL\nL\nL\n? With the help of a generating function, the author solves these problems in a simple way.\nFor a list of Gigli's publications, see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nWhat follows is based fairly closely on a translation of\n[\n5\n]\nbut we have added extra material.\nFrom\n1910\nGigli taught at the Foscolo High School in Pavia, then at Portoferraio, ForlÃ¬, Sondrio and finally at Sassari in Sardinia before returning again to the Foscolo di Pavia\n(\nwhere he was also vice-president\n)\n. The High School was named for Ugo Foscolo\n(1778\n-\n1827)\na famous Italian writer and poet; it specialised in a classical education.\nThus he divided his activity between that of research and of teaching which absorbed most of his energy. In fact, he had three promotions for distinguished merit in teaching and the inclusion into the role of honour for his commitment to teaching. He qualified as a lecturer in algebraic analysis when awarded his libero docente\n(\nthe Italian equivalent, which no longer exists, of the habilitation\n)\n. He was for many years a lecturer at the University of Pavia, holding teaching positions in algebra and analytical geometry, in infinitesimal analysis, and in analytic geometry.\nHe was an editor of the\nEnciclopedia delle matematiche elementari\nâ\n(\nEncyclopedia of elementary mathematics\n)\nalong with his two colleagues\nLuigi Berzolari\nand\nGiulio Vivanti\n. For this work he wrote three essays of great historical interest on the foundations of arithmetic and on the concept of number:\nAritmetica generale\nâ\n(\nGeneral arithmetic\n)\n(\nin the first part of the first volume published by Ulrico Hoepli in Milan in\n1929\n, pages\n81\n-\n212)\n,\nAritmetica pratica\nâ\n(\nPractical Arithmetic\n)\n, in collaboration with\nEttore Bortolotti\n(\nin the first part of the first volume published by Ulrico Hoepli in Milan in\n1929\n, pages\n213\n-\n268)\n,\nTeoria della misura\nâ\n(\nTheory of measurement\n)\n, in collaboration with\nLuigi Brusotti\n(\nin the first part of the second volume published by Ulrico Hoepli in Milan in\n1936\n, pages\n119\n-\n174)\n. The topics covered range from natural numbers to absolute numbers, relative numbers and complex numbers, all also all being analysed from a logical point of view, to the problem of numbering using instruments and of numbering systems, to the theory of commensurable and incommensurable quantities with consideration for relations to infinitesimal analysis. Regarding the concept of number, Gigli referred, among the many references, directly to the arithmetic of\nGiuseppe Peano\n, and tried to use his investigations into the fundamentals in his teaching.\nG A Miller\nwrites in\n[\n6\n]\n:-\nThe preparation of an Italian encyclopaedia of elementary mathematics was approved by the Society 'Mathesis' as early as\n1909\n, and the project was then viewed with favour also in other countries so that it seemed desirable to publish a German edition contemporaneously with the original. Active preparation was begun at once and in\n1916\nthe proposed publication was announced in my 'Historical Introduction to Mathematical Literature', as well as in other places. Various obstacles, including the World War, delayed the publication so that the first volume, which is devoted to analysis, was only recently completed after being brought up to date by the authors of the articles contained therein. The remaining two volumes are to treat geometry and applied mathematics respectively. The latter volume is expected to include also a discussion of the teaching and the history of mathematics.\nIn a review of volume\n3\nof this work, written after the death of Gigli,\nRaymond Archibald\nwrites\n[\n1\n]\n:-\n... in\n1930\n, under the editorship of\nLuigi Berzolari\n(1863\n-\n1949)\n,\nGiulio Vivanti\n(1859\n-\n1949)\n, and Duilio Gigli\n(1878\n-\n1933)\n, appeared the first part of the first volume of 'Enciclopedia dette matematiche elementari'; the second part was published in\n1932\n, both parts\n(\neach with its own author index\n)\nmaking a volume of nearly\n1100\npages. This volume, devoted to arithmetic, computation, algebra, and analysis,\n[\nwas\n]\nby\n9\nauthors, ... . The general editorial plan of this volume was also carried out in the second. Only the more fundamental theorems were proved, but there is a constant wealth of bibliographic references where further information may be gleaned.\nFor more detailed reviews of the parts of the Encyclopaedia for which Gigli was an editor, see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nIn the\nLezioni di aritmetica e di algebra elementare\nâ\n(\nArithmetic and elementary algebra lessons\n)\n(\nthree volumes published by Mattei et Co., Pavia in\n1914\n, for use in upper secondary schools\n)\n, he wrote in the Preface to volume\n1\nthat he had \"endeavoured to make the numbers still be numbers of things or ratios of magnitudes to magnitudes\" and of having \"wanted that the relations of equality and inequality of a certain operation to be seen to be done with collections of things or between magnitudes, and the sum of numbers remained the image of a certain operation that can be done with collections of things or with quantities.\" Reviewing this work, Lucien Baatard writes\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nIn the first part of this book, published in June\n1914\n, the author discusses the first five operations of arithmetic, progressions, decimal notation, proportions, and periodic decimal fractions. Wanting to avoid the pitfall of presenting arithmetic as a set of characteristics, he bases his deductions on propositions concerning collections of objects; the study of proportions is preceded by copious considerations of continuous quantities; the number\n0\nis the object of particular care. While paying homage to Professor Gigli's thought effort, we will admit that conciseness is not always the prime quality of his explanations and demonstrations; this may be due to the point of view he wanted to take. His work will be read with interest by mathematicians or teachers already familiar with general arithmetic.\nHe was a contributor to the\nQuestioni riguardanti le matematiche elementari\nâ\n(\nQuestions concerning elementary mathematics\n)\n, edited by\nFederigo Enriques\n, for which he wrote the article\nDei numeri complessi a due e piÃ¹ unitÃ\nâ\n(\nOn complex numbers with two and more units\n)\n. This was published by N Zanichelli in Bologna in\n1912\nand comprised of\n147\npages. Here, after a historical investigation into the origins of the theory of imaginary numbers and an analysis of the fundamental theorem of algebra, he gave an original and general presentation of the theory of numbers in\nn\nn\nn\nunits. He also collaborated in the drafting of some entries for the\nEnciclopedia Italiana\n.\nAmong his publications - of a scientific, didactic and historical-critical nature - the following are still remembered:\nSulle somme di n addendi diversi presi fra i numeri\n1\n,\n2\n,\n..., m\nâ\n(\nOn the sums of n different additions taken between the numbers\n1\n,\n2\n, ..., m\n)\n, in\nReale Rendiconti del Circolo Matematico di Palermo\nâ\n(\nProceedings of the Mathematical Circle of Palermo\n)\n(1902)\n, in which he analysed and solved the problem of how many of the combinations considered will give the same sum, and how many will give a sum not exceeding a certain fixed number;\nLa matematica nei licei\nâ\n(\nMathematics in high schools,\n)\n, in\nRivista d'Italia\n(1905)\n, in which he discussed the programme of reforms and the cultural relevance of mathematical education alongside the humanistic one;\nDei numeri trascendenti\nâ\n(\nOn transcendental numbers\n)\n(1923)\n, in which, through a historical-critical survey, he provided a rigorous treatment of the concept of transcendent number.\nFor a list of Gigli's publications, see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nOf further interest are the\nRiflessioni sui principii dell'aritmetica\nâ\n(\nReflections on the principles of arithmetic\n)\n, in the\nYearbook\nof the Reale Liceo di Pavia\n(1925\n-\n26)\n, where he considered and discussed the ideas of\nEuclid\n,\nRenÃ© Descartes\n,\nAlessandro Padoa\n,\nGottlob Frege\n,\nA N Whitehead\nand\nBertrand Russell\n. In\nDefinizioni in matematica\nâ\n(\nDefinitions in mathematics\n)\n, in the\nYearbook\nof the Reale Liceo di Pavia\n(1926\n-\n27)\n, the logical-epistemological status of definitions in mathematics was finely analysed.",
