  "biografia": "Roy Kerr\nwas born in Kurow, a small town about halfway between Christchurch and the south end of the South Island of New Zealand. He attended St Andrew's College, Christchurch, an independent boarding school which, when Roy attended, was for boys only. While at the College he sat the University Entrance Scholarship examinations in\n1950\n[\n8\n]\n:-\nIn those days Scholarship Mathematics consisted of two papers, and was marked out of\n600\n; Roy got\n298\n. This disappointing result was almost entirely explained by the fact that he'd turned up in the afternoon for one of the papers when it had in fact been scheduled in the morning. Despite this oversight, he did get a scholarship ...\nHe entered Canterbury University College\n(\nnow the University of Canterbury\n)\nin\n1951\nand attended the third year mathematics courses in his first year. However, the College regulations only allowed him to sit the second year examinations at the end of the year. In his second year at the College he was attending the Master's lectures but, despite undertaking this advanced study, he still had time to take part in other activities. He played a lot of billiards during his university career, but he also took part in boxing, representing the College as a light-welterweight in the Easter Tournament of\n1952\n. One of his lecturers at Canterbury College was\nWalter Warwick Sawyer\nwho had specialised in relativity and quantum theory when studying at St John's College, Cambridge.\nSawyer\nwas a major influence on Kerr, but the fact that Kerr was a boxer worried\nSawyer\nwho expressed\n[\n8\n]\n:-\n... alarm and dismay over Roy's pugilism, on the ground that he didn't want the best brain he'd encountered in a student scrambled by a well-thrown punch; but history seems to confirm that Roy came to no lasting harm over it.\nKerr graduated from Canterbury College with an MS Mathematics degree in\n1954\n, then went to the University of Cambridge in England, matriculating at Trinity College in September\n1955\n. He undertook research in relativity, although he was assigned a thesis advisor with no interest in that topic\n[\n7\n]\n:-\nMy nominal supervisor was a particle physicist who had no interest in general relativity.\nHe submitted his doctoral thesis\nEquations of Motion in General Relativity\nin\n1958\nand published the results of the thesis in three papers entitled\nThe\nLorentz\n-covariant approximation method in general relativity\nin\nNuovo Cimento\nin\n1959\n. His own summary of the first of these papers reads:-\nThe\nLorentz\n-covariant approximation method for the field outside a set of localized particles has been analysed. It is found that as well as the usual equations of motion and energy derived by\nEinstein\n,\nInfeld\nand Hoffman for the quasi-static approximation, there are three further equations, the equations of spin, which must be satisfied by the structural parameters of each particle. These equations also appear as surface integral conditions in the quasi-static approximation. Furthermore, it is shown that it is not necessary to expand the mass, dipole, or spin parameters, those introduced into the lowest approximation being the physical particle parameters. It is only the differential equations satisfied by these that change in the higher orders.\nIn this first paper the equations of motion of a pole-dipole particle are calculated to the first approximation, and in the second paper this is continued to the second approximation. In the third paper the method is applied to the combined\nEinstein\n-\nMaxwell\nequations.\nIn\n1958\nKerr became a postdoctoral fellow in Gravitation and Relativistic Theories at Syracuse University in New York State in the United States. There he was a research associate of Peter Bergman who had collaborated with\nEinstein\nat the Institute for Advanced Study. Kerr writes\n[\n7\n]\n:-\nWhile there I was invited to join Joshua Goldberg at the Aeronautical Research Laboratory in Dayton Ohio. There was another relativist at the lab, Dr Joseph Schell, who had studied\nEinstein\n's unified field theory under Vaclav Hlavaty. Josh was about to go on study leave to Europe for a few months, and did not want to leave Joe by himself. Before he left, Josh and I became interested in the new methods that were entering general relativity from differential geometry at that time. ...  In\n1962\nGoldberg and myself attended a month-long meeting in Santa Barbara. It was designed to get mathematicians and relativists talking to each other. Perhaps the physicists learned a lot about more modern mathematical techniques, but I doubt that the geometers learned much from the relativists. All that aside, I met Alfred Schild at this conference. He had just persuaded the Texas state legislators to finance a Center for Relativity at the University of Texas, and had arranged for an outstanding group of relativists to join. These included\nRoger Penrose\nand Ray Sachs, but neither could come immediately and so I was invited to visit for the\n62\n-\n63\nacademic year.\nIt was in\n1963\n, while at the University of Texas, that Kerr made the discovery for which he is best known today.\nStephen Hawking\ndescribes Kerr's discovery in\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nIn\n1963\n, Roy Kerr, a New Zealander, found a set of solutions of the equations of general relativity that described rotating black holes. These \"Kerr\" black holes rotate at a constant rate, their size and shape depending only on their mass and rate of rotation. If the rotation is zero, the black hole is perfectly round and the solution is identical to the\nSchwarzschild\nsolution. If the rotation is non-zero, the black hole bulges outward near its equator\n(\njust as the earth or the sun bulge due to their rotation\n)\n, and the faster it rotates, the more it bulges. So ...  it was conjectured that any rotating body that collapsed to form a black hole would eventually settle down to a stationary state described by the Kerr solution. In\n1970\na colleague and fellow research student of mine at Cambridge, Brandon Carter, took the first step toward proving this conjecture. He showed that, provided a stationary rotating black hole had an axis of symmetry, like a spinning top, its size and shape would depend only on its mass and rate of rotation. Then, in\n1971\n, I proved that any stationary rotating black hole would indeed have such an axis of symmetry. Finally, in\n1973\n, David Robinson at Kings College, London, used Carter's and my results to show that the conjecture had been correct: such a black hole had indeed to be the Kerr solution.\nWe should also quote from\nChandrasekhar\n[\n5\n]\nat this point:-\nIn my entire scientific life, extending over forty-five years, the most shattering experience has been the realization that an exact solution of Einstein's equations of general relativity, discovered by the New Zealand mathematician, Roy Kerr, provides the absolutely exact representation of untold numbers of massive black holes that populate the universe. This shuddering before the beautiful, this incredible fact that a discovery motivated by a search after the beautiful in mathematics should find its exact replica in Nature, persuades me to say that beauty is that to which the human mind responds at its deepest and most profound.\nHere is Kerr's own comments taken from\n[\n6\n]\n:-\nEverybody who tried to solve the problem was going at it from the front, but I was trying to solve the equation from a different point of view - there were a number of new mathematical methods coming into relativity at the time and Josh\n[\nGoldberg\n]\nand I had had some success with these. I was trying to look at the whole structure - the\nBianchi\nidentities, the\nEinstein\nequations and these Tetrads - to see how they fitted together and it all seemed to be pretty nice and it looked like lots of solutions were going to come out. Then I hit a brick wall. Teddy Newman and\nRoger Penrose\nwere working on a similar set of methods, but Teddy had come out with this as-yet unpublished theorem that basically 'proved' that my solution couldn't exist! Luckily, my neighbour, who was playing around with relativity, too, got hold of a preprint and I just scanned through it\n(\nI'm a lazy reader\n)\nand hit the crucial part which proved to me that my solution could exist! After that, I kept working like mad and found the solution in a few weeks.\nKip Thorne, in\n[\n3\n]\n, recalls when Kerr announced his solution in a\n10\n-minute presentation at the Texas Symposium on Relativistic Astrophysics in\n1963\n:-\nThe astronomers and astrophysicists had come to Dallas to discuss quasars and they were not interested in Kerr's esoteric mathematical topic. So, as Kerr got up to speak, many slipped out ... others, less polite, argued in whispers ... many of the rest catnapped. This was more than Achilles Papapetrou, one of the world's leading relativists, could stand. As Kerr finished, Papapetrou demanded the floor, stood up and with deep feeling explained the importance of Kerr's feat. He, Papapetrou, had been trying for\n30\nyears to find such a solution to\nEinstein\n's equation and had failed, as had other relativists.\nIn\n1965\n, in collaboration with Alfred Schild who was a colleague at the University of Texas, Kerr published\nSome algebraically degenerate solutions of Einstein's gravitational field equations\nwhich introduced what are today known as Kerr-Schild spacetimes and the Kerr-Schild metric. Kerr remained at the University of Texas until\n1971\nwhen he returned to New Zealand to a chair at the University of Canterbury. He remained in this chair until he retired in\n1993\n. His greatest influence, however, was from\n1983\nto\n1993\nwhen he was Head of the Department of Mathematics\n[\n8\n]\n:-\nRoy's style as Head of Department was at once uncompromising and dashing; in a series of moves which affronted some of our colleagues in other departments, who had grown comfortable with the traditional Canterbury view that Mathematics should be a low-cost department devoted to service teaching, he contrived to reduce student-staff ratios, encourage research, and equip the department with a computer system at the sort of cost hitherto associated with spectrographs. Morale rose markedly. In many respects Roy was an unusual figure in University administration; he had very little patience for the practice of wrapping self-interest up in politically correct pieties, and was perfectly willing to offend entrenched privilege. But he was successful, and we are the better for his efforts, and we love him for them.\nAmong the many awards that Kerr has received for his remarkable contributions we mention first the Hughes Medal presented by the\nRoyal Society of London\non\n30\nNovember\n1984\nby the President Sir Andrew Huxley. The citation reads:-\nThe Hughes Medal is awarded to Professor R P Kerr in recognition of his distinguished work on relativity, especially for his discovery of the so-called Kerr black hole. In the early\n1960\ns Professor Kerr discovered a specific solution to\nEinstein\n's field equations which describes a structure now termed a Kerr black hole. Not only was the solution especially complex, lacking symmetry of previous solutions, but it became apparent that any stationary black hole can be described by Kerr's solution. His work is therefore of particular importance to general relativistic astrophysics, and all subsequent detailed work on black holes has depended fundamentally on it. Professor Kerr has made other significant contributions to general relativity theory, but the discovery of the Kerr black hole was so remarkable as to compare with the discovery in physics of a new elementary particle.\nThe\nRoyal Society of New Zealand\nawarded Kerr their Hector Medal in\n1982\n. The Rutherford Medal was inaugurated by the\nRoyal Society of New Zealand\nin\n1991\nand the third award was made to Kerr in\n1993\n:-\n... for his contribution to relativity through the Kerr metric.\nThe Kerr Fest, a Symposium on Black Holes in Astrophysics, General Relativity and Quantum Gravity, was held\n26\n-\n28\n, August\n2004\nat the University of Canterbury, Christchurch, to mark Roy Kerr's\n70\nth\nbirthday. At the meeting it was announced that Kerr would receive the Marcel Grossman Award. Kerr received this award in July\n2006\nin Berlin:-\n... for his fundamental contribution to\nEinstein\n's theory of general relativity: \"The gravitational field of a spinning mass as an example of algebraically special metrics.\"\nIt is particularly appropriate that the Marcel Grossman Award consists of a sculpture depicting the path of particles around a Kerr Black Hole.\nRoy Kerr was elected a Fellow of the\nRoyal Society\nin\n2019\n.",
