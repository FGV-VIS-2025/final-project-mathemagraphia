  "biografia": "Ettore Bortolotti\nstudied under Pincherle in Bologna, graduating in\n1889\n. In\n1886\n-\n87\nthe first course on\nGalois\ntheory to be given in Italy was put on at Bologna. Bortolotti, at the time a\n20\nyear old student, attended the course given by\nCesare ArzelÃ\n. The notes which Bortolotti took of that course have survived and are discussed in\n[\n5\n]\n. He became an assistant there and worked at Bologna until\n1891\n. In that year he was appointed to the Lyceum of Modica in Sicily. From\n1892\nhe undertook postgraduate studies at Paris then, in\n1893\n, he was appointed to the University of Rome and taught in Rome until\n1900\nwhen he became professor of\ninfinitesimal\ncalculus at Modena. His teaching at Modena at this time included analysis and rational mechanics.\nBortolotti was Dean of the Faculty at Modena in\n1913\n-\n19\n, then he was appointed professor of geometry at the University of Bologna where he remained for the rest of his life, retiring in\n1936\n. He was an extremely patriotic man; in particular he loved Bologna and it must have been a real joy to him to be able to spend the final part of his career in the University of Bologna where he had begun his studies.\nBortolotti studied\ntopology\nat first but later went in the direction of analysis considering the calculus of finite differences,\ncontinued fractions\n, convergence of infinite algorithms, summation of series, the asymptotic behaviour of series and improper integrals.\nHe was always interested in the history of mathematics studying\nRuffini\n's manuscripts while at Modena, then later editing\nRuffini\n's\nComplete Works\n. Let us look at some of his achievements, and also some of his weaknesses, as a historian of mathematics. First, to put his historical work in context it is useful to see the opinion of Panza in\n[\n7\n]\nand also that of\nDieudonnÃ©\nin his review of\n[\n7\n]\n:-\nThe Italian mathematician Ettore Bortolotti devoted a large part of his activity to the history of Italian mathematics from\n1200\nto\n1800\n. To him is due the discovery of a previously unknown part of\nBombelli\n's 'Algebra', and the edition of\nRuffini\n's complete works. But the author of the paper\n[\n7\n]\nstresses how lopsided and unconvincing were many opinions of Bortolotti on the history of mathematics. They stemmed from his powerful nationalist feelings, which led him\n(\nlong before fascism\n)\nto attribute in every case priority and leadership to Italian mathematicians\n(\nand more particularly to those who worked in Bologna\n)\n, with a corresponding downgrading of the work of their contemporaries. The author of\n[\n7\n]\ndiscusses several examples of this unfortunate tendency, usually supported by unjustified interpretations by Bortolotti of the papers he considered.\nWe should note that Bortolotti published\nRuffini\n's\nComplete Works\nin two volumes, the first in\n1915\n. The second volume was published in\n1943\nbut all except three or four copies of it were destroyed by bombs during World War II. Fortunately it was possible to republish the work in\n1953\nusing photographic methods from one of the surviving copies.\nHe vindicated\nCataldi\n's claim to have discovered continued fractions, after S GÃ¼nther and A Favaro in separate papers, both published in\n1874\n, had found traces of the continued fractions algorithm long before\nCataldi\n. For details of earlier evidence for continued fractions see the\narticle on Bombelli's Algebra\n.\nHowever, in defending the originality of\nCataldi\n, Bortolotti does so in a manner which is not free from partiality. We also note that recent work by Fowler has added much to our understanding of the concept of continued fractions as present in ancient Greek mathematics. Nevertheless, this work of Fowler does not diminish the value of\nCataldi\n's contibutions.\nBortolotti also studied\nFibonacci\n,\ndel Ferro\n,\nTartaglia\n,\nCardan\n,\nFerrari\n. In\n1915\nBortolotti wrote a paper on the National Italian Institute in the Napoleonic period while in\n1929\nhe published the previously lost work of Books\n4\nand\n5\nof\nBombelli\n's\nAlgebra\n(\nBortolotti's text was republished in\n1966)\n.\nIn\n1924\nBortolotti made an important discovery. Paolo Bonasoni was a professor at the University of Bologna during the late sixteenth century. His book\nAlgebra geometrica\nâ\n(\nGeometric algebra\n)\n, written around\n1575\n, was unpublished and unknown until\n1924\nwhen it was discovered in the University of Bologna archives by Bortolotti. This book was remarkable in containing a far more geometric approach to algebra than others from the same period. There is certainly a strong argument supporting the view that if the work had been widely known at the time it was written, the fusion of algebra and geometry which was achieved by\nDescartes\nmight have occurred much earlier. Bortolotti's discovery was certainly an important event in the history of mathematics.\nIn\n1937\nBortolotti attended the fourth International Congress of the History of Sciences held in Prague. He contributed three papers to the conference:\nMathematica babilonese; L'Histoire des sciences dans l'enseignement et l'enseignement de l'histoire des sciences\nâ\n(\nMathematics of Babylon; History of science in education and teaching of the history of science\n)\n; and\nInterpretazione storica di testi matematici babilonesi\nâ\n(\nHistorical interpretation of Babylonian mathematical texts\n)\n. The papers are given in\n[\n6\n]\n.\nOther papers by Bortolotti on the history of mathematics written during the final ten years of his life include:\nI primi algoritmi infiniti nelle opere dei matematici italiani del secolo XVII\nâ\n(\nThe first infinite algorithms  in the works of the Italian mathematicians of the seventeenth century\n)\n(1939)\n;\nL'Opera geometrica di Evangelista Torricelli\nâ\n(\nThe geometric work of Evangelista Torricelli\n)\n(1939)\n;\nLe fonti della matematica moderna. Matematica sumerica e matematica babilonese\nâ\n(\nThe sources of modern mathematics. Mathematics of Sumeria and Babylon\n)\n(1940)\n;\nInfluenza del campo numerico sullo sviluppo delle teorie algebriche\nâ\n(\nThe numeric field influence on the development of algebraic theories\n)\n(1941)\n;\nIl carteggio matematico di Giovanni Regiomontano con Giovanni Bianchini, Giacomo Speier e Cristiano Roder\nâ\n(\nThe mathematical correspondence of John Regiomontano with Giovanni Bianchini, James Speier and Christian Roder\n)\n(1942)\n;\nLa pubblicazione delle opere e del carteggio matematico di Paolo Ruffini\nâ\n(\nThe publication of the works and the mathematical correspondence of Paolo Ruffini\n)\n(1943)\n;\nIl problema della tangente nell'opera geometrica di Evangelista Torricelli\nâ\n(\nThe problem of the tangent geometric work of Evangelista Torricelli\n)\n(1943)\n;\nLe serie divergenti nel carteggio matematico di Paolo Ruffini\nâ\n(\nDivergent series in mathematical correspondence of Paolo Ruffini\n)\n(1944)\n;\nIl carteggio matematico di Paolo Ruffini\nâ\n(\nThe mathematical correspondence of Paolo Ruffini\n)\n(1947)\n.\nWe will say just a few words about some of these papers. In the\n1939\npaper on\nTorricelli\n, Bortolotti gives a concise survey of\nTorricelli\n's geometrical investigations, giving his theorems and proofs in modern symbols as well as in the original form. In the\n1940\npaper on Babylonian mathematics, Bortolotti gives a summary of problems published by\nNeugebauer\nbut argues that the fact that large series of examples for quadratic equations are made up from the same roots demonstrates that this pair of roots has an 'arcane mystic property'. Finally let us note that\nNeugebauer\nwas unhappy with many aspects of the\n1941\npaper of Bortolotti whose title we quoted above:-\nMany corrections to the first part could be made, e.g. fourth millennium should be replaced by second millennium. It is also wrong to deny the existence of approximations to irrational square roots, to assume a geometrical basis of the quadratic equations or to deny the existence of texts of this type in the Hellenistic period.",
