  "biografia": "Calixto CalderÃ³n\nis the son of Pedro Juan CalderÃ³n and Matilde Angela Garcia. Pedro CalderÃ³n, from an old colonial family, was a surgeon who had trained in Buenos Aires and later in Paris under Georges Marion, the famous French surgeon and urologist. Pedro, who of course was Spanish speaking, was also fluent in French and Italian. He practiced as a surgeon in Mendoza. He married HaydÃ©e Cores and they had a son,\nAlberto Pedro CalderÃ³n\nborn\n1920\n, who became a well known mathematician\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nDr Pedro CalderÃ³n had a natural affinity for mathematics and music. He would have undoubtedly subscribed to\nLeibniz\n's famous saying that: \"Music is the secret arithmetic of the soul, unaware of its act of counting.\" The fact is that he tried to instil in his sons, at an early age, a keen interest in mathematics and music. \"At the dinner table he would challenge\nAlberto\n, a boy of six or seven, to make rapid mental calculations; or he would play classical music for\nAlberto\nan his older sister Nenacha.\"\nHaydÃ©e CalderÃ³n died at a young age in\n1932\nand Pedro CalderÃ³n later married Matilde GarcÃ­a Gallo who was much younger. Matilde was the daughter of Edibert Garcia Gallo who had been born in the Basque region of France in\n1881\n. She was Spanish speaking but also fluent in French and knew basic German. Pedro and Matilde had three children, a daughter Matilde Jr, a son Calixto, the subject of this biography, and a younger daughter MarÃ­a Teresa. Pedro treated Matilde Jr and Calixto in the same way at the dinner table as he had Alberto and Margarita\n(\nknown as Nenacha\n)\n. As well as mathematics and music, Calixto's parents gave him a love of modern languages.\nCalixto was educated at the Colegio Marista San Josee de Mendoza. This religious school was founded in\n1917\nand by\n1947\n, when Calixto was a primary pupil, there were\n405\nprimary pupils and\n204\nsecondary pupils. His favourite subject at school was physics but his father believed that to have a good career one needed to study practical subjects so, after graduating from the school, Calixto entered the University of Cuyo to study engineering. The University of Cuyo was Calixto's local university, situated in Mendoza. CalderÃ³n entered the School of Engineering and there he studied mathematics, physics, technical drawing and chemistry. Calixto's real love, however, was for mathematics and his brother\nAlberto CalderÃ³n\n, by this time Professor of Mathematics at the University of Chicago, encouraged him to switch to mathematics.\nAlberto CalderÃ³n\nadvised his brother to study at the University of Buenos Aires where, he said,\nAlberto GonzÃ¡lez DomÃ­nguez\nwas both an outstanding teacher and very supportive of his students. Not only did\nAlberto CalderÃ³n\ngive his brother strong moral support for the move but he also offered financial support. In\n1961\nCalixto left the University of Cuyo and began to study mathematics at the University of Buenos Aires.\nThe first course Calixto CalderÃ³n studied in the Faculty of Exact and Natural Sciences was Funciones Reales I, a course on Lebesgue integration given by Evelio Oklander. At this stage in his career, Oklander was an instructor and soon after delivering this course he went to the University of Chicago where he studied for a Ph.D. advised by\nAlberto CalderÃ³n\n. Calixto CalderÃ³n recorded in\n[\n4\n]\nsome more of his undergraduate experiences:-\nWith the years, I would take Complex Analysis, Ordinary Differential Equations, Funciones Reales II, Partial Differential Equations, Topology, Functional Analysis, Projective Geometry, Differential Geometry, and other important subjects. We had a first rate faculty teaching these fundamental courses. Among them I remember:\nAlberto GonzÃ¡lez DomÃ­nguez\n,\nMischa Cotlar\n,\nLuis SantalÃ³\n, Mario GutiÃ©rrez Burzaco, Rafael Panzone, Agnes Benedek, Miguel Herrera, and Prof Roque Carranza\n(\nstatistician\n)\n. This period was replete of personal experiences. I met mathematicians like Dr\nJulio Rey Pastor\nand\nBeppo Levi\nduring the mathematical teas that were held in the OEA building of Avenida de Mayo. A full floor had been loaned to the School of Exact Sciences of the University of Buenos Aires.\nCalixto CalderÃ³n was awarded his Licenciado en Ciencias MatemÃ¡ticas in\n1965\n. It was his one of the last courses he took before graduating which particularly influenced the direction of his future studies\n[\n4\n]\n:-\nShortly before my graduation as \"Licenciado en Ciencias MatemÃ¡ticas,\" I took a course on \"Boundary Values of Analytic Functions\" that was taught by Dr\nGonzÃ¡lez DomÃ­nguez\n. That course was an introduction to \"mes premiÃ©res armes\" in mathematics. Dr\nGonzÃ¡lez DomÃ­nguez\nwould become my thesis adviser later. I learned from him topics such as the Central Limit Theorem in Probability Theory, Introduction to Functions of\nHille\n(\nHermite\nExpansions\n)\n,\nLaguerre\nExpansions, Theory of Approximation and Theory of Distributions. ... the most discernible influence on\nGonzÃ¡lez DomÃ­nguez\nwas\nEiner Hille\n's work \"A Class of Reciprocal Functions.\" That influence was passed on to me and from me on to some of my own students. During my formative years, Dr Rafael Panzone and his wife Dr Agnes Benedek had a tremendous influence in developing my mathematical taste and knowledge.\nAfter graduating from the University of Buenos Aires in\n1965\n, Calixto CalderÃ³n spent a year as a specialist in the Department of Science Affairs at the Pan American Union in Washington, D.C. After this, he was appointed as an assistant professor at the University of Cuyo at Mendoza, then at the University of San Juan in San Juan followed by the University of San Luis in San Luis. While at San Luis he taught a course on Distribution Theory and Linear Partial Differential Equations. In\n1967\n, while teaching at the University of Cuyo, he had begun to undertake research at the University of Buenos Aires for his doctorate advised by\nGonzÃ¡lez DomÃ­nguez\n. This was a little more complicated than it might have been since\nGonzÃ¡lez DomÃ­nguez\nspent a year as a visiting professor at the University of Hawaii. Despite this, in only two years he had completed his thesis\nTransformaciÃ³n mÃºltiple de Weierstrass y sumabilidad de las series mÃºltiples de Hermite y de Laguerre\nâ\n(\nMultiple Weierstrass transformation and summability of multiple Hermite and Laguerre series\n)\nwhich he submitted in April\n1969\n. In the thesis he wrote:-\nOn this occasion, I want to thank Dr\nAlberto GonzÃ¡lez DomÃ­nguez\n, who proposed the problem to me, for his assistance during the preparation of the work and for his opportune suggestions to improve some proofs.\nAfter the award of the degree of Ph.D., in August\n1969\nhe went to the University of Minnesota where he had a one-year visiting appointment. He wrote\n[\n4\n]\n:-\nAt that time I met Eugene Fabes, who would have a great influence on my career. I expanded my professional interests as to include Singular Integrals, Differentiation Theory and, much later in time, Differential Equations. This was the time when I became acquainted with the\nNavier\nStokes\nEquations.\nReturning to Argentina, he was appointed as an Assistant Professor of Mathematics at the University of Buenos Aires in\n1970\n. He became the thesis advisor of\nLuis Caffarelli\nwho writes\n[\n3\n]\n:-\n... Calixto became my mentor. Beyond mathematics, Calixto taught us how to be an analyst, to seek the heart of an issue, to understand a problem. In fact, Calixto is a non-conventional mathematician and his work has expended in diverse areas, and presented new insights. By that time Calixto had already started to think on new issues concerning harmonic analysis and partial differential equations.\nIn\n1972\nCalixto CalderÃ³n left Buenos Aires and returned to the University of Minnesota where he had been offered a permanent appointment.\nCaffarelli\nsubmitted his thesis\nSobre conjugaciÃ³n y sumabilidad de series de Jacobi\nâ\n(\nOn conjugation and summability of Jacobi series\n)\nto the University of Buenos Aires and he was awarded a Ph.D. in\n1972\n. He followed CalderÃ³n to the University of Minnesota in January\n1973\nand they wrote two joint papers:\nWeak type estimates for the Hardy-Littlewood maximal functions\n(1974)\n; and\nOn Abel summability of multiple Jacobi series\n(1974)\n.\nCaffarelli\ntells us what the University of Minnesota was like at that time in\n[\n10\n]\n:-\nI came to the United States to the University of Minnesota in January ofÂ\n1973\n. There was no email, no fax, and even the telephone was very expensive. But I found at Minnesota and in the mid-west an extraordinary group of people. My colleagues were extremely generous, dedicated, and friendly, and they taught me much of what I know. They shared their ideas and gave me guidance as I began my research programme.\nCalixto CalderÃ³n found his time at the University of Minnesota very positive in developing his career, particularly the collaboration he began with his two colleagues NÃ©stor Marcelo RiviÃ¨re\n(1940\n-\n1978)\nand Eugene Barry Fabes\n(1937\n-\n1997)\n. They published the joint paper\nMaximal smoothing operators\nin\n1974\n. CalderÃ³n left the University of Minnesota in the autumn of\n1974\nto take up a tenured position at the University of Illinois Chicago Circle. Caffarelli writes\n[\n3\n]\n:-\nOnce more, he embedded himself in new problems and ideas, some connected to his past research, others bold and new. From these times are his articles on existence of solutions to\nNavier\nStokes\nEquations in a very particular norm and through the years Calixto published articles in diverse areas such as tumour growth, multiscale species competition, probability. For Calixto, doing mathematics never felt like an obligation but always an enjoyment. He also took a strong interest at this time in the history of science and, in particular, the early contributions to science of the Hispanic culture.\nThe historical papers are\nThe sixteenth century Iberian calculatores\n(1990)\n,\nAlvaro Thomas and the Iberian calculatores\n(1991)\n, and\nCopernico el Mito y la Controversia\nâ\n(\nCopernicus: the myth and the controversy\n)\n(2006)\n. His work on mathematical biology has been much more extensive and is reviewed in detail in\n[\n1\n]\n. Evans Afenya, who was a Ph.D. student of CalderÃ³n's at the University of Illinois Chicago and is now an internationally leading professor researching mathematical modelling of cancer and cancer treatments, begins the introduction as follows:-\nAside from his primary areas of interest in harmonic analysis, it is important to mention that at some point in the career of Prof CalderÃ³n, he started getting interested in the applications of mathematical ideas and techniques to problems of biology and medicine. It had always been the view of Prof CalderÃ³n that biology and medicine could benefit from systematised mathematical support just as how the disciplines of physics and engineering benefitted immensely from such support many years ago. It is, therefore, not surprising that a number of doctoral candidates produced by Prof CalderÃ³n completed their dissertations on topics related to mathematical biology.\nThe article\n[\n1\n]\ngives details of Calixto CalderÃ³n work in three sections: Solid Tumour Modelling; Disseminated Cancer Modelling; and Other Biomathematical Works of Prof CalderÃ³n. Among his Ph.D. students in this area are: Tor Anthony Kwembe,\nNonlinear Diffusion and its Application to Biomathematics\n(1989)\n, Marwan Saeed Abual-rub Abualrub,\nNonlinear Partial Differential Equations Applied to Diffusion Problems arising in Mathematical Biology\n(1992)\n, and Evans Afenya,\nModelling Granulocytopoiesis, Normal and Leukemic States\n(1992)\n.\nCalixto CalderÃ³n continued to hold the professorship at the University of Illinois Chicago until he retired in\n2003\n. He did, however, hold several other positions during these years. He was a visiting professor at Rice University in Houston, Texas in\n1979\n, a visiting professor at the Institute of Science in Santa Fe, Argentina in\n1983\nand was on the faculty at Oakton College in Des Plaines, Illinois from\n1988\nonwards.\nIn\n[\n8\n]\nCalixto CalderÃ³n's first wife is given as Graciela Gnavi and it states that they had three children: Graciela, Sara, and Rodrigo. This must refer to Graciela Delia Gnavi who was a Ph.D. student at the University of Buenos Aires when Calixto worked there in\n1970\n-\n72\n. Her thesis advisor was\nAlberto GonzÃ¡lez DomÃ­nguez\nand her thesis was\nFactorizaciÃ³n de operadores caracterÃ­sticos de puertos de Hilbert y sÃ­ntesis de\n2\nN-puertos reactivos de matriz de transferencia prefijada\nâ\n(\nFactorisation of characteristic Hilbert port operators and synthesis of\n2\nN-reactive prefixed-transfer matrix ports\n)\n(1974)\n. The reference\n[\n8\n]\nstates that Calixto and Graciela were divorced. We have not found any collaborative evidence for Calixto CalderÃ³n's first marriage and we note that Graciela Gnavi continues to write papers until\n1988\ngiving her address as the University of Buenos Aires. Calixto CalderÃ³n then married the medical practitioner Cathie E Dunal\n(\nborn September\n1952)\nwith whom he had three children: Cayetana\n(\nborn about\n1986)\n, Ruy Gaspar\n(\nborn about\n1989)\n, and Alvar\n(\nborn about\n1991)\n.\nCalixto CalderÃ³n retired from the University of Illinois Chicago in\n2003\nbut continued to teach at Oakton College in Des Plaines. He writes in\n[\n4\n]\n:-\nAfter my retirement. I remained in Chicago. I contacted the analysts at De Paul University ... I had the chance to participate actively in their Analysis Seminar.\nIn\n2012\na conference in honour of Calixto CalderÃ³n was organised at the Department of Mathematics and Actuarial Sciences of Roosevelt University,\n16\n-\n18\nNovember. The references\n[\n1\n]\n,\n[\n2\n]\n,\n[\n3\n]\n,\n[\n4\n]\nare articles arising from talks given at that conference published in the book\nSpecial Functions, Partial Differential Equations, and Harmonic Analysis. In Honor of Calixto P CalderÃ³n\n(\nSpringer International Publishing,\n2014)\nedited by A M Stokolos, C Georgakis and W Urbina. We end this biography by quoting from the Preface to that book\n[\n11\n]\n:-\nCalixto P CalderÃ³n, like many Argentine mathematicians of his generation, was introduced and mentored into Harmonic Analysis and Partial Differential Equations at the University of Buenos Aires by\nAlberto GonzÃ¡lez DomÃ­nguez\n, his teacher and Ph.D. advisor, whose mentor was\nDavid Tamarkin\nof Brown University. Moreover, Calixto P CalderÃ³n proved very early in his career to be an influential teacher and mentor for\nLuis A Caffarelli\n, a world authority on Free Boundary Value Problems in Partial Differential Equations and recent recipient of the prestigious Israel's Wolf Prize.\nThe papers presented by his friends or colleagues and some of his former doctoral students at the conference in honour of Calixto P CalderÃ³n at Roosevelt University were indicative to a large extent of the wide scope and depth of his research work and scholarship in pure and applied mathematics. Furthermore, the friendly and festive atmosphere among the participants at the conference from the USA and Latin America reflected very much his wonderful charismatic personality and humility. A memorable moment was the scene where the president of Roosevelt University, while addressing the participants briefly, asked those in the audience who were Calixto P CalderÃ³n's students to raise their hands, and\nLuis A Caffarelli\n's hand went up!\nCalixto P CalderÃ³n's numerous research publications include: Classical Fourier series and Orthogonal Expansions, CalderÃ³n-Zygmund Theory of Singular Integrals, Ordinary and Partial Differential Equations especially the\nNavier\n-\nStokes\np.d.e, Probability Theory, Mathematical Models Applied to Biology and Medicine, and History of Mathematics and Science. Clearly, his work in pure mathematics was influenced by\nAlberto GonzÃ¡lez DomÃ­nguez\n,\nAlberto P CalderÃ³n\n- his brother,\nAntoni Zygmund\n, and several other collaborators and colleagues. Whereas his considerable research work in Mathematical Biology and Medicine might have been the result of the influence he received while growing up from his father, Dr Pedro J CalderÃ³n, an accomplished physician trained in Medicine in Buenos Aires and Paris. One can't help but note that, likewise, the father of\nAristotle\n, Nicomachus, who did experimental research in Biology and Botany, although he was\nPlato\n's greatest student of pure philosophy, was also a medical physician and, in fact, the personal physician of King Philip of Macedon.\nExcept for the appointments at the University of Cuyo, the University of Buenos Aires, and the University of Minnesota, Calixto P CalderÃ³n spent most of his distinguished academic career at the University of Illinois at Chicago\n(\nU.I.C.\n)\n. He taught a variety of courses ranging from Harmonic Analysis and Partial Differential Equations to Probability Theory and Statistics, and had several Ph.D. students. His strong interest in probability and statistics may be attributed in part to his Statistics teacher - Roque Carranza at the University of Buenos Aires. He wrote two papers on the subject including a paper on\nKolmogorov\n's strong law of large numbers for pair-wise independent random variables. The themes of the thesis of his Ph.D. students, like his research, ranged from Harmonic Analysis to the history of Spanish mathematics and related science. During his tenure at U.I.C., Calixto P CalderÃ³n was an active participant and invited speaker at seminars in the Chicago area, including the CalderÃ³n-\nZygmund\nSeminar at the University of Chicago, and the analysis seminars at U.I.C., and at DePaul University. Furthermore, Calixto P CalderÃ³n was an excellent and eloquent lecturer, and remained actively engaged in issues related to mathematics education at U.I.C.\nCalixto CalderÃ³n continues to undertake research and publish papers. Four joint papers appearing after\n2014\nare:\nSome non standard applications of the Laplace method\n(2014)\n;\nPotential operators with mixed homogeneity\n(2017)\n;\nSome new results onÂ H summability of Fourier series\n(2019)\n; and\nA characterization of the Lorentz spaceÂ\nL\n(\np\n,\nr\n)\nL(p, r)\nL\n(\np\n,\nr\n)\nÂ in terms of Orlicz type classes\n(2021)\n.",
