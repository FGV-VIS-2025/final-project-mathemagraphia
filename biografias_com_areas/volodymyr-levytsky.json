  "biografia": "Volodymyr Levytsky\nattended the University of Lemberg in what is now called Lviv, receiving his doctorate in\n1901\n. After this he taught both mathematics and physics at high schools. At that time Lviv was part of the Austrian Empire and was known as Lemberg.\nThe University of Lemberg, which Levytsky studied at, was an ancient educational establishment which was founded in\n1784\n. However problems arose between the Polish and Ukrainian populations after World War I. Ukrainian students were not permitted to enrol at the University in\n1919\nand the following year Ukrainian lecturers were banned from the University, only Polish citizens being allowed as lecturers.\nThe Ukrainian students who could no longer enrol at Lemberg University set up their own University, the Lviv\n(\nUnderground\n)\nUkrainian University, in July\n1921\n. Levytsky taught mathematics at this new university from its foundation. The Underground Ukrainian University was financed by private donations and was able to survive for a few years but, when it was denied official recognition, it was forced to close in\n1925\n.\nLevytsky headed the mathematics-physics section of the Shevchenko Scientific Society in Lviv. He served for two terms as the President of the Society from\n1931\nto\n1935\nand also was editor of the Journal of the Society. From\n1940\n, until his death in\n1956\n, Levytsky taught at the Lviv Pedagogical Institute.\nLevytsky wrote the first mathematical paper in Ukrainian and was the editor of the first Ukrainian mathematical journal. Most of his publications were in the area of functions of a complex variable. However he was also very active in applications of mathematics to theoretical physics.\nHe is known for his work on Ukrainian mathematical, physical and chemical terminology, which was one of the main areas of study of the Shevchenko Scientific Society in Lviv. Levytsky also wrote important historical works on mathematics at the Lviv\n(\nUnderground\n)\nUkrainian University and mathematics at the Shevchenko Scientific Society.",
