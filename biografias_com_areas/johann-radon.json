  "biografia": "Johann Radon\n's parents were Anton Radon and Anna Schmiedeknecht. Anton, who worked at a local bank as the head bookkeeper, had been married before and had daughters with his first wife. Johann, who was Anna and Anton's only child, was brought up in with his half sisters in Tetschen for the first ten years of his life. There he attended the elementary school where he completed the five year course in four years.\nJohann then attended secondary school in Leitmeritz\n(\nnow Litomerice\n)\nin Bohemia between\n1897\nand\n1905\n. Around half way through his schooling his father retired from the bank in Tetschen and the whole family moved to Leitmeritz. His favourite subjects at this school were mathematics and classical languages. His performance in all subjects was outstanding and for a while he thought that classical languages might he the topic for him to study at university, but later his love of mathematics led him to chose that topic. He did miss the seventh grade at school due to bad health and, in addition to asthma beginning to trouble him at that time, he also had to undergo surgery. His father employed a private tutor to make sure that Johann would be able to enter the eight grade when he had recovered. We have explained how he was attracted by classical languages but he did also consider other directions such as philosophy. He was a talented singer with a beautiful baritone voice and at one stage he also considered training to become an opera singer.\nHe entered the University of Vienna in\n1905\nhaving moved to that city with his parents. The course he studied was a broad one including mathematics, physics, chemistry, logic, philosophy, and he also included some lecture courses on music. In mathematics he took lecture courses by\nHans Hahn\n(\none on Theoretical arithmetic and one on the Foundations of geometry\n)\n,\nWilhelm Wirtinger\n(\nOrdinary differential equations\n)\nand\nFranz Mertens\n(\none on Algebra and one on\nNumber theory\n)\namong others. He was awarded a doctorate in\n1910\nfor a dissertation on the\ncalculus of variations\ncarried out under Gustav von Escherich's supervision. His thesis was examined by\nWirtinger\nand von Escherich.\nThe winter semester of\n1911\n-\n12\nwas spent in GÃ¶ttingen where he attended lectures by\nHilbert\n, became an assistant at the University of BrÃ¼nn\n(\nnow Brno\n)\nfor a year and then moved to the Technische Hochschule in Vienna to become an assistant to the actuarial mathematician\nEmanuel Czuber\n. In\n1913\nhe submitted his dissertation\nTheory and applications of absolutely additive set functions\nto the University of Vienna to satisfy the requirements of his\nhabilitation\nthere, and became a\nprivatdozent\n. Von Escherich examined this habilitation dissertation and wrote:-\nWhile creating a theory of absolutely additive set functions which, heretofore, has barely been investigated, the author succeeds with the development of a theory that contains the theory of integral equations, linear and bilinear forms in infinitely many variables, as a special case. He did this, overcoming considerable obstacles, through a combination of\nStieltjes\n',\nLebesgue\n's and\nHellinger\n's concepts of an integral. The paper is full of original and significant ideas.\nRadon married Maria Rigele, who was a secondary school teacher of science, in\n1916\n; they had four children the first of which was born in\n1917\nbut only lived\n18\ndays. They then had a son Hermann who was born in\n1918\n, a son Ludwig born in\n1919\n, and a daughter Brigitte born in\n1924\n. Hermann died from an illness in\n1939\nand Ludwig was killed on the Russian front in\n1943\n. Brigitte went on to obtain a Ph.D. in mathematics and marry the mathematician Erich Bukovics in\n1950\n.\nIn\n1919\nRadon became an extraordinary professor at Hamburg shortly after being promoted to an extraordinary professorship in Vienna in an attempt to keep him there. The University of Hamburg was a new university, opening in May\n1919\nshortly before Radon was appointed on the recommendation of\nBlaschke\n. Although happy in Hamburg, he left to become a full professor in Greifswald in\n1922\nwhere he succeeded\nHausdorff\n. Radon had an enjoyable social life in Greifswald; he enjoyed sailing and playing the lute.\nHe moved to Erlangen in\n1925\nwhere he filled the chair which had been left vacant when\nTietze\nleft to accept the chair in Munich. As in Greifswald, Radon and his wife had an enjoyable social life in Erlangen; they organised fancy dress parties and Radon enjoyed playing the violin in a trio.\nIn\n1928\nRadon moved again, this time to the University of Breslau where he succeeded\nAdolf Kneser\non his retirement. After happy times in Greifswald and Erlangen, fate was cruel to Radon in Breslau. His son Hermann was diagnosed as having an incurable disease and, despite strenuous attempts to have him regain his health in Switzerland, he slowly deteriorated. Because of worries with his family, Radon declined the offer of the chair in Vienna in\n1938\nleft vacant when\nWirtinger\nretired. Radon himself became ill and underwent surgery in\n1939\n; he was recovering in hospital when informed of Hermann's death. Of course\n1939\nmarked the beginning of World War II and Radon's son Ludwig served in the German army, dying in\n1943\nafter being fatally wounded on the Russian front. The Germans fortified Breslau but it came under increasing Russian pressure from August\n1944\nas the Russian offensive swept rapidly west. The centre of Breslau was bombed on\n7\nOctober\n1944\nbut the Mathematical Institute was essentially undamaged\n(\nonly\n4\npanes of glass were broken\n)\n. By January\n1945\nthe Russian army was advancing towards Breslau and a decision was taken to move the mathematicians from the city. In February\nFeigl\nand his colleagues moved the Mathematical Institute from Breslau to SchÃ¶nburg Castle at Wechselburg, not far from Leipzig. Radon joined them at Wechselburg where there were no books, lecture notes, or resources of any kind. Radon gave a course on complex analysis completely from memory having no materials available to help him.\nRadon's sister-in-law lived in Innsbruck so he made a bold bid to move to that city. He contacted\nLeopold Vietoris\n, the only mathematician left there since all the others had been drafted into the military. Receiving an invitation from\nVietoris\n, Radon and his family made the tortuous journey through war-torn Europe and arrived in Innsbruck after many hardships. He started teaching there immediately and remained there until the summer of\n1946\n. After an initial misunderstanding when colleagues in Vienna thought that he was not interested in either of two vacant professorships there, he was appointed to Vienna taking up his appointment on\n1\nOctober\n1946\n. He remained there for the rest of his life, serving as dean during\n1951\n-\n52\n, and rector in\n1954\n.\nRadon applied the calculus of variations to\ndifferential geometry\nwhich led to applications in number theory. It was while he was studying applications of the calculus of variations to differential geometry that he discovered curves which are now named Radon curves. His best known results involve combining the integration theories of\nLebesgue\nand\nStieltjes\nwhich first appeared in his habilitation dissertation\n(\nwhich we mentioned above\n)\nand then in a second important work\nÃber lineare Funktionaltransformationen und Funktionalgleichungen\nâ\n(\nOn linear functional transformations and functional equations\n)\n(1919)\n[\n5\n]\n:-\nIt assumed a fundamental importance for functional analysis and has become of equal importance for the application to the logarithmic potential. Next came papers on convex functions and sets and on the determination of functions from the values of their integrals on certain manifolds\n[\nÃber die Bestimmung von Funktionen durch ihre Integralwerte lÃ¤ngs gewisser Mannigfaltigkeiten\nâ\n(\nOn the definition of functions by their integral values along certain manifolds\n)\n(1917)]\nwhich contains the Radon transform that plays an important role today, especially in medicine and geophysics.\nDuring\n1918\n-\n19\nhe worked on affine differential geometry, then in\n1926\nhe considered conformal differential geometry. His wide interests led him to study Riemannian geometry and geometrical problems which arose in the study of relativity.\nRadon had a long association with the\nAustrian Academy of Sciences\n. His doctoral thesis and his habilitation dissertation were both published by the Academy. He was elected a corresponding member of the Academy in\n1939\nand a full member in\n1947\n. He was chairman of the Mathematical and Physical Section of the Academy from\n1952\nto\n1956\n. He also served the\nAustrian Mathematical Society\nbeing president in\n1948\n-\n50\n.",
