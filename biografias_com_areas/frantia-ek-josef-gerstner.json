  "biografia": "Let us note first that\nFrantiÅ¡ek Josef Gerstner\nis also known as\nFranz Josef Ritter von Gerstner\n. FrantiÅ¡ek is the Czech version of his forename while Franz is the German version. He became Ritter von Gerstner when he was elevated to the nobility in\n1810\n. The town of his birth is known in Czech as Chomutov but it was also known by the German name of Komotau; it is roughly equidistant between Leipzig and Prague. He was the son of Florian Gerstner\n(1730\n-\n1783)\n, a leather worker, and Maria Elisabeth Englert, the daughter of a butcher. Frantisek was educated in his home town of Chomutov, attending the Jesuit Gymnasium from\n1765\n. During\n1771\n-\n72\n, he was taught by Ignaz Cornova\n(1740\n-\n1822)\n, a Jesuit priest and historian who left Chomutov in\n1773\nto became a professor of Poetry and Classical Greek at the Jesuit college in Klatovy. At the Jesuit Gymnasium, Gerstner's\n[\n2\n]\n:-\n... favourite subjects included mathematics and physics and where he learnt perfect Latin. He was very dexterous, and acquired technical skills in many different crafts\n(\njoinery, carpentry, locksmith work, smithing, bricklaying, dyeing, soap-making, etc.\n)\n. He eventually put these practical skills to a good use during his pedagogical career.\nIn\n1772\nGerstner graduated from the Jesuit Gymnasium in Chomutov and entered the Faculty of Philosophy at the Charles-Ferdinand University in Prague to study mathematics and astronomy. He studied elementary mathematics with Stanislav Vydra\n(1741\n-\n1804)\n, higher mathematics with Jan Tesanek\n(1728\n-\n1788)\nand astronomy with Joseph Stepling\n(1716\n-\n1778)\n. Stepling was a Jesuit priest who was an astronomer, physicist and mathematician. He founded the Clementinum Observatory in Prague in\n1751\nand was appointed to teach mathematics and physics at the University of Prague in\n1753\n. He championed the ideas of\nNewton\nand\nEuler\n. Tesanek, also a Jesuit, was a student of Stepling at the University of Prague. He became an expert in the works of\nNewton\nand was appointed as Professor of Higher Mathematics at the University. Vydra was a student at the University of Prague where he was taught by both Tesanek and Stepling. He served as Professor of Mathematics at the University of Prague from\n1772\n, teaching elementary mathematics. In\n1776\nGerstner passed his astronomy examination and in the following year he was examined in\nNewton\n's\nPhilosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica\nâ\n(\nMathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy\n)\n, again passing the public examination.\nGerstner's family were not well off, and so he had to earn money to support himself during his student years. He did this by earning money by playing the organ in various Prague churches, but he also gave private tutoring in mathematics in order to cover his living expenses. He completed his studies at the University of Prague in\n1777\n, and in\n1779\nhe was employed as an engineer with the Robot Abolition Commission. The Domains and Robot Abolition Commission was responsible for converting church and other land in crown control to peasant ownership. He did not find this occupation very pleasing, so in\n1781\nhe decided to have a complete change of career and went to Vienna to study medicine. He rapidly decided this was not a good move, and returning to mathematics and astronomy, he spent the next three years working as an observer at the University Observatory in Vienna. This observatory was built in\n1743\n-\n54\non the roof of one of the university buildings. Gerstner was an assistant of the director of the University Observatory, Maximilian Hell\n(1720\n-\n1792)\n. Hell had been director of the Observatory since\n1756\n, had published astronomical tables, and had been to Sweden in\n1769\nto observe the transit of Venus on\n3\nJune of that year.\nAntonÃ­n Strnad\n(1746\n-\n1799)\nwas a Jesuit who, after the abolition of the Jesuit Order in\n1773\n, studied mathematics, physics and astronomy under Joseph Stepling at the University of Prague. After the death of Stepling in\n1778\n, Strnad was appointed as an extraordinary professor, and became director of the Clementinum Observatory in\n1781\n. In\n1784\nGerstner was appointed as Strnad's senior assistant. His publications were in German and began in the following year with\nOn the determination of longitudes, correcting the longitudes of Marseille, Padua, KremsmÃ¼nster, Dresden, Berlin and Danzig\n. In\n1786\nhe published\nTransit of Mercury in front of the Sun. Observed\n4\nMay\n1786\n.\nWhen Gerstner's former teacher of higher mathematics, Jan TesÃ¡nek, fell ill in\n1787\n, Gerstner provided him with careful care in his own apartment and at the same time taught TesÃ¡nek's students higher mathematics. Following TesÃ¡nek's death in\n1788\n, Gerstner was employed as an assistant to take over his teaching commitments at the University of Prague. In the following year he become professor of Higher Mathematics, Astronomy, Mechanics and Hydraulics at the University in Prague. Let us record at this point that his most famous student was\nBernard Bolzano\nwho entered the Philosophy Faculty of the Charles University of Prague in\n1796\n, studying philosophy, physics and mathematics. In\n1799\nBolzano\nbegan undertaking research advised by Gerstner and was awarded a doctorate in\n1804\n.\nIn\n1792\nGerstner married Gabriele von Mayersbach, the daughter of the medical doctor Moritz Adolph Mayer von Mayersbach and his wife Maria Greger von Ehrenberg, in Prague. They had five sons and four daughters. One of their sons was Franz Anton Gerstner\n(11\nMay\n1796\n-\n12\nApril\n1840)\nwho achieved fame as a civil engineer and railway pioneer. We will say a little about his career at the end of this article.\nA commission was set up in\n1795\nwith the aim of improving higher technical education in the Austrian empire. As a member of this commission, in\n1798\nGerstner drafted a memorandum. He began by stressing the importance of mathematics and physics in technical advances\n(\nsee\n[\n3\n]\nand\n[\n13\n]\n)\n:-\nWherever natural sciences, physics and mathematics are not successfully practised, industry cannot be elevated from its backwardness. New forces and new laws of nature have been discovered, giving rise to new production ... However, even momentous discoveries of science and technology have never been made by a few isolated ingenious minds. First of all, the overall level of general education has to be raised to a high degree of technical knowledge, and a passionate desire has to be aroused for education ... The emerging polytechnic should be designed for the nascent higher technical intelligentsia. Specialised training will be given to owners of iron works, glass works, dye works, to watchmakers, mechanics and builders. It will educate chief officers and foremen at private plants, manufactories and workshops.\nHe argued that a polytechnic should be established\n(\nsee\n[\n3\n]\nand\n[\n13\n]\n)\n:-\nThe first draft for the foundation of a polytechnic for the entire Habsburg monarchy, submitted in\n1798\n, displayed more or less the following structure. Gerstner intended to set up a school providing two different types of courses, elementary and higher. The elementary course was designed to match subjects taught at Prague University's Faculty of Philosophy, while the higher course offered solely technical subjects. The higher course was expected eventually to form the basis for an independent school - a polytechnic. The elementary course was based on mathematics and natural science subjects\n(\nthe project reckoned on the establishment of collections including exhibits on natural sciences, physics and machinery, and a botanical garden\n)\n. Gerstner's higher course also covered the so-called professional sciences, based on industrial and generally technical studies.\nHaving set out the details of what should be taught and how professors should be appointed, Gerstner gave a list of the advantages:-\n... in addition to teaching students, the school could also train teachers of technical subjects, take over supervision of the emerging secondary technical and industrial schools, devote itself consistently to practical work, prepare expert opinions on technical projects, and, last but not least, train graduates for the civil service\n(\nincluding military careers\n)\n.\nGerstner's proposals, which were made at the time of the Napoleonic wars,  did not find favour, so, in\n1803\n, he made a second proposal involving converting the Prague School of Engineers, which had been founded in\n1707\n, into a polytechnic school. Emperor Franz Joseph I issued a decree confirming this on\n14\nMarch\n1803\n, naming the new polytechnic the Gerstner Polytechnic. Gerstner, however, did not give up on his original proposal and, with a change of emphasise to the more practical sides of the subjects, this was approved by decree on\n22\nAugust\n1805\n. The Polytechnic Institute in Prague was officially opened on\n10\nNovember\n1806\nwith Gerstner as its first director. The Polytechnic was highly successful with\n106\nstudents in\n1806\nraising to over\n400\nby\n1825\n. It had exceedingly high standards with only around a quarter of the students who entered successfully graduating. We can also judge the success of Gerstner's concept of a polytechnic by the fact that over the following years many similar polytechnics were founded in cities across central Europe.\nIn\n1804\nGerstner published the book\nTheorie der Wellen: samt einer daraus abgeleiteten theorie der deichprofile\nâ\n(\nTheory of waves: together with a theory of dyke profiles derived from it\n)\n. This contained a description of what today are known as Gerstner waves or trochoidal waves. He had first described these in a work of\n1802\n, and his brilliant work was well ahead of its time. Only in\n1863\ndid\nRankine\nindependently discover these waves. The basic idea is as follows. When a wave moves across water, the water itself is not moving along with the wave. But the water cannot remain only moving up and down, for there must be more water under the crest of a wave and less under at a trough. In the Gerstner model, a water particle basically moves in a circle about a fixed point. David Henry writes\n[\n7\n]\n:-\n... Gerstner's flow is dynamically possible: each particle moves on a circle, but the particles never collide and fill out the entire region below the surface wave.\nAnother important work by Gerstner is\nHandbuch der Mechanik\nâ\n(\nManual of MechanicsÂ\n)\nin three volumes:\n1\n.\nMechanik fester KÃ¶rper\nâ\n(\nMechanics of solid bodies\n)\n(1831)\n;\n2\n.\nMechanik flÃ¼ssiger KÃ¶rper\nâ\n(\nMechanics of fluid bodies\n)\n(1831)\n; and\n3\n.\nBeschreibung und Berechnung grÃ¶sserer Maschinenanlagen\nâ\n(\nDescription and calculation of larger mechanical systems\n)\n(1834)\n. Gerstner's son Franz Anton Gerstner wrote a Preface to the work which begins as follows:-\nThe great advances which the mechanics of the heavens made in the last century with the help of higher analysis, already in my father's student years, aroused a keen desire that the same enlightenment would also like to be given to the mechanical trades, to guide them with equal certainty in the progress of industry, and keep them from those cliffs where so many promising enterprises have found their downfall.\nWhen visiting several mechanical workshops, larger state factories and completed buildings, he found the opportunity to draft several essays on such subjects through his own reflection and soon after taking up his post as a teacher of higher mathematics in\n1788\nwith the intention of publishing some smaller writings in the field of architecture and hydrodynamics.\n...\nHe wanted to draw the attention of the heads of agricultural and civil trades to the advantages of mathematical studies and to recommend the study of higher mathematics for their pupils and successors in particular. Precisely his writings were the reason why he was frequently consulted about larger industrial establishments, improvements in the most important Bohemian ironworks and other state factories, and he was thus given the opportunity to become acquainted not only with the advantages and defects of these establishments, but also with the causes of the absorption and decay of other similar factories.\nIn\n1807\n, Gerstner was commissioned by the Bohemian Hydrotechnical Society to calculate possible salt transport routes between Budweis and Linz and to draw up a transport route solution with cost estimates. He investigated a route, partly by water and partly by horse-drawn railway. This would have required making the river Vltava navigable from Budweis to JoachimsmÃ¼hle, and building a railway line from JoachimsmÃ¼hle to Katzbach, near Linz. He found a cheaper solution, however, with a good route for a horse-drawn railway for the whole journey. His plan was accepted in\n1808\nbut the Coalition Wars between the Austrian Empire and the French under Napoleon delayed the start of the project. In fact, only in\n1824\ndid work start with Gerstner's son Franz Anton Gerstner in charge.\nIn\n1808\nGerstner's wife Gabriele died and in\n1809\nhe married Maria Stark. Also in\n1808\n, Franz Joseph Gerstner was awarded the Austrian Order of Leopold and he was elevated to the hereditary nobility in\n1810\n. In\n1811\nthe Emperor appointed him director of hydraulic engineering in Bohemia. His health began to deteriorate and he gave up teaching mathematics in\n1822\nbut continued as director of hydraulic engineering and teaching mechanics. As his health became poorer, he felt forced to resign as director of hydraulic engineering in\n1828\nand gave up teaching mechanics in\n1831\n. At this point he continued as director of the Polytechnic Institute but retired from this position in April\n1832\n. He died in Chateau Mladejov, which he visited frequently after it was acquired by the family Pabstmann in\n1792\n, only three months after he retired and was buried in the cemetery in Mladejov.\nKarl Karmarsch writes in\n[\n9\n]\n:-\nNot only through the educational institution he founded and the other branches of his activity already mentioned did Gerstner render great services to Bohemia; his advice in matters of industrial enterprise was sought after and influential; Indeed, one can rightly say that for almost half a century few such larger undertakings came into being on Bohemian soil without his direct or indirect participation.\nOn\n25\nMay\n1957\nCzechoslovakia issued a series of four stamps to commemorate the\n250\nth anniversary of the creation of the School of Engineering in Prague. The\n30\nhaler stamp had a portrait of Josef Bozek\n(1782\n-\n1835)\n, the\n60\nhaler stamp had a portrait of F J Gerstner, the\n1\nkoruna stamp had a portrait of\nJ Skuhersky\n, and the\n1\n.\n40\nkoruna stamp had a picture of the School of Engineering building. In\n2006\n, the Czech Republic issued an\n11\nkoruna stamp for FrantiÅ¡ek Josef Gerstner. See\nTHIS LINK\n.\nWe promised to give some further details of Gerstner's son, Franz Anton Gerstner\n[\n6\n]\n:-\nFranz Anton grew up in a household of upward mobility, engineering practice, and scholarly research and instruction. He studied at the University of Prague and then at the Standing Technical Institute in Prague, which his father helped to establish. In\n1817\n, he was entrusted with a teaching post in practical, or engineering, geometry at the new Polytechnic Institute at Vienna. Eventually he became professor of mathematics there. Franz Anton's credentials as a professor of engineering knowledge were thus well established. The young nobleman had both the education and the social status to become the leading civil engineer of railroads on the European continent.\nFranz Anton constructed railways in Russia, then went to the United States, arriving in New York on\n5\nNovember\n1838\n. He toured the railroads of America but died of pneumonia a year later in Philadelphia.",
