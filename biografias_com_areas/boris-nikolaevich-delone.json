  "biografia": "Boris Nikolaevich Delone\n's name is sometimes written Delaunay for, although the Russian transliterates into Delone, it is pronounced 'Delaunay'. The name sounds French, and indeed it is for it comes from an ancestor, a French Army officer named 'de Launay' who was a nephew of the Marquis de Launay the governor of the Bastille. The army officer served in Napoleon's army that invaded Russia in\n1812\nand, after being captured, married an aristocratic Russian lady and remained in Russia. Boris Nikolaevich's mother was Nadezhda Alexandrovna and his father was Nikolai Borisovich Delone, a professor of mechanics and physics at St Petersburg University. As one might expect of the son of a university professor, Boris Nikolaevich had an excellent education that developed his many skills and talents. As a child he took music very seriously, playing all the Beethoven sonatas and writing his own compositions that made his talent clear to his teachers. His music teacher insisted that the gifted boy should study music composition at the conservatory after graduating from his high school, while his drawing teacher strongly advised the Delone family that their talented son should continue his education at the Art Academy. Meanwhile, Boris Nikolaevich was also falling in love with science turning the room in his home into a physics laboratory and, at the age of fifteen, building his own telescope with a bronze mirror which he polished himself. Around this time he was also conducting his own mathematical researches and discovered for himself a proof of\nGauss\n's reciprocity law. In addition to this remarkable range of talents, he became an exceptional mountain climber, learning to climb in the Swiss Alps where his family spent most summers when he was a child. He made his first ascent in\n1903\nin the Eastern Dolomites.\nIn the middle of his years at high school the Delone family had moved from St Petersburg to Kiev where Nikolai Borisovich completed his secondary education. He entered Kiev University in\n1908\nbut by this time he had become involved with Russia's first aeronautic circle which he helped organise with his father who had been influenced by\nNikolai Egorovich Zhukovsky\n. They built five gliders, each one an improvement on the one before as they learnt from their experiences. In\n1908\n-\n1909\nthe eighteen-year-old Delone flew the gliders he was constructing, so becoming one of the first Russian glider pilots. In fact his first publication was\nHow to build and fly a cheap and light glider\nin\n1910\n. At Kiev University he studied under Vasilii Petrovich Ermakov and\nDmitrii Aleksandrovich Grave\n. At this stage in his career,\nGrave\nwas undertaking research in algebra and\nnumber theory\n, particularly\nGalois theory\nand the theory of ideals, and it was these topics that formed Delone's areas of research. As an undergraduate he wrote the prize-winning essay\nThe connection between the theory of ideals and Galois theory\nwhich, despite its brilliance, was never published. He graduated from Kiev University in\n1913\nand after the award of his Master's Degree\n(\nequivalent to a doctorate\n)\nin\n1916\n, he began teaching at the University as a\nPrivatdozent\n. He became a member of the Mathematical Society which had among its members Ch T Bialobzeski, P V Voronets, N B Delone\n(\nthe father of the subject of this biography\n)\n,\nD A Grave\n,\nA A Friedmann\n,\nA P Kotelnikov\n, V P Linnik\n(\nI V Linnik\n's father\n)\nand\nO Yu Schmidt\n. We should also mention Delone's influence on\nNikolai Grigorievich Chebotaryov\n, who began studying under\nGrave\nin\n1912\n. The two young men were both very active participants in the algebra and number theory seminar at Kiev. Delone continued his passion for mountaineering and by the time he graduated in\n1913\n, he had become one of the three leading mountaineers in Russia.\nFollowing the Revolution of\n1917\nthere was a change in policy towards education which, certainly in Ukraine, had to become more technology based and more practical. Algebra certainly did not fit into this new educational philosophy and\nGrave\n's algebra seminar was forced to close. Some mathematicians, such as\nGrave\nhimself, changed to study applied mathematical topics. Delone, however, chose to continue to study algebra and so was forced, in the\n1920\ns, to leave Ukraine. Delone moved to Petrograd in\n1922\n. Petrograd was the name that St Petersburg had been given in\n1914\nand, two years after Delone began working there, in\n1924\n, it was again renamed, this time to Leningrad. Delone worked at Leningrad University from\n1922\nuntil\n1935\n. In August\n1924\nhe attended the International Congress of Mathematicians in Toronto, Canada, where he delivered the invited address\nSur la sphÃ©re vide\nâ\n(\nOn the empty sphere\n)\n. Delone married and on\n22\nMay\n1926\nhis son Nikolai Borisovich Delone was born. Nikolai Borisovich became a professor of physics with a high international reputation in nuclear physics. Nikolai Borisovich's son Vadim Delone\n(\ngrandson of the subject of this biography\n)\nwas a famous poet and human-rights activist.\nThe\nSt Petersburg Mathematical Society\nhad been founded in\n1890\nbut disbanded at the time of the\n1917\nRevolution. However the Society was reformed in\n1921\nas the Petrograd Physical and Mathematical Society and Delone joined in the following year after his move to Petrograd. He played an active role in the Society along with other outstanding mathematicians such as Ya V Uspenskii,\nV I Smirnov\n,\nV A Steklov\n,\nA A Friedmann\n, V A Fok,\nA S Besicovitch\n,\nSergei Bernstein\n,\nYa D Tamarkin\n, R O Kuzmin and\nB G Galerkin\n. There he continued his interest in number theory, particularly the geometry of numbers, but he also worked on polyhedra, and on crystallography with important papers such as\nOn the question of the uniqueness of the determinations of the foundations of a parallelopiped crystal structure by the method of Debye\n(1926)\n. Regarding his work on polyhedra at this time,\nIgor Shafarevich\n(\nwho was a doctoral student of Delone\n)\nwrites\n[\n14\n]\n:-\nThe work of Boris Nikolaevich in the theory of polyhedra was in the theory of the regular partition of spaces, the elements of which were initiated by the crystallographer Pedorov and continued by Voronoi. In this field Boris Nikolaevich originated two deep methods - \"The method of the empty sphere\" and \"The method of the foliated construction\". These two methods decided the extraordinarily difficult problem of the determination of all regular partitions of ternary and quaternary spaces.\nIn number theory, Delone studied cubic fields, in particular investigating the correspondence between binary cubic forms and rings in cubic fields. He studied\nTschirnhaus\n's inverse problem, producing methods to determine whether or not two given cubic equations determine the same field. He invented a geometric method to tabulate all cubic rings whose\ndiscriminant\ndoes not exceed a given absolute value. He gave a geometric interpretation of binary cubics and their covariants which he then used in a reduction method.\nThe\n1917\nRevolution had made it impossible for Delone to go mountaineering for a number of years but he was able to start climbing again in the West Caucasus in\n1923\n. His favourite area for climbing, however, was the Russian portion of the Altai Mountains. The highest mountain in the range is the twin-peaked Mt Belukha reaching\n4500\nm in height. It is close to the point where Russia, Kazakhstan, China and Mongolia\n(\nalmost\n)\nmeet. The third highest mountain in the Altai range, the\n4070\nm Delone Peak, close to Mt Belukha, has been named after Delone. In addition to Delone Peak, there is also Delone Col and Delone Pass\n(3400\nm\n)\nleading to the Mensu glacier. In\n1930\nDelone was named \"Master of Soviet mountaineering\" and around the same time he organised mountaineering camps, being the first person to do so. He published the mountaineering guidebook\nThe peaks of the Western Caucasus\nin\n1938\n.\nThe Institute of Physics and Mathematics had been established by\nVladimir Andreevich Steklov\nin Petrograd\n(\nas it was called at the time\n)\nin\n1921\n. In\n1932\nthe Institute of Physics and Mathematics was divided into two independent Departments, the\nSteklov\nMathematical Institute headed by\nIvan Matveevich Vinogradov\nand the Lebedev Physics Institute headed by Sergei Ivanovich Vavilov.\nVinogradov\ninvited some outstanding mathematicians to join the new Mathematical Institute including Delone. In this new Mathematics Institute, Delone became a colleague of\nSergei Bernstein\n,\nN N Luzin\n,\nV I Smirnov\n, R O Kuzmin, N S Koshlyakov,\nN Y Kochin\n,\nS L Sobolev\nand\nD K Faddeev\n. From\n1932\nto\n1960\nDelone was Head of the Department of Algebra in\nSteklov\nMathematical Institute and from\n1960\nto\n1980\nhe was Head of the Department of Geometry. However, the\nSteklov\nMathematical Institute moved to Moscow and, in\n1935\nDelone also moved to Moscow. He was professor of mathematics at Moscow State University from\n1935\nto\n1943\n, being Head of the Department of Higher Geometry in the Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics. In\n1943\n, remaining at Moscow State University, he was made Professor of Higher Geometry and Topology, holding this position until\n1960\n.\nDelone published a number of important monographs. In\n1940\n, in collaboration with\nD K Faddeev\n, he published\nTheory of Irrationalities of Third Degree\n(\nRussian\n)\n. J V Uspensky begins a review as follows:-\nThe purpose of this outstanding monograph is to present all that is known at the present time about cubic irrationalities and such problems in number theory as are intimately connected with them. The book for the most part consists of the original investigations of its authors, and even that which has been contributed by other investigators is presented from a new and original point of view. Two features are very characteristic of the mode of presentation: on the one hand the extensive use of geometrical considerations as a background for the true understanding of complicated situations which otherwise would remain obscure, and on the other hand, the care shown by the authors in inventing effective methods of solution, illustrated by actual application to numerical examples and to the construction of valuable tables.\nThe importance of the book is clearly illustrated by the fact that in\n1964\nthe\nAmerican Mathematical Society\npublished an English translation of the treatise.\nIn\n1947\nDelone published\nThe St Petersburg school in the theory of numbers\n(\nRussian\n)\nwhich described the works of the early number theorists who worked at St Petersburg University, namely\nP L Chebyshev\n,\nA N Korkin\n,\nE I Zolotarev\n,\nA A Markov\n,\nG F Voronoy\nand\nI M Vinogradov\n. An English translation, published by the\nAmerican Mathematical Society\n, appeared in\n2005\n. In\n1948\nhe published the sixteen-page pamphlet\nMathematics and its development in Russia\n(\nRussian\n)\nand in the following years he published some further historical work with papers such as\nThe work of Gauss in number theory\n(1956)\n, written to mark the\n100\nth\nanniversary of the death of\nGauss\n, and\nEuler as a geometer\n(1958)\n, written to mark the\n250\nth\nanniversary of the birth of\nEuler\n. In the\n1960\ns he published\nX-rays and crystals,\n50\nyears since Max Laue's discovery\n(1962)\n,\nAn outline of the history of the development of mathematics in the Academy of Sciences of the USSR during the Soviet period\n(1917\n-\n1960)\n(1963)\n, and\nThe great French mathematician Josef Lagrange and his analytic mechanics\n(1963)\n.\nDelone was also involved with secondary school mathematics, and in\n1934\n, together with his pupil V A Tartakovskii, initiated and organized the first School Mathematics Olympiad. He also published a number of texts aimed at school pupils including\n(\nwith O K Zhitomirski\n)\nProblems with solutions for a revision course in elementary mathematics\n(1928)\n,\n(\nwith O K Zhitomirski\n)\nProblems in geometry\n(1935)\n,\nAnalytical geometry I\n(1948)\n, and\n(\nwith D A Raikov\n)\nAnalytical geometry II\n(1949)\n. His book\nA short exposition of the noncontradictoriness of the planimetry of Lobachevsky\n(1953)\nis aimed at those with no more than a secondary school education. N A Court praises the book, saying that it:-\n... is written with consummate skill and great care. The author takes only for granted the rudiments of the mathematical equipment of those for whom the book is intended. Figures are abundant\n(\nabout a hundred in all\n)\n. Nothing is dismissed cryptically as being \"perfectly obvious\". And when the phrase occurs, it is followed by a suitable explanation.\nAt Moscow State University, Delone taught a course on computers and in\n1952\npublished\nA short course in mathematical machines. Part\n1\n. Small computing machines and mathematical instruments\nwhich discussed calculators, the polar planimeter and other integrating instruments, and the construction and operation of a mechanical differential analyzer.\nAs a final comment let us note that in\n1947\nDelone published\nOn a duplicator linkage of Prof N B Delone\ncontaining a four-line proof of a result on linkages due to his father Nikolai Borisovich Delone.",
