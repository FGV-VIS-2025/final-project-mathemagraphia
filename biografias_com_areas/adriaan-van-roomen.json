  "biografia": "Adriaan van Roomen\nis often known by his Latin name\nAdrianus Romanus\n. His family probably came from Bergen op Zoom. His father, who was also named Adriaan van Roomen, was a merchant in Antwerp before settling in Leuven and his mother was Maria van den Daele. Adriaan and Maria van Roomen had three children, Jan, Maria and Adriaan\n(\nthe subject of this biography\n)\n. We know nothing of his childhood or youth.\nAfter studying ancient languages in his hometown, van Roomen studied mathematics and philosophy at the Jesuit College in Cologne. He studied medicine, first at Cologne and then at Leuven. He then spent some time in Italy in April\n1585\n, when he met\nChristopher Clavius\nin Rome. Seven years later, he referred to his meeting with\nClavius\nin a letter he wrote to him:-\nGreetings. Reverend Father, though now I might look unfamiliar to you, yet when the papal seat was vacant because of the death of Gregory XIII, being in Rome, your reverence usually met me. At that time we treated the subjects of arithmetic and mainly algebra.\nVan Roomen was professor of mathematics and medicine at Leuven from\n1586\nto\n1592\nand, for six months during\n1592\n, he was rector of the University. During this time he planned to publish an overview of the whole of mathematics\n[\n5\n]\n:-\nAs a first part of this project, he worked on a 'theoria polygonorum', a theory of the regular polygons. This should result in tables of sines, tangents and secants, and in a solution of the circle squaring problem, which for him meant the calculation of the proportion between the circumference and the diameter of a circle. The work was intended to have\n12\nchapters, of which the first four would treat the regular\n3\n-,\n4\n-,\n5\n- and\n15\n-gon, and the related polygons produced by a repeated doubling of the number of sides. Sections\n5\n-\n9\nwould treat all other regular polygons. In Chapters\n10\nand\n11\nvan Roomen would study the circle. Section\n10\nwould teach how to compute its circumference and area. Section\n11\nwould examine the many faulty or simply wrong solutions to the problem of squaring of the circle. Finally, Section\n12\nwould show how the necessary arithmetical operations can be carried out with the least difficulty.\nIn\n1591\n, van Roomen published\nOuranographia\n. This was his first work and it was essentially a work on astronomy, in particular on the number and nature of the heavenly spheres of\nPtolemy\n. In\n1593\nthe first part of his overview of mathematics appeared, namely\nIdeae mathematicae pars prima, sive Methodus Polygonorum\n. This contained the first four chapters from the total of twelve that he had planned. Although some of his later publications contained sections that might have been intended as part of the remaining eight chapters, he never completed his grand plan.\nAfter these years in Leuven, van Roomen went to WÃ¼rzburg where again he was appointed professor of medicine giving his first lecture on\n17\nMay\n1593\n. Although there was an earlier attempt to found this university, the Julius-Maximilians University of WÃ¼rzburg was permanently endowed and established in\n1582\non the initiative of Prince Bishop Julius Echter von Mespelbrunn\n(1545\n-\n1617)\n. Van Roomen's appointment by Prince Bishop Julius Echter von Mespelbrunn was officially confirmed on the last day of August\n1593\n. It is likely that van Roomen was glad to have an opportunity to leave the Netherlands since there was much unrest and fighting over the Spanish held territory. It was around the end of\n1593\nthat van Roomen married Anna Steeg, the niece of Godefrid Steeg who was the doctor to Prince Bishop Julius Echter von Mespelbrunn. Although he was employed as a professor of medicine, it was mathematics that was van Roomen's real love. However, at WÃ¼rzburg he did not have as much time to devote to mathematics as he would have liked. Partly this was because his health was poorly and partly it was because of his duties - he was dean of the medical school in\n1596\n, in\n1599\nand for a third time in\n1602\n. However, he did get involved in some mathematical work.\nVan Roomen had proposed a problem which involved solving an equation of degree\n45\nin\nIdeae mathematicae\n(1593)\n. The problem, which was given in the form of a challenge to \"mathematicians all over the world\", was solved by\nFranÃ§ois ViÃ¨te\nwho realised that there was an underlying trigonometric relation.\nViÃ¨te\n's solution was published in\n1595\nand, at the end of his booklet, he proposed the Apollonian Problem of drawing a circle to touch three given circles. Van Roomen solved it using two\nhyperbolas\n, publishing the result in\n1596\n.\nViÃ¨te\npublished a ruler and compass solution to the Apollonian Problem in\n1600\nwhich greatly impressed van Roomen\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nVan Roomen was so impressed by\nViÃ¨te\n's mathematical talent that he visited France to recover his health and personally met his French rival in the summer of\n1601\n. On his arrival in Paris, he was told that\nViÃ¨te\nwas in Poitou and travelled there to talk with him. It is said they spent a month together and were very friendly.\nA dispute with the French scholar Josephus Justus Scaliger\n(1540\n-\n1609)\nprompted van Roomen to publish further works. Scaliger announced in\n1590\nthat had solved the three classic problems of squaring the circle, trisecting an angle and\nduplicating the cube\n. He published his 'proofs' of the first two of these in pamphlets in\n1594\nand in these he also claimed that\nArchimedes\n' method of computing the area of a circle is worthless. Van Roomen bought Scaliger's pamphlet on squaring the circle from a book fair in Frankfurt in the autumn of\n1594\n. In November of that year he wrote to\nClavius\nsaying he was astonished that Scaliger had dared to publish such a work. He wrote to Scaliger pointing out errors in his work and eventually Scaliger wrote an appendix 'correcting' the errors. He sent a copy to van Roomen in March\n1595\n. Van Roomen decided to publish a work defending\nArchimedes\nfrom Scaliger's attacks. Scaliger had stated that\nArchimedes\n' method of calculating the area of a circle was useless since he was using an arithmetical method to solve a geometrical problem. Van Roomen's response was the three-part book\nIn Archimedis Circuli Dimensionem Expositio et Analysis\n(1597)\n. The first part contains a Latin translation by van Roomen of the Greek text of\nArchimedes\n'\nOn the measurement of the circle\n. In the second part he defends\nArchimedes\nfrom Scaliger's attack introducing a concept he calls 'mathesis universalis'. Van Roomen claims:-\nThere is a science common to geometry and arithmetic which considers quantity generally as measurable.\nIn more detail he states:-\nSurely there is a certain science common to arithmetic and geometry to which properties common to all quantities pertain: since a proportion is common to all quantities, not only abstract ones such as numbers and magnitudes, but also concrete ones such as times, sounds, voices, places, motions, and forces\n(\nfor all these and many others are said to have a proportion if their relation is considered from the viewpoint of quantity\n)\n.\nVan Roomen proposes unifying geometry and arithmetic under his concept of 'mathesis universalis'. The importance of these ideas must be their influence on\nDescartes\n' use of algebra for geometric problems. The third part of van Roomen's\n1597\nwork, consisting of ten dialogues, points out the errors in Scaliger's attempt to square the circle and also points out the errors in the works of several other mathematicians including\nOronce Fine\nwho had made similar claims.\nDuring the ten years\n1593\n-\n1603\nthat van Roomen spent in WÃ¼rzburg he supervised the dissertations of twenty students which were printed by the local printer Georgius Fleischmann. Most treat medical or anatomical subjects, but there is one on astronomy and one on meteorology. From\n1596\nto\n1603\nhe was also \"mathematician\"  of the chapter in WÃ¼rzburg, his main duty being to annually draw up the calendar. It appears that his wife Anna died during these years; they had no children. In\n1603\nvan Roomen gave up his duties as professor at WÃ¼rzburg, requesting permission from Prince Bishop Julius to travel to Leuven on\n19\nMarch\n1603\n. From\n1603\nto\n1610\nhe lived frequently in both Leuven and WÃ¼rzburg although he did not officially resign his WÃ¼rzburg professorship until\n1607\n. He was ordained a priest in Leuven in\n1604\nor\n1605\n. He was made a canon at the church of Saint John of WÃ¼rzburg on\n1\nOctober\n1605\nbut, due to the many travels he undertook, he seems to have failed to fulfil all his obligations as a canon and he was reprimanded in November\n1609\n. In September\n1610\nhe requested that he be given leave from his duties as a canon for two years, but that he might continue to be paid. His request for continued payment was refused. The reason for this request was that van Roomen had been invited to the Zamoyski Academy in Zamosc, Poland. This academy had been founded in\n1594\nby the Polish Crown Chancellor Jan Zamoyski\n(1542\n-\n1605)\n.\nWe have accurate details of van Roomen's travels from WÃ¼rzburg to Zamosc preserved in the diary of the Polish mathematician Jan Brozek\n(1585\n-\n1652)\n, also known as Ioannes Broscius or Johannes Broscius, who worked at KrakÃ³w Academy\n(\nnow the Jagiellonian University\n)\n. He noted the days that van Roomen spent in KrakÃ³w in his travels between WÃ¼rzburg and Zamosc. Van Roomen arrived in KrakÃ³w on\n24\nAugust\n1611\nafter spending about a year in Zamosc. He spent time studying in KrakÃ³w University library before returning on\n1\nSeptember to WÃ¼rzburg. Two months later he was back in KrakÃ³w, travelling on to Zamosc on\n29\nOctober. After teaching for ten months at the Zamoyski Academy in Zamosc, he stayed in KrakÃ³w from\n12\nto\n18\nAugust\n1612\non his way back to WÃ¼rzburg. It is clear that by this time van Roomen was sufficiently concerned about his health that, in\n1613\n, he travelled to Leuven where he made a will. After returning to WÃ¼rzburg in April\n1613\n, he added a codicil detailing his wishes about his property in WÃ¼rzburg. Some of his possessions were left to Prince Bishop Julius Echter while his property was left to his sister Maria van den Brouck. Returning to Leuven later in the same month, he visited a Spa in an attempt to improve his health.\nAlthough van Roomen had no children with his wife Anna, nevertheless he had two sons Jacob and Koenraad with Catharina Trauthmann. Jacob became a medical doctor in Leuven and died there in\n1635\nwhile Koenraad was born in Nuremberg and became an apothecary in Leuven, dying there in\n1668\n. Van Roomen died in Mainz while on a journey from Leuven to WÃ¼rzburg. He was travelling with his son Jacob and died in Jacob's arms.\nVan Roomen also wrote a commentary on\nal-Khwarizmi\n's\nAlgebra\nbut the only two known copies were destroyed in\n1914\nand\n1944\n(\nas a result of World War I and World War II\n)\n. However, before they were destroyed, copies of large parts of this work were made and these copies have survived. Here is a short extract from\n[\n5\n]\nwhere Paul Bockstaele gives a full and fascinating account of this work by van Roomen:-\nIn the Prolegomena to the edition of\nal-Khwarizmi\n's 'Algebra', van Roomen says that his intention is to examine what kind of science the algebra or 'ars analyticais', by looking at its origin and history. First of all he gives a summary of the different names which have been proposed for this science. Then he examines the place of the 'ars analytica' among the other sciences. It deals with quantities, their equality or inequality, their proportion and proportionality. For this reason it belongs to mathematics. Those who have written about algebra considered it to be a part of arithmetic, although it might as well be considered to be part of geometry. Algebraic propositions usually are demonstrated by geometrical constructions, so that algebra should perhaps better be considered as a part of geometry. Van Roomen ... prefers to classify the algebra or analytical science as belonging to the 'Mathesin prima', which deals with quantity in general. The material object of the 'ars analytica' or algebra is indeed quantity. The formal object, however, is the equality\n(\naequalitas\n)\nof quantities, since only those problems, in which some equation is either explicitly given or can be deduced from the data of the problem, are analytic.\nOne of van Roomen's most impressive results was finding Ï to\n16\ndecimal places. He did this in\n1593\nusing\n2\n30\n2^{30}\n2\n3\n0\nsided polygons. Van Roomen's interest in Ï was almost certainly as a result of his friendship with\nLudolph van Ceulen\n. Van Roomen worked on trigonometry and the calculation of chords in a circle. In\n1596\nRheticus\n's trigonometric tables\nOpus palatinum de triangulis\nwere published, many years after\nRheticus\ndied. Van Roomen was critical of the accuracy of these tables and wrote to\nClavius\nat the Collegio Romano in Rome pointing out that, to calculate tangent and secant tables correctly to ten decimal places, it was necessary to work to\n20\ndecimal places for small values of sine, see\n[\n3\n]\n. In\n1600\nvan Roomen visited Prague where he met\nJohannes Kepler\nand told him of his worries about the methods employed in\nRheticus\n's trigonometric tables.\nAmong other contributions made by van Roomen was one to figures of equal perimeter.\nPappus\nhad proved a number of results concerning the maximum area of polygons of equal perimeter. For example regular\nn\nn\nn\n-sided polygons have the maximum area among all\nn\nn\nn\n-sided polygons of fixed perimeter. Van Roomen generalised the results of\nPappus\nand, again showing his precise thinking, realised that 'regular' had not been properly defined. His work in this area is discussed in detail in\n[\n9\n]\n.",
