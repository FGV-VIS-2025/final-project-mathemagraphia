  "biografia": "Walter GrÃ¶bli\n(\noriginally Walther GrÃ¶bli\n)\nspent his childhood and attended primary school in his native village of Oberuzwil. Later the family moved to TÃ¶ss\n(\nnow part of the town Winterthur\n)\nin canton ZÃ¼rich, where Walter attended the Industrieschule. His parents were Isaak and Elisabetha GrÃ¶bli, nÃ©e Grob. Walter had two older brothers, Joseph Arnold and Hermann, and a younger sister. His four younger brothers all died in their infancy.\nIsaak GrÃ¶bli\n(1822\n-\n1917)\nwas a jacquard weaver who invented the \"Schifflistickmaschine\", a shuttle embroidery machine, in\n1863\n. Soon the machine worked\n10\ntimes faster than a hand embroidery machine and became widely used, but it brought Isaak GrÃ¶bli only modest wealth. At the age of\n64\nhe moved to Gossau\n(\ncanton St. Gallen\n)\nto set up his own small embroidery business, supported by his son Hermann. The oldest son Arnold emigrated to the United States in\n1876\n, where he refined his father's invention. Letters preserved in GrÃ¶bli's scientific estate\n[\n2\n]\nshow that Arnold took an interest in his younger brother's career.\nWalter, however, was not interested in weaving, but in mathematics. He completed his school education at the Kantonsschule in St. Gallen. Encouraged and supported by his father, he studied mathematics at the Polytechnic from\n1871\n-\n1875\n, at the Department for Mathematics and Physics Teachers. His lecturers included\nHeinrich Weber\nand\nSchwarz\n, 'both of whom had great influence on his further scientific career'\n[\n5\n]\n.\nWeber\nin particular got GrÃ¶bli, whom he referred to as the 'best student he had ever had'\n[\n6\n]\n, interested in vortex theory and hydrodynamics. Probably encouraged by\nWeber\nand\nSchwarz\n, GrÃ¶bli went to Berlin to hear\nKirchhoff\n,\nHelmholtz\n,\nKummer\nand\nWeierstrass\nin\n1875\n. In Berlin he caused a stir by solving the prize problem on vortex motion posed by\nKirchhoff\n.\nIn\n1876\nGrÃ¶bli obtained his doctorate from the University of GÃ¶ttingen for his thesis\nSpezielle Probleme Ã¼ber die Bewegung gradliniger, paralleler WirbelflÃ¤chen\nâ\n(\nSpecial problems on rectilinear movement, parallel vortex sheets\n)\n. His supervisor was\nSchwarz\n(\nor possibly\nHeinrich Weber\n)\n; his oral examiners were\nSchwarz\nfor mathematics and\nJohann Benedict Listing\nfor physics. Upon his return to ZÃ¼rich in\n1877\nhe\nhabilitated\nas\nPrivatdozent\nat the Polytechnic. Along with the request he had to submit at least two papers and three references; his referees were\nWilhelm Fiedler\n,\nFrobenius\n, and\nGeiser\n. The whole process, from application to appointment, took a remarkable two weeks\n[\n2\n]\n. GrÃ¶bli also became\nFrobenius\n's assistant for the following six years. He held his teaching post until\n1894\n; he mainly lectured on hydrodynamics.\nIn\n1883\nhe was appointed professor of mathematics at the\nGymnasium\nin ZÃ¼rich. By all accounts he was a very demanding\n(\nschool\n)\nteacher, but impressed his pupils with 'his phenomenal proficiency in mental arithmetic, which is not widely spread among higher mathematicians and of which astounding stories were told'\n[\n6\n]\n. Despite his mathematical talent and encouragement from his former professors and his colleagues, GrÃ¶bli did not pursue a career as a research mathematician; he was content with being a schoolteacher.\nGrÃ¶bli married Emma Bodmer in\n1899\nand they had a son, Walter\n(1900\n-\n1975)\n[\n2\n]\n.\nEven after he had stepped down from his post at the Polytechnic, GrÃ¶bli continued to take great interest in the latest mathematical research. He was also very interested in languages, reading English and German literature, and learning Italian in his forties.\nHis main passion\n(\nbesides mathematics\n)\nthough was mountaineering. He climbed most of the more major peaks in the Alps; in many cases he was the first person to do so. Examples are climbing Piz Ela\n(3339\nm\n)\nin\n1880\nand traversing the north route of the TÃ¶di\n(3614\nm\n)\n. In addition, he was a keen hiker. GrÃ¶bli was a very active member of the Swiss Alpine Club: he led many mountaineering trips and served on the executive committee of the Club's local branch for many years. He also wrote several reports on his excursions for the Club's journal. A letter from the Federal Topographic Bureau\n[\n3\n]\nsuggests that GrÃ¶bli combined his two passions in measuring the heights of mountains and mountain passes.\nOn\n26\nJune\n1903\n, he led a group of\n16\nof his pupils on a hike on Piz Blas\n(3019\nm, canton Grisons\n)\n. Due to bad weather conditions, the group had to choose a different route, but they were still caught in an avalanche. Walter GrÃ¶bli and two pupils, Ernst Hofmann and Adolf Odermatt, perished on the mountain; another pupil, Richard Liebmann, died of his injuries later on.\nIt is hard to say whether GrÃ¶bli would have written any mathematical papers had he not died so early. But as it stands his only publication was his doctoral thesis. The basic model that he investigated had been discovered by his former professor Helmholtz\n(\nCrelle's Journal,\n1858)\n, but\n[\n5\n]\n:-\nThe subject matter\n[\nof GrÃ¶bli's thesis\n]\nwas the motion of three vortices, the motion of four vortices assuming the existence of an axis of symmetry, and the motion of\n2\nn\n2n\n2\nn\nvortices assuming the existence of\nn\nn\nn\nsymmetry axes.\nHe had already worked on a similar topic for his dissertation at the Polytechnic. The thesis was cited a number of times in the late\n19\nth\ncentury, by\nG R Kirchhoff\n, D N Goryachev and\nH Lamb\nfor example. People then forgot about it until\n1949\n, when\nJ L Synge\npublished a paper on the converse of the problem that GrÃ¶bli investigated. The thesis is still cited today, in fact, 'few will write a thesis that will be the subject of attention a century later'\n[\n5\n]\n.\nAt the time of the first International Congress of Mathematicians GrÃ¶bli had already given up his teaching post at the Polytechnic. He joined the enlarged organising committee in December\n1896\n. At the meeting on\n08\nDecember he was elected president of the finance committee\n(\none of the four sub-committees\n)\n. As such he was responsible for creating the committee's budget and asking individuals\n(\nmerchants, manufacturers etc.\n)\nfor donations.",
