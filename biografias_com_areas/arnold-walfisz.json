  "biografia": "Arnold Walfisz\nis also known as\nVal'fish\nand as\nVal'fiÅ¡\n. His father was Zelman Walfisz; the family were of Jewish origins. Arnold grew up in Warsaw where he attended the Sixth State\nGymnasium\nand was awarded his Abitur in\n1909\n. Later that same year, he went to Germany to begin his university education.\nPerhaps we should look a little at the political situation at this time in order to understand the times in which Walfisz lived. Poland had ceased to become an independent country in\n1795\nwhen it was divided between Russia, Prussia and Austria. Warsaw was controlled by the Russians and, after various unsuccessful uprisings by Polish nationalists, a period of Russification followed. In particular, Warsaw University became a Russian university and much was spent on building a new campus. Walfisz preferred to go to Germany for his university studies. There he undertook the type of education which was typical of German students of this time, moving between various different German universities. In particular, he studied at the major German mathematical centres of Munich, Berlin, Heidelberg and GÃ¶ttingen.\nWalfisz was in the middle of his university studies when World War I began in\n1914\n. Of course this war put Polish people in a somewhat difficult position since Poland was partitioned between countries which were on opposing sides. Most Poles sided with Central Powers which included Germany and Austria-Hungary, opposing the Allies mainly because they wished to be free of Russian domination. Walfisz, however, was not able to continue his education for the duration of the war, only being able to resume his studies in\n1918\n. We have been unable to determine exactly what he did during the four years of the war. When he resumed his studies he undertook research for his doctorate, advised by\nEdmund Landau\nat the Georg-August University of GÃ¶ttingen. He published his first paper\nÃber die Nichtfortsetzbarkeit einiger durch Dirichletsche Reihen definierter Funktionen\nâ\n(\nOn the non-continuity of some functions defined by Dirichlet series\n)\n, written jointly with his thesis advisor Edmund Landau, in\n1920\n. He submitted his\n56\n-page thesis,\nÃber die summatorischen Funktionen einiger Dirichletsher Reihen\nâ\n(\nA summary of some functions gven by Dirichlet series\n)\nto GÃ¶ttingen towards the end of\n1921\nand was awarded his doctorate in the following year.\nWalfisz was not in a strong position to obtain a university post. As a Jew he was discriminated against within his own country of Poland, and as a Pole, he was discriminated against in Germany. We do not suggest that this made obtaining a post impossible, but it certainly made it much more difficult. Walfisz went to Wiesbaden after the award of his thesis and lived there for five years during which he produced many fine papers. He published four papers in\n1924\n, three in\n1925\n, one in\n1926\nand nine in\n1927\n. All these papers were written in German, with the exception of\nThe lattice points of a circle\n(\na joint paper with\nJ E Littlewood\n, written in English and published in\n1924\nby the\nRoyal Society of London\n)\nand\nNew results in the theory of numbers\n(\nPolish\n)\npublished in\n1925\n.\nWalfisz had wanted to return to GÃ¶ttingen and work with\nEdmund Landau\n. Indeed,\nLandau\nwas also very keen to have Walfisz as an assistant so made application to the Rockefeller Foundation for financial support. However, despite the obviously strong academic case for such an award to be made, it was turned down by the Rockefeller Foundation. The reasons for turning down the application is discussed in\n[\n1\n]\nwhere two main reasons are suggested. First, the official reason was that\nEdmund Landau\n:-\n... wished to engage him as a Private Assistant, in order to finish up an important piece of work on which he was engaged.\nThis reason was not in any way Walfisz's fault, yet it was he who would be the loser. A second reason for turning down the application was the following\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nIn the case of a candidate from \"a somewhat scientifically backward country\", there must be some indication that the home people will find a suitable place for him on his return from abroad. ... we have learnt from experience it is not profitable to take many men from the backward countries and help them to come to western Europe for what one might call general advanced training.\nOf course, calling Poland at this time \"a somewhat scientifically backward country\" is rather ridiculous for mathematics flourished in Poland between the wars. However, it was certainly true that Walfisz would have had no \"suitable place for him on his return from abroad\".\nIn\n1927\nhe returned to Warsaw where he took a job as a Mathematician with the Europa Insurance Company. He\nhabilitated\nat the University of Warsaw in\n1930\nand taught there as a\ndocent\n. However, he had to continue to earn a living with the insurance company since he was not paid for his university teaching. However, he lived most of the time in Radosc, a town halfway between Warsaw and Bialystok. Many of the papers that Walfisz published after returning to Poland give his affiliation as Warsaw but his address as Radosc. In\n1935\nWalfisz, together with Salomon Lubelski, founded the number theory journal\nActa Arithmetica\n. He became a member of the editorial board and he published four papers in the journal around this time, two in\n1935\n((\nwith Sarvadaman Chowla\n)\nÃber eine Riemannsche IdentitÃ¤t\nâ\n(\nOn a Riemann identity\n)\nand\nZur additiven Zahlentheorie\nâ\n(\nOn additive number theory\n)\n)\n, and two in the following year\n(\nÃber Gitterpunkte in mehrdimensionalen Ellipsoiden V\nâ\n(\nSuperlattice points in multidimensional ellipsoids V\n)\nand\nTeilerprobleme V\nâ\n(\nDivision problems V\n)\n)\n. Let us note that Sarvadaman D S Chowla was an Indian mathematician who had studied for his doctorate at the University of Cambridge advised by\nJohn Edensor Littlewood\n. He obtained a doctorate in\n1931\nfor the thesis\nContributions To The Analytic Theory Of Numbers\n. In the same year Walfisz and Chowla had co-authored the paper\nOn a trigonometric sum\npublished by the\nLondon Mathematical Society\n.\nThe political situation in Poland was, by this time, rapidly deteriorating. Jozef Pilsudski, considered to be the founder of modern Poland, died in\n1935\nand a succession of military leaders ran the country. Border disputes with Germany and the USSR increased the instability and the Nazis looked ever more threatening to their neighbours and to all those of Jewish descent. Some Poles had already found positions in the USSR, such as Chaim\n(\nHermann\n)\nMÃ¼ntz, who had left Berlin to take up a chair for analysis at Leningrad in\n1929\n. He influenced the Georgian University of Tbilisi to make Walfisz the offer of a position there. In October\n1936\nWalfisz accepted and began a career in Tbilisi. However, a look at the addresses on his letters he sent show that he visited Tbilisi before taking up the permanent appointment. For example, he corresponded with\nLouis Joel Mordell\n, who was at the University of Manchester, sending him several letters from Radosc from June\n1934\nto March\n1935\n. However, he was in Tbilisi in January\n1936\n, back in Radosc in August\n1936\n, but writing from Tbilisi in October\n1936\n. Similarly, he corresponded with\nHarold Davenport\n, all his letters between\n1930\nand\n1936\nbeing sent from Radosc.\nTaking up permanent residence in Tbilisi in October\n1936\n, Walfisz was appointed as a Senior Researcher at Tbilisi Mathematical Institute and as Professor of Mathematics at Tbilisi State University. From\n1937\nto\n1940\n, he was Head of the Department of Number Theory at the Tbilisi Mathematical Institute and, from\n1940\nto\n1944\nhe was Head of the Department of Theoretical Mathematics. He also served as Head of the Department of Algebra and Geometry at the Tbilisi Mathematical Institute from\n1948\nto\n1962\n. For part of this time, from\n1947\nto\n1953\n, he was also a Professor at the Tbilisi Pedagogical Institute. The authors of\n[\n6\n]\nwrite:-\nBesides leading an intense scientific life Professor A Z Walfisz was active in many aspects of teaching. He gave lectures on different branches of mathematics at Tbilisi University and at the Tbilisi and Kutaisi Pedagogical Institutes. Moreover, he did a lot of work in training number theorists, a specialty that was not represented before in Georgia. His pupils now work prolifically in many educational establishments and Universities in the Republic of Georgia.\nWe have already seen something of his mathematics output, but this is summed up in\n[\n6\n]\nas follows:-\nWalfisz published\n100\nscientific works in different branches of mathematics, mainly in number-theory. They were written in several languages and brought him world-wide recognition. The favourite field of research of Arnold Walfisz was the theory of integral points in ellipsoids, to which he devoted about thirty papers and a monograph.\nHe published\nGitterpunkte in Mehrdimensionalen Kugeln\nâ\n(\nGrid points in multidimensional spheres\n)\nin\n1957\n. This German text was published in Warsaw by the\nPolish Academy of Sciences\n, but a Russian version of the text was published in Tbilisi by the\nGeorgian Academy of Sciences\n.\nE M Wright\n, reviewing the German text, writes\n[\n10\n]\n:-\nThe author's style of exposition is as limpidly clear as\nLandau\n's and the book could be read with especial profit by anyone commencing work as a mathematical author. The beautiful theory is due to a sequence of celebrated mathematicians, including\nLandau\n,\nHardy\n,\nJarnik\n,\nVinogradov\n, van der Corput and, most of all, Professor Walfisz himself. The book includes a detailed account of sources and a brief account of results in the more general problem for ellipsoids.\nS Chowla, reviewing the same book, writes\n[\n3\n]\n:-\nThis is a beautifully written book by a leading expert in the field. Although of immense value to the specialist, it is addressed to a wider circle of readers.\nWalfisz published further monographs:\nPell's equation\n(\nRussian\n)\n(1952)\n;\nLattice points in many-dimensional spheres\n(\nRussian\n)\n(1960)\n; and\nWeylsche Exponentialsummen in der neueren Zahlentheorie\nâ\n(\nWeyl exponential sums in modern number theory\n)\n(1963)\n. The first of these was in the\nGeorgian Academy of Sciences\n' popular science series. B J Birch, reviewing the\n1963\nwork, writes:-\nThis book contains a very detailed exposition of exponential sum estimates of N M Korobov and\nI M Vinogradov\n, and of the application of these estimates to obtain sharp results in the analytic theory of numbers.\nWe mentioned above that Walfisz co-founded the journal\nActa Arithmetica\n, and served on the editorial board, when he was working in Warsaw. After he left Poland and went to Georgia in\n1936\nhe could not continue with his editorial work on this journal and the journal ceased publication during World War II. However, after the\nPolish Academy of Sciences\nwas founded in\n1952\n, the Academy took over publication of the journal and invited Walfisz to join the editorial board. He served on the board for the rest of his life. Also, during the years he worked in Tbilisi, he served on the editorial board of the journal\nTrudy Tbiliss koi matematicheskogo institut im. A M Razmadze Akademii Nauk Gruzinskoi SSR\n. He also undertook other editorial work\n[\n6\n]\n:-\nWalfisz also prepared the Russian translation of\nL E Dickson\n's \"Introduction to the Theory of Numbers\", which he considerably augmented and revised. Also worthy of mention is\nEdmund Landau\n's monograph \"Diophantische Gleichungen mit endlich vielen LÃ¶sungen\", which was published in\n1959\nby the German scientific press in Berlin\n(\nDDR\n)\nwith a large supplement by Walfisz. The same press entrusted him, as a prominent pupil of\nEdmund Landau\n, with the publication of a collection of the papers of\nLandau\non integral points. This appeared under the title \"AusgewÃ¤hlte Abhandlungen zur Gitterpunktlehre\"\nâ\n(\nSelected Essays on the grid point rules\n)\nwith an extensive commentary by Walfisz.\nWe must not give the impression that all of Walfisz's mathematical contributions were in number theory for he also contributed papers on the theory of ideals in rings, on function theory, and the theory of modular forms.",
