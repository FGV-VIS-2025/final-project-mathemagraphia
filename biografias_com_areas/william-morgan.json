  "biografia": "William Morgan\n, F.R.S. was born in Wales and originally studied medicine at Guy's Hospital in London. Although originally intending to follow his father's profession as a doctor, William Morgan did not follow that profession. Instead, following the recommendation from his uncle\nDr Richard Price\n, D.D., F.R.S.\n(1723\n-\n1791)\n-- a Doctor of Divinity and a honorary LL.D. from Yale University in the U.S.A. -- Morgan joined Equitable Life in\n1774\nas Assistant Actuary.\nThe early work on probability is described by Hald\n[\n34\n]\n. Work on mortality and annuities had been carried out by\nHalley\n[\n35\n]\n,\n[\n36\n]\nand\n[\n37\n]\nin the late\n17\nth\ncentury and by\nAbraham De Moivre\n[\n22\n]\nand\n[\n23\n]\nat the beginning on the\n18\nth\ncentury.\nSimpson\nwrote a book on annuities and reversions in\n1742\n(\n[\n44\n]\nand\n[\n45\n]\n)\n. Wallace, Webster and\nMaclaurin\nundertook, in\n1744\n, the actuarial calculations for the Scottish Ministers' Widows Pension Fund\n[\n29\n]\nand\n[\n32\n]\n. The history of actuarial science is described in\n[\n33\n]\n.\nThe\nSociety for Equitable Assurances on Lives and Survivorships\nwas established in\n1762\n. It was the first life office anywhere in the world to be established on the sound scientific principles of\n1756\nof James Dodson\n(\nc.\n1710\n-\n1757)\n(\n[\n25\n]\n,\n[\n26\n]\n,\n[\n27\n]\nand\n[28])\nwho had been made an F.R.S. in\n1755\n. James Dodson F.R.S. had understood the need, in a life office, for the premium to be based on the age of the policyholder at the policy's outset and had set out the cash flows that would arise each year in future, if such policies were effected.\nJames Dodson, who had been a pupil of\nDe Moivre\n, held the mastership of mathematics at the Royal Mathematical School attached to Christ's Hospital, London. He was the great grandfather of\nAugustus de Morgan\nwho married the daughter of William Frend\n(1758\n-\n1827)\n, Actuary of the Rock Insurance Company and who had been\n2\nnd\nWrangler\nin the Cambridge Mathematics Tripos of\n1780\n.\nRemarkably, given his training as a minister,\nDr Richard Price\nwas, inter alia, an important contributor to, and a important pioneer in, the subject of life assurance mathematics, which was evolving in the\n18\nth\ncentury. But\nPrice\nhad been taught by John Eames, F.R.S. who had been a pupil of the great\nSir Isaac Newton\n. His knowledge of life contingencies was so good that he was invited to be an adviser to the Society from\n1768\nto his death in\n1791\n. As author of the book,\nObservations on Reversionary Payments\n[\n42\n]\n, published in\n1771\n,\nPrice\nestablished his reputation and acknowledged expertise in the field of life assurance mathematics. The book ran to seven editions and became a standard work on life contingencies. It is noted that it is to\nDr Price\nthat we owe the publication of the work of\nThomas Bayes\n(\nBayes' Theorem in\nprobability\n)\n(\n[\n20\n]\nand\n[\n41\n]\n)\nin the\nTransactions of the Royal Society of London\n.\nDr Price\nwas well known in America and particularly to\nBenjamin Franklin\nand was a keen supporter of American independence\n(\nhence the Yale, LLD\n)\n.\nIt is apparent that, prior to joining the Society, William Morgan knew little mathematics. It is recorded that he was asked by his uncle,\nDr Price\n, whether he knew mathematics. Tellingly, William replied \"No uncle, but I can learn\". That reply started William on his career at Equitable Life.\nIt is clear that\nPrice\nrecognised that an excellent mathematical knowledge of life contingencies was essential to the proper running of a life insurance company on scientific principles. The tuition that William Morgan received from\nDr Price\n(\nand Morgan's will to learn\n)\nmust have been so good that in\n1775\n, only a year after joining Equitable Life, William Morgan was appointed the Actuary of the Society. R. Price's book of\n1771\n,\nObservations on Reversionary Payments\n[\n42\n]\nmust have formed part of Morgan's early study. It is clear that by editing and publishing\nPrice\n's works\n(\n[\n9\n]\n,\n[\n13\n]\n,\n[\n14\n]\n,\n[\n15\n]\nand\n[\n46\n]\n)\n, Morgan recognised the debt which he owed to\nPrice\nin helping to establish him\n(\nMorgan\n)\nas the pre-eminent actuary of his time and father of the actuarial profession.\nWilliam Morgan, FRS, held, from\n1775\nto\n1830\n(\ni.e. for\n55\nyears\n)\nthe position in the Society called the 'Actuary', retiring at the advanced age of\n80\n(\nand William's son, Arthur, was to hold that position for the next\n40\nyears\n)\n. It was because of the name of William's position at Equitable Life that the name 'actuary' was given to professionals in insurance matters. A history of William Morgan and his contribution to the actuarial profesion is given in\n[\n30\n]\nand\n[\n31\n]\n. A history of what we now know as the Equitable Life Assurance Society is given in\n[\n40\n]\nand\n[\n47\n]\n.\nIn\n1774\n[\n43\n]\n,\nPrice\nwas concerned that the Directors were insuffuciently informed in regard to the financial state of the Society. He therefore proposed that a\nprospective\nvaluation of outstanding policyholders' liabilities be carried out, which would reveal the financial state of the Society and demonstrate whether it had surplus assets over and above that required to meet it liabilities.\nPrice\nalso recommended that Equitable's mortality experience should be compared with the mortality experience used in calculating Equitable's premiums.\nPrice\nrecommended caution and not to distribute too much of the surplus assets\n(\nif such there be\n)\nto policyholders since there might be future years of poor mortality experience.\nSuch calculations were carried out by William Morgan, by this time Actuary of the Society. As at\n1\nJanuary\n1776\n, Morgan therefore made the first\nprospective\nvaluation of a life office liabilities anywhere in the world\n(\nalmost certainly on Dodson's premium basis using the actuarial formula\n(\nP\nx\n+\nn\nâ\nP\nn\n)\na\nx\n+\nn\nâ²\nâ²\n(P_{x+n} -  P_{n}) a''_{x+n}\n(\nP\nx\n+\nn\nâ\nâ\nP\nn\nâ\n)\na\nx\n+\nn\nâ²\nâ²\nâ\ni.e. London mortality and at\n3\n% interest\n)\n. The calculations were carried out by hand, policy by policy\n(\nthere were of the order of\n1\n,\n000\npolicies\n)\nand it must have required much work to determine the value of policyholder liabilities\n(\nhow William Morgan would have appreciated a computer to do the work for him!\n)\n.\nHe compared his valuation of policyholder liabilities with the corresponding value of the Society's assets. There were surplus assets of about Â£\n25\n,\n000\nin\n1776\n[\n40\n]\n. Morgan published his methods and the underlying theory in\n1779\nin a book entitled\nThe Doctrine of Annuities and Assurances\n(\n[\n1\n]\nand\n[\n16\n]\n)\nbut it is clear that\nDr Richard Price\nwas a major influence behind the content of the book and that\nPrice\nand Morgan were a formidable team.\nThe Society had initially used the London Mortality Table, which analysed the deaths in London between\n1728\nand\n1750\n, and an interest rate of\n3\n% to calculate premiums. The London Table had been prepared by James Dodson and derived from Corbyn Morris'\nObservations on the Past Growth and the Present State of the City of London\n,\n1728\n-\n1750\n. From\n1782\n, Equitable Life used the Northampton Mortality Table which analysed the deaths in the city of Northampton between\n1735\nand\n1780\n, with an addition of\n15\n%\n(\nthis addition was removed in\n1786)\nagain using\n3\n% interest. In\n1800\n, Morgan analysed Equitable Life's own mortality experience expressing it as a proportion of the mortality rates used in the premium basis, finding it to be about\n40\n% lighter than that used in the premium basis. Morgan also appreciated that there was such a thing as \"select\" mortality i.e. the reduced mortality for new entrants who had been recently underwritten by the life office. Morgan also anaysed the mortality experience of Equitable Life dividing the cause of death into\n35\ncategories --\nMorgan's Nostological Table\n[\n16\n]\nwhich was the first analysis of \"cause-of-death\". In\n1829\n(\n[\n17\n]\nand\n[\n33\n]\n)\nMorgan published a mortality table represnting the mortality experience of Equitable Life.\nPrice\nand Morgan both understood that if the mortality rates and/or interest experienced by a life office were less\n(\nmore\n)\nthan those which had been used to calculate the premiums at the policy's outset then a interest/mortality profit\n(\nloss\n)\nwould be made by the life office. In fierce opposition to certain policyholders, Price and Morgan both felt that only a proportion of the surplus assets could be distributed to policyholders.\nPrice\nand Morgan both felt that any distribution of surplus should be by way of an increase to the policy's claim value\n(\ni.e. as reversionary bonuses\n)\nrather than diminish the assets of the life company by distributing some of the surplus as an immediate cash payment to policyholders. In his rÃ´le as Actuary, Morgan insisted that a valuation of policyholder liabilites should be carried out before any distribution of surplus to policyholders was made and that not more than two-thirds of the surplus should be distributed to policyholders as reversionary bonuses\n(\ni.e. additions to the sum assured\n)\n. This was partly to have a reserve in case of deteriorating mortality and partly to suit the bonus method which depended on how long the policyholder had been with Equitable Life since the policy started\n(\nand not just on the period in force since the last declaration of surplus\n)\n.\nIn\n1786\n, in return for taking off the\n15\n% addition to premiums which had been levied\n(\nsee para. above\n)\n, the sums assured under the policies were increased by\n1\n% for every year that the policy had been in force prior to\n1786\n. Thus the year\n1786\nmarks the first declaration of revisionary bonus\n[\n21\n]\n.\nIn\n1789\n, Morgan received the Copley Medal of the\nRoyal Society\nfor his first two papers on life assurance mathematics. In his total of five papers\n(\n[\n4\n]\n,\n[\n5\n]\n,\n[\n6\n]\n,\n[\n7\n]\nand\n[\n8\n]\n)\nto the\nRoyal Society\n, he showed\n(\nwithout any use of the integral calculus\n)\nhow the present value of assurances contingent on the survival of one life beyond another should be calculated. He extended this to the value of assurances contingent on the survivorship of three lives. Shortly thereafter, in\n1790\n, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. Even here, one detects influence of\nR Price\n, made F.R.S. in\n1765\n.\nMorgan's analysis is not quite right as he assumes that if two lives,\nx\nx\nx\nand\ny\ny\ny\n(\nx\nx\nx\nbeing the younger life\n)\nboth die within a given year\n(\nhaving both been alive at the start of the year\n)\n, then the probability of\ny\ny\ny\ndying first is always Â½. This is only true if\nx\nx\nx\nand\ny\ny\ny\nare the same age. In other cases, the probability of\ny\ny\ny\n(\nthe older\n)\ndying first is slightly greater than Â½, depending on the age difference between\nx\nx\nx\nand\ny\ny\ny\n.\nThe correct expression\n(\nusing modern notation\n)\n, if the payment is on the death of\nx\nx\nx\n, provided the order of deaths is\ny\n,\nz\n,\nx\ny, z, x\ny\n,\nz\n,\nx\n(\nassuming them to independent lives\n)\nis:-\nt\nA\nx\ny\nz\n3\n=\nâ«\n0\nâ\nÎ½\nt\n(\n1\nâ\nt\np\ny\n)\np\nx\nt\np\nz\nÎ¼\nz\n+\nt\nA\nx\n+\nt\nd\nt\n_{t} A^{3}_{xyz} = \\int _{0}^{â}  \\nu^{t} (1 - _{t} p_{y}) p_{xt} p_{z} \\mu_{z+t} A_{x+t} dt\nt\nâ\nA\nx\ny\nz\n3\nâ\n=\nâ«\n0\nâ\nâ\nÎ½\nt\n(\n1\nâ\nt\nâ\np\ny\nâ\n)\np\nx\nt\nâ\np\nz\nâ\nÎ¼\nz\n+\nt\nâ\nA\nx\n+\nt\nâ\nd\nt\nThe rather awkward looking integral can be valued by numerical methods for any mortality table for\nx\n,\ny\nx, y\nx\n,\ny\nand\nz\nz\nz\n.\nWilliam Morgan became well-known in insurance circles and by the end of the\n18\nth\ncentury he had established himself as the pre-eminent actuary in the U.K. He was consulted by Government when the National Debt Office began the sale of annuities in\n1808\n. Because of his renown, he was consulted by the life office, the Scottish Widows' Fund and Life Assurance Society at the time of its formation in\n1815\n[\n39\n]\n. He had a large practice in certifying the rules of Friendly Societies and did other consulting actuarial work e.g. the value of reversions. The Friendly Societies' Act of\n1819\nwas the first use of the word 'actuaries' in legislation.\nHe had a special interest in the state of the Public Finances\n(\nwhich were ballooning at the time\n)\nand wrote extensively on the subject\n(\n[\n9\n]\n,\n[\n10\n]\n,\n[\n11\n]\nand\n[\n12\n]\n)\ndisapproving of the Public Finances being allowed to become too large.\nAs well as being the Actuary of the Society, the first practical administrator of life assurance and a successful man of business, William Morgan conducted scientific experiments\n[\n2\n]\n,\n[\n3\n]\nand\n[\n19\n]\n. In\n1785\n, he communicated a paper to the\nRoyal Society\non the passage of electric discharges inside a glass tube. When there was a vacuum, no electric discharge could pass but by admitting a very small quantity of air the glass glowed a green colour. Although he did not know it, Morgan had produced X-rays\n110\nyears before RÃ¶ntgen in\n1895\n.\nWilliam's uncle\nRichard Price\nhad been an adviser to the Society from\n1768\n. William's first son, also called William Morgan\n(1791\n-\n1818)\n, entered Equitable Life but died at the age of\n28\n. William's fourth son, Arthur Morgan\n(1801\n-\n1870)\n, FRS, succeeded his father in\n1830\nas Actuary to Equitable Life holding the position for another\n40\nyears. William Morgan's grandson, also called William Morgan\n(1831\n-\n1897)\n, entered the Equitable but was never the Actuary. Thus, the Morgan and Price families were associated with Equitable Life for well over\n100\nyears and the name 'Morgan' is, in actuarial circles, forever associated with Equitable Life.",
