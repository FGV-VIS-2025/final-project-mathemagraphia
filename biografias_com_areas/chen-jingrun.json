  "biografia": "Chen Jingrun\nwas the son of Chen Yuanjun, a clerk in the post office. Chen Yuanjun and his wife had twelve children, with Chen Jingrun being the third. The family were poor but the children were looked after as well as the parents could in difficult circumstances. When Chen Jingrun was four years old, in July\n1937\n, the Second Chino-Japanese War broke out. Fujian province was a particularly bad place to be at this time since the Island of Taiwan was already controlled by Japan and the Japanese army invaded by crossing the Strait of Taiwan into Fujian province. Many fled to the mountains to avoid the fighting and Chen Jingrun's family went to Sanyuan County in the central part of Shaanxi province where Chen Yuanjun became the director of the post office which had been set up in an old temple.\nFor some time Chen Yuanjun's family were able to live in comparative peace in the mountains but in\n1941\nthe war intensified and Japan began bombing Fujian province. Civilians fled to the mountains as refugees but Japanese troops followed them and took over control of the area where Chen Yuanjun's family were living. During the next few years the family lived in horrific circumstances which only ended in September\n1945\nwhen hostilities came to an end. The family were then able to return to Fuzhou in Fujian province where Chen Jingrun entered Sanyi Middle School. Although the terrors of the war were over, Chen Jingrun's life was still far from easy since he was a fragile child and was bullied at school. Things became far worse in\n1947\nwhen his mother died of tuberculosis.\nIn February\n1948\n, he was admitted to the Fuzhou Yinghua Senior High School, the predecessor of the Middle School affiliated to Fujian Normal University. There he was taught mathematics by Shen Yuan\n(1916\n-\n2004)\nwho became an important influence on his life. Shen Yuan had, like Chen Jingrun, been born in Fuzhou, Fujian province and had studied at Fuzhou Yinghua Senior High School. He studied at the Department of Mechanical Engineering of Tsinghua University but, after the outbreak of the Second Chino-Japanese War in\n1937\ntransferred to Tsinghua University in Kunming where he studied Aeronautical Engineering. He studied for a Ph.D. at the University of London, England and was awarded the degree for his thesis on the compressible flow around a cylinder at high Mach number. Back in China in\n1946\nhe taught mathematics at the Fuzhou Yinghua Senior High School, and taught in the Department of Aeronautical Engineering of Tsinghua University. One day he was teaching the class which Chen Jingrun attended and told them about\nGoldbach\n's Conjecture. He said:-\nMathematics is the queen of the sciences, number theory is the queen's crown, and the\nGoldbach\n's conjecture is the pearl on the crown.\nShen Yuan jokingly said to the class that perhaps one day one of them would solve\nGoldbach\n's Conjecture and all the pupils laughed except Chen Jingrun. Xu Chi reported in\n[\n20\n]\nthat many years later Chen Jingrun said:-\nI did not laugh, I did not dare to laugh. I was worried my classmates would know my vision. But I never forgot this lesson to always remember the pearl on the crown and to never forget my aspirations or ideals.\nChen Jingrun graduated from the Fuzhou Yinghua Senior High School in\n1949\nand later that year entered the Mathematics and Physics Department of Xiamen University. He enjoyed his undergraduate studies and was totally obsessed by mathematics\n[\n18\n]\n:-\nAcquaintances remember Chen appearing on the Xiamen University campus in a black student uniform with a black cap, rubber shoes, carrying a small rattan box and bedroll; his brother, a Xiamen law student, gave Chen his coat to keep warm. Xiamen Professor of Mathematics Ha Fang Zhi related that Chen's study and life in the university was one of poverty \"but\n[\nhe was\n]\nobsessed with school.\"\nIn September\n1953\nChen Jingrun graduated from Xiamen University and became a mathematics teacher in Beijing No.\n4\nMiddle School. It was quickly decided, however, that his teaching was not good enough since the pupils could not understand his accent, and he was told that he could only correct the pupils homework. In February\n1954\nhe was dismissed from the school and he returned to his home town. When Wang Yanan, the president of Xiamen University, learnt what had happened to Chen Jingrun he was surprised given his outstanding undergraduate performance. Realising that Chen Jingrun might not be good at explaining simple mathematics to young children, Wang Yanan invited him to return to Xiamen University in\n1955\nas a librarian.\nWhen the Chinese Civil War ended in\n1949\nwith the mainland becoming the Communist People's Republic of China, many of the anti-Communist Chinese fled to the island of Taiwan and the Kinmen Islands close to Xiamen on mainland China. In late\n1954\nthe People's Republic of China began shelling the Kinmen Islands in an attempt to take control and this continued to\n1955\n. In  Xiamen\n[\n15\n]\n:-\n... air raid alarms were often sounded and the people hid in the air raid shelter. Chen brought several pages of\nHua Loogeng\n's book \"Additive Prime Number Theory\" and studied it even in the shelter. The Chapter\n4\n\"Mean value theorems of certain trigonometric sums II\" in\nHua\n's book discusses the mean value theorems of trigonometric sums of polynomials with lower degrees treated by\nHua\n's method, and Chapter\n5\n\"\nVinogradov\n's mean value theorem and its applications\" is devoted to the mean value theorems of trigonometric sums of polynomials with higher degrees by\nVinogradov\n's method. Chen succeeded in using the method in Chapter\n5\nto improve some results in Chapter\n4\nof\nHua\n's book. He wrote a paper \"On Tarry's problem\" and mailed to\nHua Loogeng\n.\nHua\nwas confident in that Chen has high talent in mathematics after Chen's paper was approved by some mathematicians in the number theory section of the Institute of Mathematics,\nAcademia Sinica\n.\nHua Loogeng\nasked Chen Jingrun to present his results on\nTarry\n's problem to the meeting of the\nChinese Mathematical Society\nin Xiamen University in August\n1956\n. At this meeting\nHua Loogeng\nand Chen Jingrun met in person for the first time and, recognising his remarkable talents,\nHua\nrecommended Chen Jingrun for the position of assistant at the Institute of Mathematics at the\nChinese Academy of Sciences\n. He took up the post in\n1957\nand began a period in which he produced some outstanding number theory results. His first paper\nOn Waring's problem for n-th powers\n(\nChinese\n)\nappeared in\nActa Mathematica Sinica\nin\n1958\n.\nWaring\n's Problem concerns\ng\n(\nk\n)\ng(k)\ng\n(\nk\n)\nand\nG\n(\nk\n)\nG(k)\nG\n(\nk\n)\n. The number\ng\n(\nk\n)\ng(k)\ng\n(\nk\n)\nis the least integer such that every number is the sum of\ng\n(\nk\n)\ng(k)\ng\n(\nk\n)\nor less\nk\nk\nk\n-th powers. The number\nG\n(\nk\n)\nG(k)\nG\n(\nk\n)\nis the least integer such that every integer from a certain point onwards is the sum of\nG\n(\nk\n)\nG(k)\nG\n(\nk\n)\nor less\nk\nk\nk\n-th powers. In the paper by Chen Jingrun quoted above, he shows that\nG\n(\nk\n)\nâ¤\nk\n(\n3\nlog\nâ¡\nk\n+\n5.2\n)\nG(k) â¤ k(3\\log k + 5.2)\nG\n(\nk\n)\nâ¤\nk\n(\n3\nlo\ng\nk\n+\n5\n.\n2\n)\n, improving on\nIvan Matveevich Vinogradov\nresult\nG\n(\nk\n)\nâ¤\nk\n(\n3\nlog\nâ¡\nk\n+\n11\n)\nG(k) â¤ k(3\\log k + 11)\nG\n(\nk\n)\nâ¤\nk\n(\n3\nlo\ng\nk\n+\n1\n1\n)\n. In his next paper\nWaring's problem for g\n(5)\n(1959)\n, he shows that\n37\nâ¤\ng\n(\n5\n)\nâ¤\n40\n37 â¤ g(5) â¤ 40\n3\n7\nâ¤\ng\n(\n5\n)\nâ¤\n4\n0\n, improving on\nL E Dickson\n's result\n37\nâ¤\ng\n(\n5\n)\nâ¤\n54\n37 â¤ g(5) â¤ 54\n3\n7\nâ¤\ng\n(\n5\n)\nâ¤\n5\n4\npublished in\n1933\n. Chen Jingrun finally achieved the result he sought for\ng\n(\n5\n)\ng(5)\ng\n(\n5\n)\nin\n1964\nwhen he proved\ng\n(\n5\n)\n=\n37\ng(5) = 37\ng\n(\n5\n)\n=\n3\n7\n. He had, however, produced a series of paper between\n1959\nand\n1964\nimproving on several number theory results.  These include:\nOn the representation of a natural number as a sum of terms of the form\nÂ\n1\nk\n!\nx\n(\nx\n+\n1\n)\n.\n.\n.\n(\nx\n+\nk\nâ\n1\n)\n\\large\\frac{1}{k!}\\normalsize x(x+1) ... (x+k-1)\nk\n!\n1\nâ\nx\n(\nx\n+\n1\n)\n.\n.\n.\n(\nx\n+\nk\nâ\n1\n)\n(1959)\n;\nThe number of lattice points in a given region\n(1962)\n;\nImprovement of asymptotic formulas for the number of lattice points in a region of three dimensions\n(1963)\n;\nThe lattice-points in a circle\n(1963)\n; and\nOn the divisor problem for\nÂ\nd\n3\n(\nn\n)\nd_{3}(n)\nd\n3\nâ\n(\nn\n)\n.\nFor a list of Chen Jingrun's papers, see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nChen Jingrun's output now became quite remarkable and he had eleven papers published in the two years\n1964\n-\n1965\n. It is even more remarkable when we realise that his main work during these two years was on the\nGoldbach\nconjecture. He made a major breakthrough and proved that a large even integer can be represented as the sum of a prime and the product of at most two primes. He showed the proof to a colleague Min Shie who suggested that, as the result was an important breakthrough in attacking the\nGoldbach\nconjecture, Chen Jingrun should announce the result and then tidy up the proof before publishing the details. An announcement and brief sketch of the proof was published in the paper\nOn the representation of a larger even integer as the sum of a prime and the product of at most two primes\n(1966)\n.\nThe timing proved extremely unfortunate since the announcement of Chen Jingrun's theorem coincided with the Cultural Revolution which was launched by Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party, in May\n1966\nwith the aim of ending any opposition to Communism. Academics were particularly targeted with schools and universities being closed and teachers and professors persecuted. Members of the\nChinese Academy of Sciences\nwere badly affected, and research stopped. Many academics were sent to work in rural farming communities. Chen Jingrun was forced to do manual labour, and lived in a room converted from a boiler room\n[\n18\n]\n:-\nChen was constantly harassed by the newly formed young militant political activist regimen, the \"Red Guards,\" who vigorously sought out pockets of dissent, especially among those they labelled \"intellectuals\" or anyone who held traditional Chinese beliefs. Chen was frequently insulted, spat on, and beaten. The attacks were often so severe that Chen would lose consciousness. Amazingly, even under these horrible conditions, Chen kept working on his mathematical interests. ... As more obvious and expedient targets for the Red Guards emerged, Chen was fortunately left alone and was able to secretly resume his studies, working by kerosene lamp because he was provided no electricity. Chen subsequently became chronically sick; the horrors of his life were having severe physical effects on him ...\nWhile in the Institute in\n1966\nit is thought that Chen Jingrun was beaten and he\n[\n18\n]\n:-\n... may have attempted suicide by jumping out of a third-floor window at the institute, where he landed on a balcony of the second floor and sustained a leg injury.\nConditions for academics greatly improved in\n1971\nafter the First Vice Premier Lin Biao died in a plane crash. He was replaced by Zhou Enlai who was better disposed towards science and academics, and the\nChinese Academy of Sciences\nbegan operating again. Chen Jingrun returned to working on publishing the proof of his major contribution to the\nGoldbach\nConjecture which he had announced in\n1966\n. When it was completed in\n1973\nhe was unsure what to do. One day he met Luo Shengxiong who headed a department at the Mathematical Institute of the\nChinese Academy of Sciences\n. Chen Jingrun told him that he had completed the proof and wanted to publish it but was afraid of being criticised. Luo Shengxiong said that provided the proof was correct, Chen Jingrun should not be afraid. Luo Shengxiong asked a military representative to persuade Chen Jingrun to publish and told him he had nothing to fear. First Vice Premier Zhou Enlai had told the\nChinese Academy of Sciences\nto strengthen research and a meeting of the Academy took place at which the head of the Academy spoke of the importance of Chen Jingrun's theorem. Some members objected to Chen Jingrun's work, saying it was not in line with the aims of the Cultural Revolution. It was also criticised as having no practical significance. Despite opposition, the\nChinese Academy of Sciences\nsupported publication of Chen Jingrun's paper proving that every large even integer can be represented as the sum of a prime and the product of at most two primes. It was published in April\n1973\nwas quickly recognised as a major step forward in attacking the\nGoldbach\nConjecture.\nHeine Halberstam and Hans Egon Richert were in the process of having their book\nSieve Methods\nprinted when they became aware of Chen Jingrun theorem. They added the chapter \"Chen's Theorem\" to their book\nSieve Methods\nbeginning this new chapter as follows:-\nOur object in this chapter will be to prove the following remarkable result of Jin-run Chen, which came to our attention only after Chapters\n1\n-\n10\nhad gone to press; it constitutes a splendid climax to any account of sieve theory.\nAfter reading Chen Jingrun's paper,\nAndrÃ© Weil\nsaid:-\nChen Jingrun's work is like walking on the top of the Himalayas, every step is very difficult.\nThere was still questions about Chen Jingrun's political views, particularly since he tried hard to avoid being involved in politics in any way. He had, however, brought fame to China and it was quickly realised that his health was in a very poor way. Reports on his health were transmitted to Chairman Mao and to Jiang Qing who required that he get immediate medical attention. He received treatment in hospital for a few months, then returned to the Institute of Mathematics at the\nChinese Academy of Sciences\nand went back to working on the\nGoldbach\nConjecture.\nIn\n1976\nthe Cultural Revolution ended following the death of Mao Zedong and the development of science became a major aim. Chen Jingrun received much recognition and fame in China and abroad\n[\n18\n]\n:-\nChen became a \"science hero\" in China, and his work on\nGoldbach\n's conjecture even became a topic of public interest. His images and stories of his life constantly appeared in various newspapers, books, television programs, and even movies. In addition to achieving fame, Chen inspired many students to study science.\nHe received many honours\n[\n3\n]\n:-\nIn January\n1975\n, he was elected as a deputy to the Fourth National People's Congress, and later served as a deputy to the Fifth and Sixth National People's Congress. Exceptionally he was promoted to researcher in\n1977\n. In\n1979\n, heÂ wasÂ invited by the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton to visit and give lectures, and he received extensive praise from the international community.Â In\n1980\n, he was electedÂ asÂ a member of the Department of Physics and Mathematics of the\nChinese Academy of Sciences\n. In March\n1981\n, he was elected as a full member of theÂ\nChinese Academy of Sciences\n. In\n1988\n, he was designated as a first-class researcher. In\n1992\n, he served as the editor-in-chief of \"Acta Mathematica\" and won the first\nHua Loo-Keng\nÂ Mathematics Award.\nThe International Congress of Mathematicians was to be held in Helsinki, Finland, in August\n1978\n. The scientific programme was the responsibility of the International Mathematical Union through their Consultative Committee, whose chairman was\nArmand Borel\n. The Consultative Committee took advice from panels of the various sections on who should be invited and the Number Theory Section panel recommended Chen Jingrun be invited. He was invited by the International Mathematical Union to give a\n45\n-minute talk and, after receiving the invitation gave it serious consideration. He did not accept, however, sending the following reply to the International Mathematical Union:-\nFirst, my country has always attached great importance to the development of academic exchanges and friendly relations with scientists from all over the world. Therefore, I would like to thank the President of the International Mathematical Union. Second, there is only one China in the world, the People's Republic of China, Taiwan is an inalienable province of China, and Taiwan currently occupies the seat of our country in the International Mathematical Union, therefore, I cannot participate. Third, if the Taiwan representative is expelled, I can consider attending.\nAt the\n1978\nCongress, Henryk Iwaniec, a Polish mathematician at the Institute of Mathematics of the\nPolish Academy of Sciences\n, addressed the Number Theory Section with his talk\nSieve Methods\n. He said:-\nRecently Chen\n[\nOn the representation of a larger even integer as the sum of a prime and the product of at most two primes\n(1973)]\ncaused a sensation by his proof of the following result, the last but one approximation to the solution of the Goldbach problem:\nTHEOREM\n1\n. Every sufficiently large even number N is a sum of a prime and the product of at most two primes.\n...\nIn the speaker's opinion, a real revolution in the sieve theory has been initiated by another achievement of Chen\n[\nOn the distribution of almost primes in an interval\n(1975)]\n:\nTHEOREM\n2\n. If x is sufficiently large then there must be the product of at most two primes in the interval\n(\nx, x + âx\n)\n.\nAs we have seen, Chen Jingrun's health was poor even before he was hospitalised in\n1973\n. Certainly despite the steady stream of outstanding research he produced, he struggled with illness. In November\n1977\nhis admission to the No.\n309\nLiberation Army Hospital was arranged by Vice Premier Deng Xiaoping\n[\n6\n]\n:-\nThe news that the great mathematician Chen Jingrun was recuperating in the\n309\nhospital quickly spread, causing a sensation in the whole hospital. To be honest, everyone really wanted to see this genius mathematician, but they were too embarrassed to disturb him, so they always hid at the door. Looking around quietly, Chen Jingrun didn't say anything, but smiled at everyone.\nYou Kun was a\n22\n-year old doctor studying at the hospital, and after she had met Chen Jingrun and they had got on well together, she was assigned to Chen Jingrun's ward as the doctor on duty. They became close friends and after Chen Jingrun left the hospital the two continued to communicate. Eventually Chen Jingrun, who had previously found talking to women difficult, asked her to marry him. They were married in Beijing on\n25\nAugust\n1980\nand their only child, a son Chen Youwei, was born in\n1981\n.\nIn April\n1984\nChen Jingrun, who was working at the Mathematical Institute of the\nChinese Academy of Sciences\nin Beijing, cycled from his home to the Xinhua Bookshop. He was hit by a fast moving cyclist, was knocked unconscious, and was taken to hospital. When treating him for head injuries, the doctors realised that he had problems which were not a consequence of the accident and he was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. A few months later, when getting off a bus, he was pushed by a crowd and again fell causing concussion. Although he made some slow progress, he was hospitalised for a long time and received many treatments, both Western and traditional Chinese. He returned to mathematics although his mental powers were seriously affected by his illness. All his papers after\n1986\nwere joint ones and, because of Parkinson's disease, he probably was unable to make much of a contribution to them, although his students greatly appreciated working with such a famous mathematician. He died of pneumonia at the age of\n63\nyears.\nFollowing his death in\n1996\n, his achievements continued to be honoured. In\n1999\nChina issued a commemorative\n80\n-yuan stamp \"The Best Result of\nGoldbach\nConjecture\" with a silhouette ofÂ Chen Jingrun. On\n19\nSeptember\n2020\nChina issued a \"Chen Jingrun, Mathematician\"\n1\n.\n20\nrenminbi yuan stamp with his portrait. See\nTHIS LINK\n.\nThe Minor Planet Center, part of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, named asteroid\n7681\nChenjingrun after him. In\n2006\n, Xiamen University erected a seated bronze statue of Chen Jingrun near its School of Mathematical Sciences. The\nChinese Academy of Sciences\npresents the Chen Jingrun Award for Young Talents.",
