  "biografia": "Adolphe Rome\nwas the son of EugÃ¨ne Rome\n(1860\n-\n1938)\nand Marie Pauly\n(1854\n-\n1937)\n. Marie Pauly's father had been a cabinetmaker and president of the Saint-Joseph Guild. He was also a musician who played the organ of the church of Saint-SÃ©bastien for\n35\nyears. When Adolphe was born, his father EugÃ¨ne Rome was a professor at the Saint-Remacle Institute in Stavelot. EugÃ¨ne, however, was awarded a doctorate in classical philology and was appointed as a professor at the Royal Athenaeum of Mechelen, where he taught for a long time Latin, Greek, French and Rhetoric. The Rome family was financially wealthy and very talented academically; they were devout Roman Catholics. There were five children in the family, three boys and two girls. Adolphe was the oldest of the three boys having younger brothers Remacle Rome\n(1893\n-\n1974)\nand Paul Rome\n(1896\n-\n1989)\n. Remacle became a monk at Maredsous Abbey, a Benedictine monastery near Namur in Belgium and professor of palaeontology at the University of Louvain.\n[\nLet us note here that Louvain is the French name and Leuven the Dutch for the same city; we shall use Louvain since most of references are in French.\n]\nPaul became an architect designing churches, abbeys, homes and other buildings. Of Adolphe's two sisters, Marie-Benoit Rome and Marie-JosÃ© Rome, the first became a Benedictine nun and the second studied medicine and became a doctor\n(\nextremely unusual for a girl at the beginning of the\n20\nth century\n)\n.\nAs a child, Adolphe was taught by his father but for his secondary education he studied at the Royal Athenaeum of Mechelen where his father was a professor. In July\n1906\nhe showed his outstanding academic abilities when he was ranked first in the Concours gÃ©nÃ©ral between all the Belgium Athenaeums. He was also ranked as the top student in mathematics at the Royal Athenaeum of Mechelen. Having a religious vacation, rather than continue to study mathematics at a university, he opted to enter the Seminary of Mechelen to receive theological training. His outstanding abilities, however, led the Seminary to send him to study at the Catholic University of Louvain. Rome confided in Franz de Ruyt later in life\n[\n3\n]\n:-\nAt that time, the diocese used to send the top student in the class to study theology, the second to study classical philology, while the third could do mathematics. Alas! I was the second!\nAlthough he would have wished to study mathematics, nevertheless he put much effort into his studies of classical philology, which was, of course, the subject his father had studied. At the Catholic University of Louvain he studied under Edmond Remy\n(1860\n-\n1939)\nthe professor of Latin philology. He was nearing the completion of his studies in\n1914\nwhen World War I broke out.\nOn\n25\nAugust\n1914\n, German troops entered Louvain and over the following five days burnt and looted much of the town, killing hundreds of the local population. Rome had joined the Red Cross and fled with many Belgium refugees making their way to England. He ended up in Somerset and became chaplain to the refugees. He joined the Belgian army in England on\n28\nAugust\n1916\n, and after training was sent to teach at St Mary's College in London in\n1917\n. While there he continued working on his doctorate and, after the war ended in\n1918\n, he was able to return to the University of Louvain where he defended his Classical Philology Ph.D. thesis on\n1\nSeptember\n1919\nin the ruined city. Rome may have been forced into Classical Philology rather than mathematics, but when we see the title of his thesis,\nLes Fonctions Trigonometriques dans Heron d'Alexandrie\nâ\n(\nTrigonometric functions in Heron of Alexandria\n)\n, we see that he had managed to satisfy his passion for mathematics by his choice of Classical Philology topic. He also gained distinction for his public lecture, which was part of the Ph.D. examination, on the\nFirst Oration of Cicero\n.\nIn\n1919\nhe began teaching at the Institut Sainte-Marie in Schaerbeek, a Catholic nursery and primary school. He then moved to the Sainte-Gertrude Institute in Nivelle, a secondary school founded in\n1915\n, where he taught until\n1922\n. During the years\n1919\n-\n1922\n, Rome continued to undertake research having a particular interest in ancient Greek manuscripts. For instance, in August\n1921\nduring the school holidays he went to London where he spent much time at the British Museum reading Greek manuscripts. He was preparing to compete for a Government Travel Scholarship since his aim was to have a research career rather than to remain a school teacher. His years as a teacher had not been a great success since the young pupils found his teaching difficult to understand.\nOn\n26\nMay\n1922\nit was announced that Rome was the winner of a Government Travel Scholarship and his research career began in earnest. He went to the Belgian Historical Institute in Rome which was his main place of work over the next two years, although he travelled extensively. The Belgian Historical Institute in Rome had been set up in\n1902\nas a research institute focussing on Italian history and antiquities. The director of the Institute was Ursmer BerliÃ¨re\n(1861\n-\n1932)\na monastic historian who published over\n350\narticles. The secretary of the Institute was Maurice Vaes\n(1875\n-\n1962)\nwho held this position for over\n30\nyears beginning in\n1922\n. While based at the Institute, Rome made many trips to libraries to study manuscripts of the mathematicians of ancient Alexandria. He visited various libraries in Italy, went back to London again, and then went to Athens, followed by trips to Malta and Syracuse. Finally he visited Paris where the National Library of Paris retained him from\n1924\nto\n1927\n. During this time he was chaplain to the Benedictine Ladies of St Louis du Temple, rue Monsieur. This monastery had been founded in\n1802\nbut the nuns were evicted in\n1848\nand at the time Rome was their chaplain they were based at rue Monsieur in Paris.\nDuring the years to\n1927\nRome published a number of papers:\nSur le problÃ¨me de la distance de deux villes: dans le Dioptre de HÃ©ron\nâ\n(\nOn the problem of the distance of two cities: in Heron's 'Dioptre'\n)\n(1923)\n;\n\"Le troisiÃ¨me livre des commentaires sur l'Almageste\" par Theon et Hypatie\nâ\n(\n'The third book of commentaries on the Almageste' by Theon and Hypatia\n)\nÂ\n(1926)\n;\nL'Astrolabe et le MÃ©tÃ©oroscope d'aprÃ¨s le commentaire de Pappus sur le\n5\ne livre de l'Almageste\nâ\n(\nThe Astrolabe and the meteoroscope from Pappus's commentary on the\n5\nth book of the Almagest\n)\n(1927)\n;\nL'instrument parallactique d'aprÃ¨s le commentaire de Pappus sur le\n5\ne livre de l'Almageste\nâ\n(\nThe parallactic instrument according to the commentary by Pappus on the\n5\nth book of Almagest\n)\n(1927)\n; and\nL'Instrument Parallactique d'aprÃ¨s le commentaire de Pappus sur le\n5\ne livre de l'Almageste\nâ\n(\nThe parallactic instrument according to the commentary by Pappus on the\n5\nth book of Almagest\n)\n(1927)\n. Although the two last quoted titles are the same, one is published by the Vatican Library and the other by Laboratoire d'Astronomie et de Geodesie de l'Universite de Louvain\nâ\n(\nLaboratory of Astronomy and Geodesy of the University of Louvain\n)\n.\nFranÃ§ois Collard\n(1852\n-\n1927)\nwas professor of classical philology and methodology, and the president of the pedagogical circle of professors from the University of Louvain. He died on\n14\nOctober\n1927\nafter a short illness and the University of Louvain appointed Rome as his successor, first as a lecturer and then from\n1929\nas professor. He became Honorary Canon of the Metropolitan Chapter of Mechelen in\n1935\n. Franz de Ruyt was a student of his at Louvain and he gives this description of Rome as a teacher in\n[\n3\n]\n:-\nI attended his first class: he astonished us by the simplicity of his presentation, marked, however, by a clever critical sense, his slender, somewhat quaint voice, his tiny writing, and his stiff, timid gestures; but he also charmed us with the originality of his comparisons, his authentic belief in the complexity of the interpretations, of which he managed the complexity by seeking the most natural explanation. He conscientiously prepared his classes daily, by renewing their subject every year and questioning it indefatigably. He devoted his evenings there until midnight, and then took care of his personal work late at night, because in the afternoon he spent a long time seeing the students, of whom he directed the dissertations of their license or doctorate. He devoted himself to his numerous pupils without counting the cost, whatever direction they chose, because he respected the wishes of each one. He did much literary work, but his predilection obviously went to those who were interested in the history of science and many such theses were undertaken on his advice. He trained several disciples in this field and one of them, Father Joseph Mogenet, succeeded him brilliantly and managed to make official a course and a seminary of the History of the Sciences of Antiquity.\nAnne Tihon, in\n[\n5\n]\n, describes Mogenet's life and work. After World War II ended Mogenet:-\n... resumed his teaching and studies under Canon Rome, obtaining his doctorate in classical philology in\n1947\nwith an unpublished work on Theodosius of Tripoli. In\n1950\nhe wrote as his thesis for admission to a senior teaching post a masterly work on Autolycus of Pitane. In it he presented not only a critical edition of the oldest known Greek mathematics treatise, but also a new method of classifying manuscripts, since applied successfully in several theses.\nRome's publications were numerous despite high teaching loads which he carried out very conscientiously. His research interests were mainly in the history of ancient Greek mathematics and astronomy, particularly the work of\nArchimedes\n,\nPtolemy\n,\nHeron\nand especially\nPappus\nand\nTheon\nof Alexandria. He produced a modern annotated edition of the commentaries on the\nAlmagest\nâ\n(\nThe major thesis: from the Arabic 'al-majisti' -- the Arabic translation of the Greek 'Mathematike Syntaxis' later translated into Latin as 'Magna Syntaxis'\n)\nby\nPappus\nand\nTheon\nof Alexandria, but the jewel of this was his find of a manuscript in Florence of the third book of\nTheon\nand the sixth book of Pappus which had been thought to be lost. He published this as:\nCommentaires de Pappus et de ThÃ©on d'Alexandrie sur l'Almageste : tome I : Pappus d'Alexandrie : commentaire sur les livres\n5\net\n6\nde l'Almageste\nâ\n(\nCommentaries of Pappus and ThÃ©on of Alexandria on the Almagest: volume I\n)\n(1931)\n;\nCommentaires de Pappus et de ThÃ©on d'Alexandrie sur l'Almageste : tome II : ThÃ©on d'Alexandrie : commentaire sur les livres\n1\net\n2\nde l'Almageste\nâ\n(\nCommentaries of Pappus and ThÃ©on  of Alexandria on Almagest: volume II\n)\n(1936)\n; and\nCommentaires de Pappus et de ThÃ©on d'Alexandrie sur l'Almageste : tome III : ThÃ©on d'Alexandrie : commentaire sur les livres\n3\net\n4\nde l'Almageste\nâ\n(\nCommentaries of Pappus and ThÃ©on  of Alexandria on Almagest: volume III\n)\n(1943)\n.\nOne of Rome's aims with this work was to determine whether\nHypatia\nhad written the commentary on the\nAlmagest\nâ\n(\nThe major thesis: from the Arabic 'al-majisti' -- the Arabic translation of the Greek 'Mathematike Syntaxis' later translated into Latin as 'Magna Syntaxis'\n)\n. His methods were to compare the Greek Attic dialect with the Hellenistic Alexandrian dialect. He devised a statistical approach to studying difference with style, grammar and the frequency of use of certain words to compare\nTheon\n's writing with\nHypatia\n's writing. Unfortunately he did not find the statistical significance required to prove one way or the other whether\nHypatia\nwrote\nCommentary on the Almagest\n. In addition to this research and his teaching commitments, Rome, along with Franz Cumont and Joseph Bidez, founded the journal\nL'Antique Classique\nin\n1932\n.\nNot all his publications were on ancient mathematics, however, for he also wrote articles on Pindar, Aeschylus, Euripides and Theocritus.\nThe Library of the Catholic University of Louvain was established in\n1835\nbut destroyed by the Germans in\n1914\nat the beginning of World War I. A new library was built between\n1921\nand\n1928\nwith donations coming from around the world. Rome lived on the Avenue des AlliÃ©s, near the railway station. When World War II broke out in\n1939\n, he decided that to keep his many priceless documents safe he would take them to be stored in the university library. They were not safe, however, for in May\n1940\nthe Germans attacked Louvain and the library was hit by an incendiary bomb destroying much of its contents including Rome's precious manuscripts. Franz de Ruyt writes\n[\n3\n]\n:-\nI was mobilised at that moment, but as soon as I returned home, after the forced surrender of our army, I learned of the disaster. On my first visit to Canon Rome, I did not know how to express my sorrow for what had happened to him. I found him at his desk, where a small bundle of cards was already piling up. \"You have learned,\" he said to me, interrupting me with a gesture, and, showing the cards, he added simply, \"See, I am doing it again,\" and then inquired with good-humour about myself. I will never forget the impression this stoic energy gave me, without a complaint, refusing even commiseration. On that day, I, who did not know how to hide my tears, understood what greatness of soul was.\nRome had other problems as a result of the Nazi control of Belgium\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nIn addition to the Nazi destruction of Rome's work onÂ the 'Commentary on the Almagest',Â his journalÂ 'L'Antique Classique'Â began to fall under Nazi scrutiny. Rome, aware of a potentially destructive outcome, carefully made efforts to preserve the journal on a material level. While under the Nazi's surveillance, he covertly converted the journal's reserves to paper stock\n(\nthat was hidden\n)\n. By doing this, the stocks avoided specific requirements that the Nazi regime had enforced. The journal survived and was still in tangible form. At the height of World War II in\n1943\n, the jornal was suspended. However, the war did not stop Rome and his team who were able to take all of the copies that eluded alteration, which was still in the previously hidden stock, and ship them out of the country without any government censorship.\nThe\n1950\nInternational Congress of Mathematicians was held in Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA from\n30\nAugust to\n6\nSeptember. Rome was one of the invited plenary speakers. He sailed from Le Havre to New York on the ship\nMauretania\n, arriving in New York on\n17\nAugust\n1950\n. He delivered his address at\n9\na.m. on Friday\n1\nSeptember in the Fogg Large Room. The title of his address was\nThe calculation of an eclipse of the sun according to Theon of Alexandria\n.\nYou can read an extract from Rome's ICM lecture at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nAfter attending the Congress, Rome sailed from New York to Cherbourg on the ship\nQueen Mary\n, leaving New York on\n14\nSeptember.\nRome had two main hobbies, one being an interest in plants which he loved to investigate during long walks of\n30\nto\n50\nkm on foot through the countryside around Leuven and up to the Meuse. His other hobby, although in many ways it was used for the benefit of others, was his love of music and in particular his organ playing. While at the Mechelen seminary he played the organ in Saint-Rombaut Cathedral, and while when in Louvain he played the organ at the Church of Notre-Dame MÃ©diatrice.\nIn\n[\n3\n]\nFranz de Ruyt describes the honours Rome received and how he lived:-\nOn\n3\nMay\n1948\n, our Class of Letters and Moral and Political Sciences had elected him a corresponding member of the\nRoyal Belgium Academy of Sciences, Letters and Fine Arts\n, of which he became a full member on\n11\nDecember\n1950\n. On\n19\nDecember\n1956\n, he was proclaimed Dean of Honour of Labour, for scientific work and promoted, in\n1959\n, to Grand Officer of the Order of Leopold.\nThese high distinctions did not alter the simplicity of his behaviour, although he was justifiably proud of them. The asceticism and the stripping of his life were not changed. His minimal furniture kept disappearing under stacks of books and bundles of cards wrapped in brown paper, from which he undid the strings as he began his classes. Empty sugar boxes served as chair rails and the heating was practically nil. The frugality of his meals, his refusal of alcoholic drink and tobacco supplemented this radical abstinence. But his charity distributed more than the value of all these extras to his students, his works or other necessities.\nWhen he was still teaching in\n1958\nhe had a sudden illness which took away his mobility and the sight of one eye. He retired and was made professor emeritus at Louvain in\n1959\n. Despite his disabilities he continued to attend meetings of the\nAcademy\nalthough half paralysed. Franz de Ruyt writes\n[\n3\n]\n:-\nHe continued for a long time to live alone, in spite of everything. It was necessary for an ambulance to pick him up in the street to consent to be treated in the admirable retirement home \"Emmaus\" at Korbeek-Lo. I saw him sitting in an armchair, surrounded by books and index cards, but with his full lucidity, when he could hardly move, and we talked about the\nAcademy\n.\nPerhaps it was rather fitting that this devout Christian should die on Good Friday,\n9\nApril\n1971\n.",
