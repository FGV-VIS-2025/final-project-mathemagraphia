  "biografia": "Dorothy Wrinch\n's parents were Ada Minnie Souter\n(1867\n-\n1933)\nand Hugh Edward Hart Wrinch\n(1866\n-\n1934)\n, who was an engineer. Although Dorothy was born in Argentina, Ada and Hugh were British and they returned to Surbiton, which is\n19\nkm southwest of central London, where Dorothy was brought up. Let us give some details of Dorothy's parents to understand how she came to be born in Argentina.\nHugh Wrinch was born in Woodbridge, Suffolk, attended Woodbridge Grammar School, then worked for the firm of Whitmore & Binyon who made steam engines and mills of all different types. He showed considerable abilities and in\n1890\nhe decided to go abroad to take a leading position in an engineering firm. There was much British investment in railways and water works in Argentina so he decided to go there. He was soon the pumping manager in the Consolidated Water Works Company in Rosario, Argentina. When he went to Argentina in\n1890\nhe had a fiancÃ©, Ada Minnie Souter, who had been born in Harleston, Norfolk. Ada's father was a station master for the Great Eastern Railway, and the family lived in a number of different towns as she was growing up. She became a school teacher and then headmistress before deciding to travel alone to Argentina to meet up with Hugh; she arrived in September\n1893\n. They were married in St Bartholomew's Anglican Church in Rosario on\n11\nNovember\n1893\nand their first child, Dorothy Wrinch, the subject of this biography, was born in the following year.\nRosario benefitted greatly from Hugh Wrinch's work in heading a project to provide running water to the houses of the town. The Consolidated Water Works Company showed their appreciation for his excellent work but, for health reasons which are rather unclear, he decided to return to England in\n1897\n. He quickly got a job with the Chelsea Waterworks Company and the family lived at\n1\nMilford Place, Maple Road, Surbiton. On\n14\nJuly\n1899\nDorothy's sister, Muriel Louise Wrinch, was born.\nDorothy Wrinch began her education at Surbiton High School in January\n1899\n. The school was run by Alice Procter assisted by her sister ZoÃ« Procter. Wrinch gained certificates in History, English, Mechanics, French, Latin, Mathematics\n(\nelementary\n)\nand Mathematics\n(\nadvanced\n)\n. She wanted to learn more mathematics than the school could provide, so she attended mathematics courses at the University of London. She won a scholarship to attend Girton College, Cambridge University, and was accepted for entry in\n1912\n. She decided, however, to defer entry for a year and matriculated at Girton in\n1913\n. There she studied mathematics and philosophy, in particular studying the Mathematical Tripos. In her first year she joined the Musical Society, the Mathematical Club, and the Society for the Study of Little-Known Literature. She also played tennis for the Girton College team. She took the examinations for Part I of the Mathematical Tripos in\n1914\nafter one year at Cambridge. Many students took two years before taking these examinations and Wrinch might have been better to have followed that route. She was graded Second Class in the examinations, something which greatly disappointed her. She determined to do better in Part II, and was now advised by\nNeville Watson\n.\nShe was much influenced by\nBertrand Russell\n's work and she studied this on her own, sometimes corresponding with\nRussell\nwho had been appointed as a lecturer at Cambridge three years before Wrinch began to study there. Also at Cambridge she attended lectures by\nWilliam Ernest Johnson\non logic. She took Part II of the Mathematical Tripos and graduated in\n1916\nas a\nWrangler\n, meaning that she had achieved a First Class degree\n[\n22\n]\n:-\nDot Wrinch was Girton's only Wrangler in\n1916\n. The 'Manchester Guardian' published the names of all the Wranglers, hers included, but biographies only of the men.\nRussell\n's ideas on mathematical logic were a major influence on Wrinch and she also strongly supported his anti-war beliefs. In June\n1916\nWrinch met\nRussell\nfor the first time. She was looking for a scholarship to allow her to undertake research on mathematical logic.\nRussell\nagreed to advise her, she arranged a part-time job to support herself and Girton College awarded her a scholarship to study the Moral Sciences Tripos. These plans, however, all fell apart almost immediately since\nRussell\n's lectureship was cancelled because of his anti-war stance. All was not lost since he invited Wrinch and three other students to study privately with him in London. After a while\nG H Hardy\nagreed to become Wrinch's official research supervisor, although\nRussell\nwould continue to unofficially advise her, and\nHardy\npersuaded Girton College to award Wrinch a stipend to cover her expenses for a year of research. In\n1917\nshe published three papers:\nMr Russell's Lowell Lectures\nin\nMind\n,\nBernard Bolzano\n(1781\n-\n1848)\nin\nThe Monist\n, and\nOn the summation of pleasures\nin the\nProceedings\nof the Aristotelian Society.\nFor more information on these papers and other papers published by Wrinch between\n1917\nand\n1927\n, see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nIn\n1917\nWrinch also wrote the essay\nTransfinite types\nwhich was considered for Girton College's Gamble Prize.\nRussell\nwrote to Girton in March\n1918\n:-\nMiss Wrinch's notes consist in the main of an interesting development of certain ideas suggested by\nHausdorff\n. They deal with the investigation of series constructed by the 'principle of first differences.' There are a number of new results, and the method employed is obviously a fruitful one, giving possibilities of very important theorems. it points the way to a whole field of new research.\nTwo months after writing this recommendation,\nRussell\nwas in Brixton prison beginning a six-month sentence for an anti-war leaflet he had written. Wrinch was awarded the Gamble Prize. She remained at Cambridge undertaking research in mathematics until\n1918\nwhen she moved to University College in London. She lectured in mathematics at University College while working for her M.Sc. and then D.Sc. in mathematics advised by John Nicholson\n(1881\n-\n1955)\n. The master's degree was awarded in\n1920\n, the year in which she returned to Girton to take up the Yarrow Research Fellowship in mathematics; this funded her for the next four years. She was awarded her D.Sc. by University College while undertaking research at Girton.\nDuring this time, as well as undertaking research for her doctorate, Wrinch was working closely with\nHarold Jeffreys\n. They\n[\n22\n]\n:-\n... were constant companions, writing papers together, singing in the Philharmonic Chorus, and planning - with a small group of Cambridge scientists - the post-war organisation that became the National Union of Scientific Workers.\n[\nWrinch's\n]\nname appears next to Harold's in a guest list for a reception for\nEinstein\n. Harold grew close to the Wrinch family; his photographs are the only ones we have of them in those years. Not surprisingly, some observers thought they were engaged.\nThree joint papers they wrote on probability over these years were\nOn Some Aspects of the Theory of Probability\n(1919)\n,\nOn Certain Fundamental Principles of Scientific Inquiry\n(1921)\nand\nOn Certain Fundamental Principles of Scientific Inquiry\n(1923)\n. In their views of probability they were influenced by\nWilliam Ernest Johnson\n, whose lectures Wrinch had attended, and\nJohn Maynard Keynes\n. For more information about these papers, see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nJeffreys\ncontinued to work on these topics and always acknowledged that it was built on his joint work with Wrinch. For example, you can see the Preface to\nJeffreys\n' book\nScientific Inference\n(1931)\nat\nTHIS LINK\n.\nAlso while working for her doctorate, in\n1921\nWrinch joined the British Committee on Mathematical Tables. Some of the work she carried out for the Committee was done in collaboration with her father Hugh E H Wrinch. Some papers in this areas are:\n(\nwith Hugh E H Wrinch\n)\n,\nTables of the Bessel function\nI\nn\n(\nx\n)\nI_{n}(x)\nI\nn\nâ\n(\nx\n)\n(1923)\n,\nSome approximations to hypergeometric functions\n(1923)\n,\n(\nwith Hugh E H Wrinch\n)\n,\nTables of Bessel functions\n(1924)\n,\n(\nwith Hugh E H Wrinch\n)\n,\nThe roots of hypergeometric functions with a numerator and four denominators\n(1926)\n.\nOn\n1\nAugust\n1922\nshe married John William Nicholson in St Mark's Church, Surbiton. John Nicholson was the director of mathematics and physics at Balliol College, Oxford and had been her thesis advisor; they had one child, a daughter Pamela born on\n20\nMarch\n1927\nin Oxford. After her marriage Wrinch moved to Oxford where she taught mathematics at different women's colleges. In\n1927\nshe was appointed as a lecturer at Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford. Despite already having an M.Sc. and a D.Sc. from London, she worked at Oxford for these degrees again, and was awarded her second M.Sc. in\n1924\nand her second D.Sc. in\n1929\n. This was the first Oxford award of a D.Sc. to a woman.\nA measure of her research activity during this period is that from\n1918\nto\n1932\nWrinch published twenty papers on pure and applied mathematics, and sixteen papers on scientific methodology and the philosophy of science. In addition she published a large number of reviews of books and also eight papers giving overviews of ongoing work in pure mathematics, applied mathematics and logic. Sadly Wrinch's marriage became a difficult one as her husband turned increasingly towards alcohol. By\n1930\nthings reached such a state that Wrinch and her husband separated and she brought up their child Pamela. In the same year she published the book\nThe Retreat from Parenthood\nwhich appeared under the pseudonym \"Jean Ayling.\" She writes in the Preface:-\nIn the earlier pages of this book, the author has permitted herself the liberty of making anÂ exposÃ©Â of certain typical \"happy\" homes of England. These private places, though an unexpectedly rich mine of information with regard to present-day ideas and tendencies, and an undoubtedly intriguing subject to the anthropologists of to-day and the historian of to-morrow, were not the prime objective. They presented themselves for investigation in answer to a question which faces the student of current events: Why is it that, during the last twenty or thirty years, doctors and lawyers, scientists and civil servants, engineers and educationalists, artists and architects, and all the rest of the men and women who earn their living in professional fields, have so severely curtailed their fertility?\nIn the book, she argued for a Child Rearing Service and wrote that:-\n... children's interests are seriously damaged by the fact that so many women are presented with the choice between career and cradle; and that the insistence on a sterility qualification for women who undertake professional work is as prejudicial as the insistence on whole-time motherhood for those that breed.\nBetween\n1931\nand\n1934\nshe was awarded a number of fellowships which enabled her to broaden her scientific knowledge by studying physics, chemistry and biology at a number of the leading European universities. In particular she spent time at the universities in Vienna, Paris, Prague and Leiden.\nD'Arcy Thompson\nhad encouraged her to apply her mathematical skills to biology and\n[\n5\n]\n:-\nWrinchÂ became a founding member of theÂ Biotheoretical Gathering. Among the particular interests of this group of Cambridge biochemists and crystallographers was the structure of proteins and chromosomes; the possibility of linear sequences of amino acids or nucleic acids being involved in the genetic process was already being considered.\nShe began to publish papers on the application of mathematical techniques to biology. In particular she wrote five papers on chromosomes between\n1934\nand\n1936\nto which she applied potential theory. These are:\nChromosome behavior in terms of protein pattern\n(1934)\n,\nThe contractile factors of the chromosome micelle\n(1935)\n,\nThe chromosome micelle and the banded structure of chromosomes in the salivary gland\n(1935)\n,\nChromosomes and molecular aggregates\n(1935)\n, and\nOn the molecular structure of chromosomes\n(1936)\n. The fourth of these papers begins with a review of the earlier papers:-\nIn a recent communication\n(\nNature,\n134\n,\n978\n,\n1934)\nthe present writer has put forward a molecular model of a chromosome, based upon the present state of knowledge in protein and physical chemistry, which provides a simple and obvious explanation and interpretation of the banded structure of the giant chromosomes belonging to the salivary glands of Drosophila, Chironomus, Sciara ... which has been the subject of a large number of recent researches in Europe and America.\nIn this model, homologous protamine molecules lie helically along a quasi-cylindrical surface, and the chromosome is specified in terms of the side chains belonging to the peptide linked amino acid residues which constitute these molecules. The hypothesis is in fact that the genetic nature of a chromosome resides in a characteristic arrangement of amino acid residues of various types. There is a consensus of opinion that the amino acids which occur in protamines are for the most pact highly basic. Given the arrangement of the residues, the arrangement of the molecules of nucleic acid is largely determined. Where there are arginine or other basic residues, there will also be molecules of nucleic acid, but where there are non-basic residues nucleic acid molecules will be absent. Thus the model implies the existence of rings of nucleic molecules at various positions along the length of the chromosome micelle.\nI would therefore interpret the \"dark bands\" on the chromosomes of the salivary gland as regions of high nucleic acid density. The salivary chromosome is. of course, a compound structure consisting of homologous chromosomes lying side by side. Dark bands simply indicate regions of the constituent chromosomes where there is a high density of basic amino acid residues.\nThis remarkable work led to Wrinch being awarded a Rockefeller Foundation fellowship to support her study of the application of mathematics to biological molecular structures. This fellowship allowed her to undertake a lecturing tour of universities in the United States where she put forward her theories, including a controversial idea of cyclol protein structure. This theory was based on ideas of mathematical symmetry. Although it was later shown to be incorrect for proteins, her theories were found to apply to chemical bonds which occur in some alkaloids. Wrinch's\n[\n12\n]\n:-\n... theory hinged on the existence of cyclol bonds between theÂ amino acidsÂ that make up proteins. Although the theory was attractive for the mathematical symmetry that it possessed and its ability to explain many properties of proteins, it came under attack almost immediately by BritishÂ X-rayÂ crystallographers, who asserted that the theory did not conform to their experimental data. In addition, American chemistÂ Linus PaulingÂ calculated that cyclol bonds were too unstable to persist for any length of time. Pauling and Wrinch engaged in an increasinglyÂ acrimoniousÂ debate through the pages of theÂ Journal of the American Chemical Society. Eventually, both were proved wrong: cyclol bonds were found to exist inÂ ergotÂ\n(\naÂ fungal diseaseÂ of cereal grasses\n)\n, and amino acids were found to combine inÂ DNAÂ chains. Wrinch blamed Pauling for her difficulty in finding an academic position in the United States after immigrating there in\n1939\n.\nBy\n1939\nthe world was moving towards war and Wrinch offered to work for the British war effort. Her offer, however, was rejected and this led to her deciding to emigrate to the United States where she was appointed as a visiting lecturer in chemistry at Johns Hopkins University.\nBy the time that Wrinch had emigrated to the United States her marriage had been dissolved\n(\nthis happened in\n1938)\n. While she was a visiting lecturer at Johns Hopkins she met Otto Charles Glaser\n(1880\n-\n1951)\n, a biologist who was vice president of Amherst College for men in Amhurst, Massachusetts. In\n1941\nshe was appointed visiting professor at Amherst College and also at Smith College for women in Northampton, Massachusetts, and Mount Hoylake College for women in South Hadley Massachusetts. On\n20\nAugust of the same year she married Glaser. Two years later, in\n1943\n, she was appointed as research professor of physics at Smith College where, in\n1965\n, she was awarded a Sophia Smith Fellowship. The Fellowship was named after Sophia Smith who was an heiress who left her fortune to establish Smith College, which was founded in\n1871\nand opened in\n1875\n. Wrinch held the Fellowship until she retired in\n1971\nwhen she went to Woods Hole, Massachusetts.\nAfter emigrating to the United States, Wrinch focused on the application of mathematical principles to the interpretation of X-ray crystallographic data of complex crystal structures. This work was set out in detail in her text\nFourier Transforms and Structure Factors\nwhich was published in\n1946\n. An interesting episode is related in\n[\n27\n]\n.\nVon Neumann\nwrote in a letter to\nNorbert Wiener\n, which is discussed in\n[\n27\n]\n, that he would consult with Irving Langmuir and Wrinch regarding the possibility of using electronic computers to determine protein structure via X-ray crystallographic analysis. A meeting between\nvon Neumann\n, Langmuir, Wrinch and A D Booth did indeed take place in Schenectady on Wednesday\n16\nApril\n1947\n. After discussions they decided\n(\ncorrectly it turned out\n)\nthat computers would not give an immediate solution because of the difficult problem of determining phases.\nMary Creese paints a picture of Wrinch's last years\n[\n5\n]\n:-\nA controversial figure in early research in molecular biology, bright, ambitious, hardworking, and adventurous,Â Dorothy WrinchÂ was for much of her life a restless outsider, something of an exile in her American environment, who took up difficult problems in a field in which she, a mathematician by training, had insufficient background. Possessing a sharp wit and a dynamic, forceful personality, she was not always easy to get along with. Nevertheless, she was also an attractive woman and an inspired teacher who set high standards. AfterÂ Otto Glaser'sÂ death she lived on the Smith College campus, moving to Wood's Hole, Massachusetts, on her retirement in\n1971\n. She died in Falmouth Hospital, Falmouth, Massachusetts, of pneumonia, on\n11\nFebruary\n1976\nand was cremated two days later at Forest Hills crematory, Boston. Her ashes were taken to Wood's Hole.\nIn fact the end of Wrinch's life was much sadder than this quote tells us and we should relate the tragic circumstances. Wrinch's daughter Pamela was awarded a B.A. and an M.A. by Michigan University, then a Ph.D. in international relations by Yale. She wrote the monograph\nThe Military Strategy of Winston Churchill\n(1961)\n, then taught in several institutions including Wellesley College, Boston University and West Virginia University. She married the publisher Alfred S Schenkman in Falmouth, Massachusetts in\n1966\n. In the autumn of\n1975\nPamela moved her mother from her home in Wood's Hole to a nursing home. She was not happy there and Pamela moved her mother back to Wood's Hole and organised\n24\nhour care for her. On\n4\nDecember\n1975\nPamela was in her summer house in Gardiner Road, Wood's Hole, not far from her mother's home. The summer house caught fire and Pamela died. Dorothy Wrinch was devastated to lose her daughter and died around two months later.\nCarey sums up Wrinch's contribution in\n[\n4\n]\n:-\nBy advancing a theory of protein structure that reached beyond the boundaries of classical biology to encompass chemistry, physics, mathematics, and philosophy, she contributed to the development of molecular biology by inspiring other scientists to take a multidisciplinary approach to the study of life.",
