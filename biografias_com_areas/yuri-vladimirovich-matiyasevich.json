  "biografia": "Yuri Vladimirovich Matiyasevich\n's father, Vladimir Mikhailovich Matiyasevich, was a construction engineer. He was not involved in practical aspects of construction but worked in an office drawing up building plans. The family were from the nobility since Vladimir Mikhailovich's father, Mikhail Stepanovich Matiyasevich, was a professional soldier. Yuri's mother, Galina Korotchenko, had wanted to become a doctor but she had not been able to fulfil her ambitions. She had been sent to train as an agronomist, despite not wanting to take this path, and gave up because she disliked the course. During the war she worked as an army typist but after Yuri was born she devoted herself to bringing him up. Yuri was a late child for his father was forty-five years old and his mother thirty-six when he was born.\nHe was brought up in Leningrad where he began his schooling in\n1954\n. As a young child he had health problems and had two spells in hospital for surgery. Before being hospitalised he had learnt to add large numbers but it was while he was in hospital that a nurse taught him to subtract large numbers. He attended, what he describes as \"two very good schools with extra emphasis on mathematics and physics\". The first of these was the Leningrad Lyceum\n239\nfrom which he graduated in\n1963\n. While at this school he developed a passion for making radio sets, succeeding in\n1959\n. However, this was the year in which his father died and the family were left with relatively little money on which to live. Soon, however, Matiyasevich was taking part in Mathematical Olympiad competitions and proving highly successful.\nFrom the Leningrad Lyceum\n239\nhe went to Moscow where he spent a year at the\nA N Kolmogorov\nPhysico-mathematical boarding school No\n18\nwhich was attached to Moscow State University. Although leaving his mother in Leningrad on her own was difficult for him, the opportunity to go to Moscow presented itself when his uncle, who lived in Moscow, offered financial assistance. Matiyasevich had shown his outstanding mathematical abilities while in Leningrad for he had been highly successful in the Leningrad Mathematical Olympiad Competitions between\n1960\nand\n1963\nand in the All-Union Mathematical Olympiads between\n1961\nand\n1963\n. After going to the boarding school in Moscow he was equally successful in the Moscow Mathematical Olympiad of\n1964\nas well as the All-Union Mathematical Olympiad of that year. He competed in the International Mathematical Olympiad held in Moscow in\n1964\nand was awarded a gold medal.\nNot only did his excellent performance in the\n1964\nInternational Mathematical Olympiad bring him wide recognition but it also had the practical effect of allowing him to enter directly into the Department of Mathematics and Mechanics of Leningrad State University without taking any examinations and also to enter a year early, missing out the final year of his school education\n[\n2\n]\n:-\n... at the beginning of his second year, autumn\n1965\n, Matiyasevich was introduced to\nPost\n's canonical systems and his career as a mathematician properly began. He immediately achieved an elegant result on a difficult problem the professor proposed. This led him to meet Maslov, the local expert on\nPost\ncanonical systems. ... Maslov made a number of suggestions for research, which Matiyasevich quickly resolved. In late\n1965\nMaslov suggested a more difficult question about details of the unsolvability of\nThue\nsystems. Matiyasevich solved this problem too.\nHe graduated in\n1969\nand continued to study for his Candidate's degree\n(\nequivalent to a Ph.D.\n)\nat the Leningrad Department of the\nSteklov\nInstitute of Mathematics of the\nUSSR Academy of Sciences\nwith Sergei Maslov as his advisor. While an undergraduate he had already published some important papers\n(\nall in Russian\n)\n:\nSimple examples of unsolvable canonical calculi\n(1967)\n,\nSimple examples of unsolvable associative calculi\n(1967)\n,\nArithmetic representations of powers\n(1968)\n,\nA connection between systems of word and length equations and Hilbert's tenth problem\n(1968)\n, and\nTwo reductions of Hilbert's tenth problem\n(1968)\n. Before continuing to describe Matiyasevich's career, we should look briefly at \"\nHilbert\n's Tenth Problem\".\nIn\n1900\nat the International Congress of Mathematicians in Paris,\nDavid Hilbert\ndecided that he would try to set the agenda for mathematical research for the new century by giving a list of\n23\nproblems.\nHilbert\nsaw that efforts to solve these problems would lead to important advances. In fact his talk at the Congress discussed only ten of the problems, but the full list of\n23\nare discussed in his paper in the Proceedings of the Congress. The Tenth Problem, which interests us here, was not in fact one of the ten which\nHilbert\ndiscussed in his talk. The problem, as stated by\nHilbert\n, is rather different from the way that it is usually stated today so let us look at both aspects. The original problem is:-\nDevise a process according to which it can be determined by a finite number of operations whether a given polynomial equation with integer coefficients in any number of unknowns is solvable in rational integers.\nThe more modern statement would be:-\nDoes there exist an algorithm to determine whether a Diophantine equation has a solution in natural numbers?\nThe differences in these two statements are significant.\nHilbert\nbelieved that an algorithm\n(\ni.e. a process determined by a finite number of operations\n)\nexisted and the problem was to find it. The second version requires the general theory of computability founded by\nGÃ¶del\n,\nChurch\n,\nTuring\nand others in the\n1930\ns before it makes precise sense to ask whether an algorithm to solve a particular problem exists. The fact that the second statement asks for a solution in natural numbers while the first asks for a solution in integers is not significant. They are equivalent using the theorem\nLagrange\nproved in\n1772\n, namely that every natural number can be expressed as the sum of the squares of four integers.\nIn\n1934\nThoralf Skolem\nshowed that to solve\nHilbert\n's Tenth Problem, it is sufficient to consider only\nDiophantine equations\nof total degree four.\nMartin Davis\nmade advances in\n1953\nand he continued to investigate the problem with Hilary Putnam and\nJulia Robinson\n. In fact\nJulia Robinson\ncontinued to make progress towards showing that no algorithm existed, publishing an important paper in\n1952\n. Matiyasevich became interested in\nHilbert\n's Tenth Problem when he was an undergraduate in his second year of study. He was advised by Maslov not to read the papers by 'the American mathematicians' and he made a little progress, publishing his results in the papers we mentioned above. He then read the papers by\nMartin Davis\n, Hilary Putnam, and\nJulia Robinson\nand organised a seminar on\nHilbert\n's Tenth Problem. His fascination with the problem was such that he persisted despite the fact that his teachers and fellow students made fun of him. He said in a November\n1999\ninterview\n(\n[\n6\n]\n, see also\n[\n1\n]\n)\n:-\nOne professor began to laugh at me. Each time we met he would ask: \"Have you proved the unsolvability of\nHilbert\n's tenth problem? Not yet? But then you will not be able to graduate from the university.\"\nEventually he decided that he would have to forget about\nHilbert\n's Tenth Problem and concentrate on other problems for his Candidate's Degree. However\n(\n[\n6\n]\n, see also\n[\n1\n]\n)\n:-\n... one day in the autumn of\n1969\n, some of my colleagues told me, \"rush to the library. In the recent issue of the Proceedings of the\nAmerican Mathematical Society\nthere is a new paper by\nJulia Robinson\n!\" But I was firm in putting\nHilbert\n's tenth problem aside. I told myself, \"It is nice that\nJulia Robinson\ngoes on with the problem, but I cannot waste my time on it any longer.\" So I did not rush to the library. But somewhere in the mathematical heavens there must be a god or goddess of mathematics who would not let me fail to read\nJulia Robinson\n's new paper. Because of my early publications on the subject, I was considered a specialist on the tenth problem, and so the paper was sent to me to review. Thus I was forced to read\nJulia Robinson\n's paper, and\nHilbert\n's tenth problem captured me again. I saw at once that\nJulia Robinson\nhad a fresh and wonderful idea. It was connected with the special form of\nPell\n's equation.\nThe new ideas in\nJulia Robinson\n's paper\nUnsolvable Diophantine problems\n(1969)\nmeant that Matiyasevich could try a new approach to proving that no algorithm existed\n(\n[\n6\n]\n, see also\n[\n1\n]\n)\n:-\nOn the morning of\n3\nJanuary\n1970\n, I believed I had a solution of\nHilbert\n's tenth problem, but by the end of that day I had discovered a flaw in my work. But the next morning I managed to mend the construction. ... I wrote out a detailed proof without finding any mistake and asked Sergei Maslov and Vladimir Lifshitz to check it, but not to say anything about it to anyone else. I had planned to spend the winter holidays with my bride at a ski camp, so I left Leningrad before I got the verdict from Maslov and Lifshitz. For a fortnight I was skiing, simplifying my proof, and writing the paper. ... On my return to Leningrad I received confirmation that my proof was correct, and it was no longer secret. Several other mathematicians also checked the proof, including\nD K Faddeev\nand A A Markov, both of whom were famous for their ability to find errors.\nThe paper he wrote\nThe Diophantineness of enumerable sets\n(\nRussian\n)\nwas published in\n1970\n.\nJ W S Cassels\nwrites:-\nThis paper shows that every recursively enumerable relation is diophantine and so completes the solution of\nHilbert\n's tenth problem in the negative sense. ... The proof is elementary but ingenious and is said to use ideas of\nJulia Robinson\n...\nMatiyasevich also published\nSolution of the tenth problem of Hilbert\nin Hungarian in\n1970\n.\nSolving a problem from\nHilbert\n's famous list took him immediately to the position of one of the world's leading researchers in mathematics. He was awarded his Candidate's degree in\n1970\nand was appointed as a researcher in the Leningrad Department of the\nSteklov\nInstitute of Mathematics of the\nUSSR Academy of Sciences\n. He received the \"Young mathematician\" prize from the\nLeningrad Mathematical Society\nin this same year and received world-wide recognition when he presented his result in his lecture\nDiophantine representation of recursively enumerable predicates\nat the International Congress of Mathematicians in Nice in August\n1970\n. In\n1972\nhe was awarded his doctorate\n(\nequivalent to a D.Sc. or\nhabilitation\n)\nfor his thesis\nDiophantine representation of enumerable predicates\nwhich he defended on\n24\nFebruary. In this thesis, as well as giving a simplified proof that no algorithm exists to determine whether Diophantine equations have integer solutions, he gave a Diophantine representation of a wide class of natural number sequences produced by linear recurrence relations. He also constructed a particular polynomial of degree\n21\nwith\n21\nvariables which has as its positive range precisely the set of prime numbers.\nTwo years later, in\n1974\n, he was promoted to Senior Researcher. During these years Matiyasevich corresponded with\nJulia Robinson\nand the two undertook joint research projects together. This was far more difficult than it sounds, for the cold war meant that all their letters were examined by Soviet censors. They met for the first time at the International Congress for Logic, Methodology and Philosophy of Sciences held in Bucharest, Romania in\n1971\nwhere Matiyasevich gave the lecture\nOn recursive unsolvability of Hilbert's tenth problem\nin which he described the joint work he had been carrying out with\nJulia Robinson\n. In\n1980\nMatiyasevich was appointed head of the Laboratory of Mathematical Logic at the Leningrad Department of the Steklov Institute. In\n1995\nhe was also appointed as Professor of Software Engineering at St Petersburg State University\n(\nLeningrad had reverted to its original name of St Petersburg in\n1991)\n. Later he was appointed to the chair of Algebra and Number Theory\nMatiyasevich published the book\nHilbert's tenth problem\nin Russian in\n1993\nand, in the same year, an English translation was published. A French translation was published in\n1995\n. Cristian Calude writes in a review of the English translation:-\nThe book is divided into ten chapters. The first five lead to the negative solution of\nHilbert\n's Tenth Problem; the remaining chapters are devoted to various applications of the method used by the author, which is, in a sense, more important than the solution itself: it has applications to\nHilbert\n's eighth problem, decision problems in number theory, Diophantine complexity, decision problems in calculus, and Diophantine games. ... The book is well written. It will be of great value not only to readers directly interested in\nHilbert\n's Tenth Problem, but, in a broader sense, to potential users of some efficient Diophantine codings.\nValentina Harizanov writes\n[\n5\n]\n:-\nThis book is exceptional in the sense that all its parts are interesting and important - not only its text, but also its exercises, its commentaries, its appendix, and its foreword in the English translation.\nLet us give brief details of some more recent work by Matiyasevich. In\n2004\nhe published\nElimination of quantifiers from arithmetical formulas defining recursively enumerable sets\nwhich he summarises as follows:-\nThis is a short survey of known results about elimination of quantifiers over natural numbers, and some implications of these results on the power of computer algebra systems.\nAlso in\n2004\nhe published\nSome probabilistic restatements of the four color conjecture\nin which he showed that the four colour conjecture can be restated as a small number of assertions about correlations of some random events. These random events are defined in a probabilistic space associated to a triangulation of a sphere. His paper\nExistential arithmetization of Diophantine equations\n(2009)\ncontinues work related to\nHilbert\n's Tenth problem and, as Alexandra Shlapentokh writes:-\n... continues his investigation of coding methods by introducing a coding scheme which, among other things, leads to the elimination of bounded quantifiers, arithmetization of\nTuring\nmachines, and a much simplified construction of a universal Diophantine equation.\nIn\n2010\nhe published\nOne more probabilistic reformulation of the four colour conjecture\ncontinuing the investigation described in the above\n2004\npaper.\nOf the many honours given to Matiyasevich we mention that he was: awarded the\nA A Markov\nPrize of the\nUSSR Academy of Sciences\n(1980)\n; awarded an honorary doctorate by l'UniversitÃ© d'Auvergne\n(1996)\n; elected a corresponding member of the\nRussian Academy of Sciences\n(1997)\n; received the Humboldt Research Award to Outstanding Scholars\n(1998)\n; elected vice-president of the\nSt Petersburg Mathematical Society\n(1998)\n; awarded an honorary doctorate by l'UniversitÃ© Pierre et Marie Curie in Paris\n(2003)\n; elected to the Bavarian Academy of Sciences\n(2007)\n; and elected as a full member of the\nRussian Academy of Sciences\n(2008)\n. He serves on the editorial boards of\nDiscrete Mathematics and Applications\nand of\nComputer Instruments in Education\n.",
