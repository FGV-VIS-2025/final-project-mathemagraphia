  "biografia": "Norman Alling\nwas the son of Harold Lattimore Alling and Merle Kolb. He entered Bard College, Annandale-on-Hudson, New York, in\n1948\n. Bard College was founded in\n1860\nas St Stephen's, an Episcopal college for men, but in\n1928\nit became the undergraduate college for Columbia University. However it ended its relationship with Columbia in\n1944\nso by the time Alling entered it was a private, coeducational institution of higher learning. He studied there for four years obtaining a B.A. in\n1952\n.\nAfter the award of his Bachelor's Degree, Alling entered Columbia University in New York and was awarded his Master's Degree in\n1954\n. Then he undertook research under Robert Taylor but in\n1955\nhe began lecturing in mathematics which he continued at Columbia until\n1957\n. It was on\n20\nAugust\n1957\nthat he married Katharine McPherson Page; they had two children Elizabeth Larrabee Alling and Margaret Tilden Alling. In\n1958\nhe was awarded his Ph.D. for his thesis\nOn Ordered Divisible Groups\n. A paper containing the main results of his doctoral thesis was published in the\nTransactions of the American Mathematical Society\nin\n1960\n. Alling did not remain at Columbia University to finish off writing his thesis, however, but rather took up an appointment as an assistant professor at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana, in\n1957\nafter he stopped lecturing at Columbia. Awarded a National Sciences Foundation postdoctoral fellowship, he spent the year\n1961\n-\n62\nat Harvard University, being promoted to associate professor at Purdue in\n1962\n. He had, by this time, begun working in new areas of algebra publishing papers such as\nOn exponentially closed fields\n(1962)\n,\nAn application of valuation theory to rings of continuous real and complex-valued functions\n(1963)\n, and\nThe valuation theory of meromorphic function fields over open Riemann surfaces\n(1963)\n.\nIt was around this time that\nRibenboim\nand Alling first met.\nRibenboim\nwrites in the Preface of\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nBoth Norman and I shared a strong interest in the theory of valuations and this topic continues to link us.\nAlling lectured at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology from\n1962\nto\n1964\nwhen he was awarded a National Sciences Foundation Senior Postdoctoral Fellowship which enabled him to spend\n1964\n-\n65\nundertaking research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He was appointed to the University of Rochester, in Rochester, New York, in\n1965\nas an associate professor. Now back in the town of his birth, he was promoted to full professor in\n1970\n. He remained at Rochester for the rest of his career, retiring in\n1992\nwhen he was made professor emeritus.\nDavid Singerman, reviewing\n[\n1\n]\n, writes that the topics that Alling studied:-\n... cover a wide range of mathematics, from the theory of ordered groups to\nRiemann\nsurfaces. Perhaps the breadth of Alling's interests can be deduced from the titles of his books. One such book, written jointly with N Greenleaf, is 'Foundations of the theory of\nKlein\nsurfaces'.\nKlein\nsurfaces are surfaces with a dianalytic structure, and those that are compact represent real algebraic curves in the same way as compact\nRiemann\nsurfaces represent complex algebraic curves. This led to the publication of another book 'Real elliptic curves' in\n1981\n. This is a very different type of book which started with\n18\nth\n-century work on\nelliptic functions\n. The third book 'Foundations of analysis over surreal number fields' appeared in\n1987\n, and includes an account of\nConway\n's theory of surreal numbers. Many of\n[\nhis\n]\npapers are concerned with related topics.\nC Earle, reviewing\nFoundations of the theory of Klein surfaces\n, writes:-\n... the authors develop basic function theory on\nKlein\nsurfaces and explore the relation between compact\nKlein\nsurfaces and real algebraic function fields. They show that the compact\nKlein\nsurfaces are related to real algebraic function fields in the same way that the closed\nRiemann\nsurfaces are to complex algebraic function fields. They also show that every\nKlein\nsurface can be represented as the quotient of a\n(\nperhaps not connected\n)\nRiemann\nsurface by a conjugate analytic involution.\nKlein\nsurfaces are thus natural objects of study, and this book provides a useful introduction to their properties.\nManfred Knebusch described Alling's approach to his topic in\nReal elliptic curves\n. Here is a short extract from his description:-\nThe book consists of an introduction and three parts with the headings \"Elliptic integrals\", \"Elliptic functions\" and \"Real elliptic curves\". The first two parts offer a detailed and scrupulous presentation of the historical development of the theory of elliptic integrals and functions in the\n18\nth\nand\n19\nth\ncenturies, from\nGiulio Fagnano\nand\nEuler\nthrough\nLegendre\n,\nGauss\n,\nAbel\nand\nJacobi\nto\nRiemann\nand\nWeierstrass\n. Although these two parts amount to roughly two-thirds of the book and form an effective self-contained whole, they only supply the background for the last part, in which the author deals with the actual theme of the book and also with his own contribution to the theory of real elliptic curves.\nFoundations of analysis over surreal number fields\nis described by L MÃ¡rki:-\nAs indicated by the title, the book aims at laying the foundations of analysis over these fields. This is done in such a way that all the preliminaries are developed in full detail, which makes the book accessible at the graduate student level. Its expository nature is also revealed by the wealth of examples and by the comments comparing various approaches when tackling certain problems. On the other hand, the book contains many new results - in fact, analysis over surreal number fields seems to make its first appearance here.\nA student who was taught by Alling at Rochester in the\n1970\ns wrote:-\nDuring our four semesters together, we students formed strong friendships with each other that were to continue well past graduation. Just as important, our prolonged contact with the same professor - Norman Alling in my year  - gave us a deeper appreciation of the mindset of a professional mathematician.\nAfter he retired, Alling continued to undertake research. For example, in\n1995\nat a conference on 'Ordered algebraic structure' in CuraÃ§ao he presented a paper\nContinuous ultraproducts\nwhich appeared in the conference proceedings in\n1997\n.\nFinally we note Alling's love for skiing on the slopes in Colorado.",
