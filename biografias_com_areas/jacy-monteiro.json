  "biografia": "Luiz Henrique Jacy Monteiro\nwas the son of Ernesto Maia Jacy Monteiro\n(1888\n-\n1971)\nand Manoelita de Castiho\n(\nborn\n1888)\n. Ernesto and Manoelita were married on\n20\nNovember\n1909\nin Rio de Janeiro.\nLuiz Henrique had an older brother Roberto Jacy Monteiro\n(\nborn\n1918)\nand a younger sister Maria da Gloria Jacy Monteiro\n(\nborn\n1923)\n. Ernesto Jacy Monteiro was a mining engineer with a talent for languages which he employed as a translator.\nThe first difficulty that we have to consider is the date of Luiz Henrique's birth. Most biographies we have consulted give his date of birth as\n6\nJuly\n1921\n. On the form he completed when entering the United States in\n1947\n, however, he gives his date of birth as\n6\nNovember\n1918\n. Some facts support the\n1921\ndate such as having Osvaldo Sangiorgi\n(\nborn\n1921)\nas a close childhood friend, and the fact that Jacy Monteiro began his university studies in\n1940\n. To add to the confusion, he gives his age on other travel forms which seem inconsistent with both these possible dates, for example he gave age\n27\non\n10\nSeptember\n1947\n, and age\n29\non\n14\nJanuary\n1949\n. The form approving his Rockefeller Scholarship in\n1947\n, however, gives his age as\n29\nwhich is consistent with the\n1918\ndate of birth.\nLuiz Henrique spent his first years in Rio de Janeiro where he began his primary education. When he was ten years old the family moved to a big house in Vila GalvÃ£o to the north east of the city of SÃ£o Paulo. There he became friends with Osvaldo Sangiorgi\n(1921\n-\n2017)\nand the two remained friends for life. Sangiorgi also became a mathematician, teaching and writing textbooks. At Vila GalvÃ£o, Sangiorgi and Jacy Monteiro enjoyed bicycle rides and they swam in the Lago dos Patos close to the Jacy Monteiro house. When they wanted to rest, they often listened to music, particularly Bach and Vivaldi.\nJacy Monteiro showed great abilities in mathematics and in languages when at school. He also showed great talent as a chess player and surprised all his friends with his remarkable memory. Not surprisingly, his father wanted him to become an engineer so after an outstanding performance in the maturity examinations, he began studying engineering at the ColÃ©gio UniversitÃ¡rio da Escola PolitÃ©cnica of the University of SÃ£o Paulo in\n1940\n. He quickly found that, although he greatly enjoyed the mathematics courses, he did not enjoy the technical studies required for the engineering course. He took a Mathematical Analysis course at the Escola PolitÃ©cnica taught by\nCÃ¢ndido Lima da Silva Dias\n.\nSilva Dias\nhad himself been a student at the Escola PolitÃ©cnica but, finding mathematics more to his liking than engineering, had continued his studies at the newly founded Faculdade de Filosofia, CiÃªncias e Letras where he became an assistant to\nLuigi FantappiÃ¨\n.\nSilva Dias\nencouraged Jacy Monteiro to leave the Escola PolitÃ©cnica and study at the Department of Mathematics in the Faculdade de Filosofia, CiÃªncias e Letras. In\n1941\nhe began his studies there taking courses in Pure Mathematics which were much more to his liking. The classes were small and he graduated in\n1943\nwith four classmates. Let us give some details of the Department of Mathematics.\nThe University of SÃ£o Paulo was founded inÂ\n1934\nÂ and professors were brought to SÃ£o Paulo from France, Italy and Germany. The first mathematics professor that was brought was\nLuigi FantappiÃ¨\nwho travelled to Brazil from Italy in\n1933\n.\nCÃ¢ndido Silva Dias\nbegan studying mathematics at the Polytechnic School in\n1932\nand became one of\nFantappiÃ¨\n's first students. In\n1934\nOmar Catunda\nwas appointed as\nFantappiÃ¨\n's assistant and they collaborated on starting up the Mathematics Subsection of the Faculty of Philosophy, Sciences and Letters at the University of SÃ£o Paulo with\nFantappiÃ¨\nas its head.\nCÃ¢ndido Silva Dias\nwas appointed as\nFantappiÃ¨\n's assistant in\n1937\nand taught in the Mathematics Department for\n54\nyears retiring in\n1990\n.\nFantappiÃ¨\nreturned to Italy at the outbreak of World War II inÂ\n1939\nÂ when he was offered the Chair of Higher Analysis in the University of Rome, a position he held for the rest of his life.\nCatunda\nwas appointed, on an interim basis, as professor responsible for the chair of Mathematical and Higher Analysis, replacing\nFantappiÃ¨\n. In\n1944\nJacy Monteiro was appointed as\nCÃ¢ndido Silva Dias\n's assistant in Higher Geometry.\nElza Gomide\nwas appointed as\nCatunda\n's assistant in\n1945\nand, in the same year\nOscar Zariski\narrived to give courses on \"Modern Algebra\" and \"Introduction to Algebraic Geometry.\"\nJean DieudonnÃ©\nwas appointed professor of mathematics at Sao Paulo for\n1946\n-\n47\n.\nZariski\nlectured in English and\nDieudonnÃ©\nlectured in French. Jacy Monteiro's outstanding language skills were put to good use and he was able to attend\nZariski\n's courses and\nDieudonnÃ©\n's courses and take notes directly into Portuguese.\nElza Gomide\nwrote\n(\nsee\n[\n17\n]\n)\n:-\nZariski\n's influence on Jacy Monteiro was enormous, he wrote the class notes and published them in the form of a handout. The impulse received by the algebraist was decisive for his research and was also extended when\nZariski\ntook him to Harvard to continue developing the research started in Brazil. I think\nZariski\nwas a very effective teacher.\nAs an example, let us note that\nZariski\n's course\nIntroduction to the Theory of Ideals\nwas translated into Portuguese by Jacy Monteiro and published as\n[\n18\n]\n. It begins:-\nAlgebraic Geometry had great development in the Italian school; the works of\nSegre\n,\nBertini\nand especially those of\nCastelnuovo\n,\nEnriques\nand\nSeveri\ngave a classic aspect to this branch of Mathematics. These masters developed Algebraic Geometry from the point of view of geometric intuition. It should be noted that the Algebraic Geometry developed by the Italian school had a major defect: lack of rigour. For this reason - due to the lack of rigorous methods - the Italian school declined and Algebraic Geometry was isolated from Modern Mathematics. In the last\n15\nyears, works have appeared in which new methods and concepts have been developed for the study of Algebraic Geometry. The first works are due to\nvan der Waerden\n,\nO Zariski\n,\nWeyl\n,\nChevalley\n, etc. We have a resurgence of Algebraic Geometry from which we are going to point out two fundamental consequences:\n1\nst the use of algebraic methods guarantees us perfect definitions and the absolute rigour of the demonstrations;\n2\nnd the use of these methods, leads us to a great generality of study, because the theorems of Algebraic Geometry, which will be demonstrated by algebraic means, are valid not only in the field of complex numbers, but also in abstract fields.\nThe SÃ£o Paulo Mathematical Society was founded in\n1945\nwith\nOmar Catunda\nas its first president. Jacy Monteiro served as General Secretary during\n1945\n-\n48\n. After\n1948\nhe became Director of Publications of the Society. In this role he was in continual correspondence with mathematicians from several countries, and postcards still exist which were sent to him from countries such as Venezuela, Yugoslavia, Romania and Japan.\nJacy Monteiro produced many booklets and these were sold to the students. Not only did he translate lecture courses by foreign teachers but he also produced Analysis Course handouts since he was teaching that course himself.\nOmar Catunda\nwrote to Jacy Monteiro from Miami on\n14\nSeptember\n1946\nthanking him for his work and asking about printing costs and money received from selling the booklets. Eventually\nCatunda\nworried that he was expecting so much of Jacy Monteiro in producing these booklets that he may not have time to undertake other work. He wrote this in a letter of\n15\nApril\n1947\nwhen he also expressed concern about\nAndrÃ© Weil\n's departure. Jacy Monteiro was employed as an assistant to\nJean DieudonnÃ©\nin\n1947\nbut later that year he took up the Rockefeller scholarship he had received. He had been awarded this scholarship with\nZariski\n's support.\nBy the time that Jacy Monteiro's Rockefeller scholarship was approved, on\n9\nJune\n1947\n, he had married Martha Anna Dorothea Wallbaum and they had a child, Luiz Henrique Jacy Monteiro Filho, who was one year old.\n[\nWe can note here that he later had a second child, a daughter Layse Helena Jacy Monteiro.\n]\nThe letter approving the award of the scholarship states:-\nHe will return to Brazil to his full time post as Assistant in the Department of Mathematics in the Faculdade de Filosofia, CiÃªncias e Letras of the University of SÃ£o Paulo. His sponsors are Dean Andre Dreyfus and Prof\nJean A DieudonnÃ©\nof the Faculdade de Filosofia, CiÃªncias e Letras of the University of SÃ£o Paulo. Program: Algebraic Geometry with Prof\nOscar Zariski\n, University of Illinois; and/or other authorised centres. A fellowship for Luiz Henrique Jacy Monteiro is hereby approved for a period not to exceed twelve months beginning approximately September\n15\n,\n1947\n, with stipend of $\n175\nper month and provision for necessary fees and travel expenses.\nHe entered the United States at New York on\n11\nSeptember\n1947\non his way to Harvard University. Details on his record of temporary admission to the USA are: Home Address, Christiane Viana\n551\n, SÃ£o Paulo; Hair, brown; Eyes, green; Height,\n5\nft\n9\nin. We should note that he was not accompanied by his wife and son who both remained in SÃ£o Paulo. At Harvard, he attended lectures by\nOscar Zariski\n, then he went to the University of Chicago where he attended the Algebraic Functions course taught by\nSaunders Mac Lane\n. Jacy Monteiro's paper\nDerivations of a field\n(\nPortuguese\n)\n, was published in\n1947\n.\nJean DieudonnÃ©\nwrites in the review\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nThis is mainly an expository article on derivations of a field, most of the results being well-known theorems of\nA Weil\n,\nO Zariski\nand\nS Mac Lane\n. The most original part of the paper concerns the case of separable extensions in the sense of\nN Bourbaki\n(\nextensions \"preserving p-independence'', introduced by\nS Mac Lane\n)\n; the author proves that they are exactly the extensions in which any derivation of the subfield can be extended; from that criterion he deduces new proofs of results of\nS Mac Lane\non the existence of separating transcendence bases.\nHe returned to Brazil leaving New York on\n14\nJanuary\n1949\non the ship\nUruguay\n. He took up the position of assistant to\nCandido Lima da Silva Dias\non\n2\nMay\n1949\n. On\n21\nApril\n1949\nZariski\nhad written to Harry Milton Miller\n(1895\n-\n1980)\n, the Associate Director of the Rockefeller Foundation reporting on Jacy Monteiro:-\nMy estimate of Jacy Monteiro takes into account the relatively low level of mathematics in Brazil. I am judging the man against the background of local conditions. While I am not sure that he will do research of more than average in Brazil, he will contribute substantially to the development of Brazilian mathematics. He has a first hand working knowledge of the modern methods in algebra and geometry which nobody else in SÃ£o Paulo possesses. He is not a genius, of course, but he is intelligent, capable and very industrious, and I fully expect him to play a leading part among the mathematicians of SÃ£o Paulo. I know of only one young man in Brazil who is more promising that Monteiro, and that is\nLeopoldo Nachbin\n.\nZariski\n's assessment of Jacy Monteiro proved very accurate.\nJacy Monteiro wrote to Harry Milton Miller on\n30\nDecember\n1949\n:-\nI have your letter of December\n9\n,\n1949\n. We have in the library of the Department of Mathematics all the publications of the\nBourbaki\nGroup. I thank you very much for the help you offered us. I shall take in the next year the examinations for getting my doctor's degree: on this occasion I shall present a thesis which I wrote under\nZariski\n's direction. I would like to ask you for some help in getting micro-films which are made by the Mathematical Reviews.\nThe Rockefeller Foundation approved a grant for providing the micro-films and Jacy Monteiro defended his thesis\nSobre as potÃªncias simbÃ³licas de um ideal primo de um anel de polinÃ´mios\nâ\n(\nOn the symbolic powers of a prime ideal of a ring of polynomials\n)\non\n19\nApril\n1951\n. The examining board was composed of\nCÃ¢ndido Lima da Silva Dias\n,\nOmar Catunda\n, Benedito Castrucci, Afonso Penteado de Toledo Piza and\nLeopoldo Nachbin\n. The board was chaired by\nCÃ¢ndido Lima da Silva Dias\nwho was Jacy Monteiro's official thesis advisor even though in practice he had been advised by\nZariski\n. He wrote in the thesis:-\nI want to express my thanks to Prof\nO Zariski\nfor suggesting the above problem and for the guidance provided during the preparation of this work.\nJacy Monteiro had taken examinations on the two subsidiary subjects Algebra and Projective Geometry on\n12\nApril and he was awarded the maximum score for both these examinations, and for his defence of his thesis.\nIn addition to teaching at the University of SÃ£o Paulo, from\n1956\nhe also taught Modern Algebra at Mackenzie University in SÃ£o Paulo. This private Protestant University had been founded as the American School in\n1870\nand later became Mackenzie College before achieving university status in\n1952\n. Jacy Monteiro was also professor of Algebra and Trigonometry at the School for Officers of the Police Force of the State of SÃ£o Paulo in the district of Sant' Anna, Barro Branco.\nJacy Monteiro attended the first Brazilian Mathematics Colloquium in\n1957\nat PoÃ§os de Caldas, Minas Gerais and delivered one of the courses on\nTeoria de Galois\nâ\n(\nGalois theory\n)\n.\nYou can see more about the Brazilian Mathematics Colloquiums at\nTHIS LINK\nand you can see him in the conference photograph at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nHe was the organiser of both the Fifth Brazilian Mathematics Colloquium in\n1965\nand the Sixth Brazilian Mathematics Colloquium in\n1967\n. He gave the Scientific Initiation Course on\nTeoria de Galois\nâ\n(\nGalois theory\n)\nat the Seventh Brazilian Mathematics Colloquium in\n1969\n. These three Colloquia were all held in PoÃ§os de Caldas. We can note that the SÃ£o Paulo Mathematical Society, in which Jacy Monteiro played a highly active role, ceased to exist when it became part of the\nBrazilian Mathematical Society\nfounded during the Seventh Brazilian Mathematics Colloquium.\nHe published his lectures on\nGalois\nTheory in\n1969\nand these were reviewed by J S Joel\n[\n7\n]\n:-\nThese are notes from a\n1968\ngraduate course. The treatment is close to those in\nE Artin\n's classic books. After some preliminaries in Chapter\n1\n, Chapter\n2\nis devoted to algebraic elements and algebraic extensions, centred around the existence of the splitting field of a non-constant polynomial. Chapter\n3\nis concerned with geometric constructions, such as the impossibility of solving via straightedge and compass the classical problems of the quadrature of the circle, the duplication of the cube and the trisection of an angle. Chapter\n4\nis devoted to separable and normal extensions, preparatory to the study of\nGalois\nextensions in Chapter\n5\n(\nincluding the fundamental theorem of\nGalois\ntheory\n)\n. Chapter\n6\ncontains applications of\nGalois\ntheory: rational symmetric fractions, simple extensions, roots of unity\n(\nincluding the construction of the regular polygons\n)\n; finite fields; cyclic extensions, the solution of algebraic equations by radicals.\nThis book was only one of several by Jacy Monteiro. Others include:\nÃlgebra linear\nâ\n(\nLinear algebra\n)\n(1960)\n;\nÃlgebra multilinear\nâ\n(\nMultilinear algebra\n)\n(1964)\n;\nAlgebra moderna\nâ\n(\nModern algebra\n)\n(1964)\n;\nTÃ³picos de Ã¡lgebra\nâ\n(\nAlgebra topics\n)\n(1970)\n;\nIniciaÃ§Ã£o Ã s estruturas algÃ©bricas\nâ\n(\nIntroduction to algebraic structures\n)\n(1971)\n; and\nElementos de Algebra\nâ\n(\nElements of algebra\n)\n(1974)\n. These works were part of a long term project by Jacy Monteiro to make Brazilian teachers at all different levels aware of modern mathematical developments. For example, in July\n1961\nhe gave one of three courses put on for secondary school teachers which were delivered in Santos. Later that year, from\n1\nAugust to\n30\nSeptember, the First Improvement Course for Secondary Mathematics Teachers was held at Mackenzie University, in SÃ£o Paulo. At both of these Jacy Monteiro delivered a course on Modern Algebra. In October\n1961\n, GEEM\n(\nGrupo de Estudos do Ensino da MatemÃ¡tica\n)\nwas created with Osvaldo Sangiorgi as its president. Jacy Monteiro became its director of publications. GEEM put on many series of courses aimed at improving mathematics education in schools, but it also held discussion sessions in which the members of GEEM debated the best ways to teach modern mathematics. As an example, let us note that he gave a Modern Algebra course in February\n1965\nto around\n400\nteachers from schools across the whole of Brazil. It was claimed to be the largest gathering of mathematics teachers ever to have taken place in SÃ£o Paulo up to that time. Jacy Monteiro's\n1971\nbook listed above is published by GEEM and is a printed version of one of the courses he gave.\nIn\n[\n3\n]\nDuarte reports on a interview by Ubiratan D'Ambrosio and Alexandre Rodrigues Martins in\n1998\nin which they discussed a course they had taken from Jacy Monteiro:-\nD'Ambrosio: A third year advanced course ... The Higher Geometry course, which was actually a Commutative Algebra course.\nMartins: Given by Jacy ...\nD'Ambrosio: Given by Jacy, a great teacher.\nMartins: Yes, a great teacher, an excellent course. In fact, a course that at that time would have been considered a very good course at any university in the world. ... It was something that scientifically and mathematically was well advanced in relation to what was published in the world.\nThere is no doubt that\nZariski\n's assessment of Jacy Monteiro at an early stage in his career was very accurate. His research contributions were relatively minor yet his teacher training work and his making available to Brazilian students the works of leading algebraists proved extraordinarily valuable to the building of mathematical education in Brazil.\nIn\n1975\n, when still in his\n50\ns, Jacy Monteiro underwent a surgical operation. After the operation he suffered a stroke which resulted in his death. His lifelong friend Osvaldo Sangiorgi wrote in\n[\n14\n]\n:-\nApparently, Jacy Monteiro presented himself as phlegmatic and introverted, characteristics that could be confused with shyness, but, in fact, those who approached him clearly perceived his immense human warmth, the rectitude of his character, tempered by a fine sense of humour, supported by a prodigious memory. He jokingly and extremely easily stored phone numbers and important dates of his friends. I remember a certain occasion, when I didn't remember my first phone number at the house where I lived in Vila Mariana. Five years after moving house, Jacy, provoked by a friendly challenge, instantly reproduced the old telephone number.\nSangiorgi also described Jacy Monteiro as\n[\n14\n]\n:-\n... one of the more active and beloved professors. As a professor of the highest calibre, he honoured student activities, from the seriousness with which he presided over elections, to the enthusiastic participation in chess and table tennis tournaments, sports in which he was a master and almost always came out victorious.",
