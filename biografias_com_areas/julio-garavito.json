  "biografia": "Julio Garavito\nwas the son of the merchant Jose Vicente HermÃ³genes Garavito Oropesa\n(1829\n-\n1881)\nand his wife Dolores Armero de la Cala\n(\n-\n1900)\nboth of whom had been born in BogotÃ¡. HermÃ³genes and Dolores had seven children who were all born in BogotÃ¡: JosÃ© MarÃ­a Garavito Armero\n(1860\n-\n1904)\n; Jorge Garavito Armero\n(1862\n-\n1920)\n; Julio Garavito Armero\n(1865\n-\n1920)\n, the subject of this biography; JosÃ© Felipe Hermogenes Garavito Armero\n(1868\n-\n1869)\n; Justino Garavito Armero\n(1871\n-\n1926)\n; Fernando Garavito Armero\n(1874\n-\n1927)\n; and MarÃ­a Teresa Garavito Armero\n(1877\n-\n1927)\n.\nColombia had achieved independence from Spain in\n1810\nbecoming the Republic of Gran Colombia, then became the Republic of New Granada before changing its name to the United States of Colombia in\n1863\n, two years before Julio Garavito was born. This last name change was the result of a civil war in\n1860\n-\n62\n. Another civil war in\n1876\n-\n77\nwas a result of a dispute over education, with the Liberal Party attempting to introduce public education while the Conservative Party wanted education under the control of the Roman Catholic Church. In\n1875\n, at the age of ten, Julio Garavito began his schooling at the Colegio de San BartolomÃ© in BogotÃ¡. This college had been run by the Jesuits but, by the time that Julio began his studies there, it had been nationalised and was being run by the state. Already he had a strong interest in astronomy and, when only eleven years old, he produced his first almanac.\nHermÃ³genes Garavito faced bankruptcy, probably due to fluctuations in the foreign markets, and moved to FusagasugÃ¡, about\n55\nkm southwest of BogotÃ¡, with the three youngest children Justino, Fernando and MarÃ­a Teresa while Julio and his two older brothers remained in BogotÃ¡ for their education. We note that by this time there were only six children, JosÃ© Felipe Hermogenes Garavito having died in\n1869\n.\nAt the Colegio de San BartolomÃ©, Julio Garavito was taught mathematics by Luis MarÃ­a Lleras\n(1842\n-\n1885)\n. Lleras was an excellent mathematician who had translated\nLegendre\n's\nÃlÃ©ments de GÃ©omÃ©trie\nâ\n(\nElements of geometry\n)\ninto Spanish and published it in\n1866\n. In\n1883\nLleras talked about his pupil\n(\nsee for example\n[\n6\n]\n)\n:-\n... Julio Garavito is that young man who expresses himself with such difficulty, yet he is, of all the students I have known, the only one who has a true mathematical spirit. Look at the way he reasons, at the rigour of his logic and at the depth of his analysis, and you will see that he is truly a superior intelligence.\nGaravito graduated from the Colegio de San BartolomÃ© in\n1884\nbut again in this year the United States of Colombia saw a civil war which grew more serious in\n1885\n, with a rebellion by radical groups from the Liberal Party against the government, leading to the Battle of La Humareda. Luis MarÃ­a Lleras, Garavito's former mathematics teacher, was killed in this battle. The civil war saw the universities closed from\n1885\nto\n1887\n. It also led to the declaration of the Republic of Colombia in\n1886\n. When the National University of Colombia, which had been founded in\n1867\n, reopened in\n1887\n, Garavito began his studies of mathematics and civil engineering by enrolling in Practical Geometry, Trigonometry and Analytical Geometry. He graduated in\n1891\nhaving submitted three theses\n[\n23\n]\n:-\nFor his first mathematics thesis, he proposed a probabilistic approach to calculating Ï, while for his second, he calculated all the mathematical possibilities that a pressure gauge could have. In his final thesis, this one in engineering, Julio Garavito proposed a triangular structure to build bridges just like the Sydney Harbour Bridge.\nGaravito's mathematical thesis was entitled\nEl Juego de la Aguja\nâ\n(\nThe game of needles\n)\nwhich looked at probabilistic approaches to calculating Ï in the spirit of the\nComte de Buffon\n's needle experiment. He was appointed to the chairs of Infinitesimal Calculus, Rational Mechanics and Astronomy at the National University of Colombia.\nDue to his outstanding performance, Garavito was appointed as head of the National Observatory of Colombia in\n1892\n. This observatory, built in\n1803\non the initiative of the Spanish priest, botanist, and mathematician JosÃ© Celestino Mutis\n1732\n-\n1808)\n, had seen periods when scientific activity ceased as for example from\n1816\nto\n1823\nafter it had been used by those conspiring to overthrow Spanish rule, between\n1848\nand\n1859\nwhen it had been a military college and even an ice cream shop, and in the\n1860\ns when it had been used as a fortress and a prison.\nGaravito married MarÃ­a Luisa Cadena\n(1872\n-\n1917)\non\n23\nMay\n1893\nin BogotÃ¡. She had been born in FusagasugÃ¡, the daughter of Guillermo Cadena and Lucinda Reyes Vargas. Let us note that MarÃ­a Luisa Cadena had a sister Isabel Cadena who married Julio Garavito's younger brother Justino Garavito who became a mathematician, astronomer and cartographer. Justino Garavito graduated from the National University of Colombia, became a Professor of Mathematics and Engineering and an official at the Office of Longitudes. He was a founding member of the Geographical Society of Colombia.\nAnother civil war had broken out in Colombia in\n1899\nand, known as the War of a Thousand Days, lasted until\n1903\n. It was fought between the Liberal Party who represented coffee plantation owners and import-export merchants, and the ruling Conservative Party. It started when the international price of coffee fell heavily. It is estimated that around\n100\n,\n000\npeople died in the war which resulted in widespread damage to property and was a disaster for the economy of Colombia. It was during this war that the Nine Point Circle Society formed around Julio Garavito; for more information on this Society, named after\nEuler\n's nine point circle, see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nIn\n1897\nGaravito published\nLatitud del observatorio de BogotÃ¡\nâ\n(\nLatitude of the Bogota Observatory\n)\nwhich contained the series of observations he had made to determine the latitude of the BogotÃ¡ Observatory. This document, however, went much further in advocating a plan to measure the country. He had conceived a cartographic plan for a country which he described as \"sparsely populated, without communication routes, covered by thick forest, extensive moors, lagoons and inaccessible swamps, crossed by very high mountain ranges, and exposed to continual political shocks that make any technical organisation temporary.\" Also in\n1897\nhe published\nLos nÃºmeros inconmensurables\nâ\n(\nThe irrational numbers\n)\n, and two years later\nReseÃ±a histÃ³rica del Observatorio AstronÃ³mico de BogotÃ¡\nâ\n(\nHistory of the BogotÃ¡ Astronomical Observatory\n)\n.\nThe War of a Thousand Days had a major impact on Colombia and engineers, professors and students decided to take refuge in the Observatory during the conflict. Garavito organised informal teaching sessions, seminars and other activities for this broad range of scientists. The civil war caused government finances to collapse and it decided to suspend and close activities in various state agencies and institutions, among them the Faculty of Mathematics and Engineering, and the National Astronomical Observatory. Garavito became the informal director of the Faculty of Mathematics and Engineering, set up in the Observatory. Ricardo Lleras Codazzi, a mining engineer, geologist, mineralogist and naturalist, writes\n[\n15\n]\n:-\nDuring the great revolution from\n1899\nto\n1902\n, the Director of the National Observatory was not idle; apart from the many questions of mathematics that he studied conscientiously as a distraction, he busied himself putting his notes in order to write the mechanics course that he developed by an original method, and tackled the analysis of the most difficult problems of algebra: the general solution of equations of degree higher than the second. He departed from the best known path of science, which consists of finding out the number of real and imaginary roots that the equation admits, the limits within which they are included and their general properties, to determine them by successive approximations, and preferred to relate the properties of the roots with certain lines of the star polygons that came to be the key to the desired solutions. In order to achieve his goal, it was necessary for him to establish new theories and to investigate hitherto unknown properties of figures, in a word, almost to create a science to which the name of polygonometry would be appropriate. Once these foundations were established, he based on them his analysis of binomial, trinomial, reciprocal equations, etc., and advanced a great deal in the general equation of degree m, by rigorous methods and admirable ingenuity. This work, which reveals a complete mastery of the most intricate questions of the field of analysis, as well as a rare intuition in the geometric field, is known only to a small number of his friends. One day it will be published and it will then be seen how far he has come in the field of abstract speculation and how much this privileged spirit was capable of.\nIn\n1901\nGaravito published\nBeobachtungen des Cometen\n1901\nâ\n(\nObservations of the comet of\n1901\n)\nin\nAstronomische Nachrichten\nin which he writes:-\nIn the observation of\n6\nMay, the Comet shone in such a way that the tail was clearly perceived in the field of the telescope of the theodolite strongly illuminated by a reflector. The tail was perceived as a single one of uniform thickness with a dark stripe that extended lengthwise from the middle part to the end. Bad weather prevented seeing it again on some nights. On the nights of the\n12\nth and\n16\nth the brightness had diminished so considerably that the illumination of the field of the telescope had to be made just sufficient to be able to perceive the threads at the same time as the nucleus; but observing with the dark sky two tails that formed an angle of\n30\nto\n40\ndegrees were clearly visible.\nAs an Observatory publication,\nEl Cometa de\n1901\nâ\n(\nThe comet of\n1901\n)\nby Garavito was also published. He wrote:-\nThe method used in the observations was imposed by the class of instruments that we could take advantage of, given the low height at which the comet was visible.\nIn\n1902\n, while the civil war was still in progress, the Office of Longitudes was founded with the Observatory as the centre of all its work. Garavito submitted the paper\nLa teorÃ­a racional de las curvas planas y de reverso, sus conexiones posibles con la teorÃ­a de las covariantes e invariantes\nâ\n(\nThe rational theory of plane and inverse curves, its possible connections with the theory of covariants and invariants\n)\nto the third Latin American Scientific Congress that met in Rio de Janeiro in\n1905\n. It was published in volume\n2\nof the\nProceedings\n. The Brazilian mathematician Otto de Alencar e Silva\n(1874\n-\n1912)\ncriticised Garavito's paper in various sessions of the Congress and Garavito answered these criticisms in a paper in the\nAnales de IngenierÃ­a\n. Garavito wrotes:-\nIt is very painful for us to make a critical judgment of the cited memoir, but we are morally obliged to do so having been tacitly challenged by Otto Alencar Silva, as recorded in the minutes of the\n5\nth,\n6\nth,\n7\nth, and\n8\nth sessions of the Congress.\nGaravito continued to publish on mathematical and astronomical topics, particularly on mathematical optics, but, from\n1906\nonwards, he also published essays on political economy and philosophical criticism. His interests in political economy were prompted, no doubt, by the harsh effects of the civil wars on the economy of the country and, as a consequence, on the available funding for science\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nIn\n1909\nGaravito delivered an interesting lecture in Samper Hall in BogotÃ¡, to expose his ideas related to topics of political economy. For a long time, his attention had been fixed on the fluctuations of the exchange rate and on the devaluation of paper money, a devaluation that, due to the frequent and large issues made by the government during the developing situation of the\n1899\nwar, reached limits never seen before. ... Garavito realised, before anyone else in Colombia, that paper money was nothing more than a forced contribution imposed on the country because it was not prepared for a more rational tax regime. He said: \"The belief that currency has an effective and unconventional value had become so ingrained in the spirit of our landowners that many came to believe in the total ruin of the country for this reason, and to speak in gloomy terms of the cancer of paper currency.\"\nIn May\n1910\nHalley\n's comet made a close approach to the Earth, in fact the Earth passed through the tail of the comet. People eagerly anticipated the event while others were frightened and some panicked. Garavito was interviewed by the press, wrote popular and academic articles such as\nEl cometa Halley\n1910\nâ\n(\nHalley's comet  of\n1910\n)\nand tried to demonstrate the unfoundedness of people's apprehensions.\nHe continued to write articles on political economy. For example at the Farmers Congress of\n1911\nhe presented a paper on\nSeguro agrÃ­cola\nâ\n(\nAgricultural insurance\n)\nin which he also analysed the background of the Colombian civil wars. In\n1912\nhe published a booklet that he called the\nEvoluciÃ³n de la distribuciÃ³n de la riqueza y fundamento cientÃ­fico del impuesto\nâ\n(\nEvolution of the distribution of wealth and the scientific basis of taxation\n)\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nThis pamphlet is a fairly complete exposition of the economic foundations that in future ages will support society by the State and for the State.\nIn May\n1916\n, in the\nRevista del Colegio del Rosario\n, he published an essay entitled\nCausa principal de la guerra europea\nâ\n(\nMain causes of the European war\n)\n. He had predicted World War I since\n1909\nand in\n1914\nthe truth of his predictions sadly came true. His essay analysed the causes of the war.\nHe continued his work on light, publishing\nTeorÃ­a de la AberraciÃ³n de la Luz\nâ\n(\nTheory of the aberration of light\n)\n(1912)\n,\nNotas Sobre Ãptica MatemÃ¡tica\nâ\n(\nNotes on mathematical optics\n)\n(1913)\nand\nLa Paradoja de la Ãptica MatemÃ¡tica\nâ\n(\nThe paradox of mathematical optics\n)\n(1916)\n.\nIn\n1905\nAlbert Einstein\npublished what is today called the special theory of relativity and in\n1915\nhe publishedÂ the definitive version of the general theory of relativity. Garavito, however, was reluctant to view space as non-euclidean, publishing\nBancarrota de la ciencia?\nâ\n(\nBankruptcy of science?\n)\n(1917)\nand\nNota sobre las GeometrÃ­as Planas no EuclÃ­deas\nâ\n(\nA note on non-Euclidean plane geometries\n)\n(1918)\n, and he did not accept the theory of relativity. He was certainly not alone in his opposition at this time and he did not live long enough to see the experimental verifications of the theory.\nDue to an illness he had contracted in his youth through spending long hours down a flooded coal mine without proper ventilation, his health began to deteriorate visibly from\n1916\n. In the following year he received a severe blow with the death of his wife on\n25\nMay\n1917\n. For twenty-three years she had supported him through some very difficult times\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nHe could not recover from this loss, so the two years that he survived his wife were nothing but slow agony. He no longer attended the Observatory, the centre of his world for so long; it was almost impossible for him to attend his classes at the Faculty of Engineering; he only rarely left his house, spending long hours in front of the notes in his last years. Many friends visited him in such circumstances and all were amazed at the lucidity of that privileged brain, which did not lose its lucidity until the very night of his death. At that time he had the satisfaction that the Colombian Congress had enacted Law\n128\nof\n1919\n, which ordered the publication of his works and the erection of his bust in the garden of the Observatory. This law, long unfulfilled, was finally carried out in part when his bust was inaugurated on\n20\nAugust\n1945\n. In the early hours of\n11\nMarch\n1920\n, after many days spent in bed suffering unspeakable torture caused by the disease and suffering pecuniary hardships that made it impossible for him to lessen the pain of which he was a victim, he gave his soul to the Creator. He died in the same poverty in which he lived; he never had anything; what was left over he gave to the poor ...\nHe was buried in BogotÃ¡'s central Cemetery. His tomb\n[\n3\n]\n:-\n... has long been the unlikely destination of the superstitious, who believe that it can bring good luck and even wealth. Although Garavito, a man of science, would undoubtedly have rejected the superstition, the belief does have a connection to reality: Garavito is on the\n20\n,\n000\npeso bill. Visitors often left flowers coloured blue, the same as the\n20\n,\n000\npeso bill, and even painted parts of the tomb blue. Recently, the cemetery administration renovated Garavito's tomb, raising it and erasing the messages believers had written to Garavito, asking him for miracles or thanking him for favours received. The cemetery folks also put signs on neighbouring trees reminding visitors that leaving flowers, writing messages, burning incense and other activities were strictly prohibited in the cemetery. Naturally, and thankfully, believers have ignored the warning and the tomb is decorated once again.\nIn his lifetime Garavito received many national and international honours, including honorary membership of the Colombian Society of Engineers, of the Geographical Society of Lima, of the Astronomical Society of France and of the Belgian Astronomical Society.\nThe Julio Garavito Order of Merit in the Degree of Grand Cross, the highest distinction awarded by the national government of Colombia in the field of engineering, was established on\n5\nJanuary\n1965\n, the centenary of the birth of Julio Garavito. On\n27\nAugust\n1970\nthe\nInternational Astronomical Union\nnamed a crater on the far side of the Moon 'Garavito crater'. It lies to the north-northwest of the huge walled plain named '\nPoincarÃ©\n'. On\n24\nApril\n1949\nColombia issued a\n4\nÂ Colombian centavo commemorative stamp in his honour. In\n1996\nthe Banco de la Republica issued theÂ\n20\n,\n000\nColombian Pesos banknote with a portrait of Garavito on the front and on the back side of the note is the crater on the Moon's far side named after Garavito. The banknote was withdrawn from circulation in\n2012\n. See\nTHIS LINK\n.\nThe Julio Garavito Colombian School of Engineering, founded in\n1972\n, is named in his honour. The National University of Colombia's engineering building was remodelled and given Garavito's name in a ceremony on\n21\nNovember\n2014\n. On\n13\nAugust\n1993\n, the District Institute of Culture and Tourism awarded their \"Honour to cultural merit\" Medal to Garavito. The award was received by his great-nephew, Clemente Garavito Baraya, President of the Geographic Society of Colombia,  during the closing ceremony of the Conference on Geography and Astronomy.",
