  "biografia": "Hua Loo-Keng\nor\nHua Luogeng\nwas one of the leading mathematicians of his time and one of the two most eminent Chinese mathematicians of his generation,\nS S Chern\nbeing the other. He spent most of his working life in China during some of that country's most turbulent political upheavals. If many Chinese mathematicians nowadays are making distinguished contributions at the frontiers of science and if mathematics in China enjoys high popularity in public esteem, that is due in large measure to the leadership Hua gave his country, as scholar and teacher, for\n50\nyears.\nHua was born in\n1910\nin Jintan in the southern Jiangsu Province of China. Jintan is now a flourishing town, with a high school named after Hua and a memorial building celebrating his achievements; but in\n1910\nit was little more than a village where Hua's father managed a general store with mixed success. The family was poor throughout Hua's formative years; in addition, he was a frail child afflicted by a succession of illnesses, culminating in typhoid fever that caused paralysis of his left leg; this impeded his movement quite severely for the rest of his life. Fortunately Hua was blessed from the start with a cheerful and optimistic disposition, which stood him in good stead then and during the many trials ahead.\nHua's formal education was brief and, on the face of it, hardly a preparation for an academic career - the first degree he would receive was an honorary doctorate from the University of Nancy in France in\n1980\n; nevertheless, it was of a quality that did help his intellectual development. The Jintan Middle School that opened in\n1922\njust when he had completed elementary school had a well-qualified and demanding mathematics teacher who recognized Hua's talent and nurtured it. In addition, Hua learned early on to make up for the lack of books, and later of scientific literature, by tackling problems directly from first principles, an attitude that he maintained enthusiastically throughout his life and encouraged his students in later years to adopt.\nNext, Hua gained admission to the Chinese Vocational College in Shanghai, and there he distinguished himself by winning a national abacus competition; although tuition fees at the college were low, living costs proved too high for his means and Hua was forced to leave a term before graduating. After failing to find a job in Shanghai, Hua returned home in\n1927\nto help in his father's store. In that same year also, Hua married Xiaoguan Wu; the following year a daughter, Shun, was born and their first son, Jundong, arrived in\n1931\n.\nBy the time Hua returned to Jintan he was already engaged in mathematics and his first publication\nSome Researches on the Theorem of Sturm\n, appeared in the December\n1929\nissue of the Shanghai periodical\nScience\n. In the following year Hua showed in a short note in the same journal that a certain\n1926\npaper claiming to have solved the quintic was fundamentally flawed. Hua's lucid analysis caught the eye of\nXiong Qinglai\nat Tsinghua University in Beijing, and in\n1931\nHua was invited, despite his lack of formal qualification and not without some reservations on the part of several faculty members, to join the mathematics department there. He began as a clerk in the library, and then moved to become an assistant in mathematics; by September\n1932\nhe was an instructor and two years later came promotion to the rank of lecturer. By that time he had published another dozen papers and in some of these one could begin to find intimations of his future interests; thanks to his natural talent and dedication, Hua was now, at the age of\n24\n, a professional mathematician.\nAt this time Quing Hua University was the leading Chinese institution of higher education, and its faculty was in the forefront of the endeavour to bring the country's mathematics and science abreast of knowledge in the West, a formidable task after several hundred years of stagnation. During\n1935\n-\n36\nHadamard\nand\nNorbert Wiener\nvisited the university; Hua eagerly attended the lectures of both and created a good impression.\nWiener\nvisited England soon afterward and spoke of Hua to\nG H Hardy\n. In this way Hua received an invitation to come to Cambridge, England, and he arrived in\n1936\nto spend two fruitful years there. By now he had published widely on questions within the orbit of\nWaring\n's problem\n(\nalso on other topics in diophantine analysis and function theory\n)\nand he was well prepared to take advantage of the stimulating environment of the\nHardy\n-\nLittlewood\nschool, then at the zenith of its fame. Hua lived on a $\n1\n,\n250\nper annum scholarship awarded by the Culture and Education Foundation of China; it is interesting to recall that this foundation derived its funds from reparations paid by China to the United States following wars waged in China by the United States and several other nations in the previous century. The amount of the grant imposed on him a Spartan regime.\nHardy\nassured Hua that he could gain a PhD in two years with ease, but Hua could not afford the registration fee and declined; of course, he gave quite different reasons for his decision.\nDuring the Cambridge period Hua became friendly with\nHarold Davenport\nand\nHans Heilbronn\n, then two young research fellows of Trinity College - one a former student of\nLittlewood\nand the other\nLandau\n's last assistant in GÃ¶ttingen - with whom he shared a deep interest in the\nHardy\n-\nLittlewood\napproach to additive problems akin to\nWaring\n's. They helped to polish the English in several of Hua's papers, which now flowed from his pen at a remarkable rate; more than\n10\nof his papers date from this time, and many of these appeared in due course in the publications of the\nLondon Mathematical Society\n.\nAbout the only easy thing about\nWaring\n's problem is its statement: In\n1770\nWaring\nasserted without proof\n(\nand not in these words\n)\nthat for each integer\nk\nâ¥\n2\nk â¥ 2\nk\nâ¥\n2\nthere exists an integer\ns\n=\ns\n(\nk\n)\ns = s(k)\ns\n=\ns\n(\nk\n)\ndepending only on\nk\nk\nk\nsuch that every positive integer\nN\nN\nN\ncan be expressed in the form\nN\n=\nx\n1\nk\n+\nx\n2\nk\n+\n.\n.\n.\n+\nx\ns\nk\nN = x_{1}^{k} + x_{2}^{k} + ... +x_{s}^{k}\nN\n=\nx\n1\nk\nâ\n+\nx\n2\nk\nâ\n+\n.\n.\n.\n+\nx\ns\nk\nâ\nwhere the\nx\nj\n(\nj\n=\n1\n,\n2\n,\n.\n.\n.\n,\ns\n)\nx_{j}(j = 1, 2, ... , s)\nx\nj\nâ\n(\nj\n=\n1\n,\n2\n,\n.\n.\n.\n,\ns\n)\nare non-negative integers. In that same year\nLagrange\nhad settled the case\nk\n=\n2\nk = 2\nk\n=\n2\nby showing that\ns\n(\n2\n)\n=\n4\ns(2) = 4\ns\n(\n2\n)\n=\n4\n, a best possible result; after that, progress was painfully slow, and it was not until\n1909\nthat\nHilbert\nsolved\nWaring\n's problem in its full generality. His argument rested on the deployment of intricate algebraic identities and yielded rather poor admissible values of\ns\n(\nk\n)\ns(k)\ns\n(\nk\n)\n. In\n1918\nHardy\nand\nRamanujan\nreturned to the case\nk\n=\n2\nk = 2\nk\n=\n2\nin order to determine the number of representations of an integer as the sum of\ns\ns\ns\nsquares by means of\nFourier analysis\n, an approach inspired by their famous work on partitions, and they succeeded. This encouraged\nHardy\nand\nLittlewood\nin\n1920\nto apply a similar method for general\nk\nk\nk\n, and they devised the so-called circle method to tackle the general\nHilbert\n-\nWaring\ntheorem and a host of other additive problems,\nGoldbach\n's problem among them. During the next\n20\nyears the machinery of the circle method came to be regarded about as difficult as anything in the whole of mathematics; even today, after numerous refinements and much progress, the intricacies of the method remain formidable.\nThis is the background against which Hua set to work as a young man, and it is probably fair to say that it is for his contributions in this area that Hua's name will remain best remembered: notably for his seminal work on the estimation of trigonometric sums, singly or on average.\nHua might well have remained in England longer, but home was never far from his thoughts and the Japanese invasion of China in\n1937\ncaused him much anxiety. He left Cambridge in\n1938\nto return to his old university, now as a full professor. However, Quing Hua University was no longer in Beijing; with vast portions of China under Japanese occupation, it had migrated to Kunming, the capital of the southern province of Yunan, where it combined with several other institutions to form the temporary Associated University of the South West. There Hua and his family remained through the World War II years, until\n1945\n, in circumstances of poverty, physical privation, and intellectual isolation. Despite these hardships Hua maintained the level of intensity of his Cambridge period and even exceeded it; by the end of\n1945\nhe had more than\n70\npublications to his name. During this time he studied\nVinogradov\n's seminal method of estimating trigonometric sums and reformulated it, even in sharper form, in what is now known universally as\nVinogradov\n's mean value theorem. This famous result is central to improved versions of the\nHilbert\n-\nWaring\ntheorem, and has important applications to the study of the\nRiemann zeta function\n. Hua wrote up this work in a booklet that was accepted for publication in Russia as early as\n1940\n, but owing to the war, did not appear\n(\nin expanded form\n)\nuntil\n1947\nas a monograph of the\nSteklov\nInstitute.\nHua spent three months in Russia in the spring of\n1946\nat\nVinogradov\n's invitation. Mathematical interaction apart, he was impressed by the organization of scientific activity there, and this experience influenced him when later he reached a position of authority in the new China. In the years ahead, even though Hua's scientific activities branched out in other directions, Hua was always ready to return to\nWaring\n's problem, to number theory in general and especially to questions involving exponential sums; thus as late as\n1959\nhe published an important monograph on\nExponential Sums and Their Applications in Number Theory\nfor the\nEnzyklopÃ¤die der Matematischen Wissenschaften\n. His instinct for what was important and his marvellous command of technique make his papers on number theory even now virtually an index to the major activities in that subject during the first half of the twentieth century.\nIn the closing years of the Kunming period Hua turned his interests to algebra and to analysis, as much as anything for the benefit of his students in the first instance, and soon began to make original contributions in these subjects too. Thus Hua became interested in matrix algebra and wrote several substantial papers on the geometry of matrices. He had been invited to visit the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, but because\nC L Siegel\nwas working there along somewhat similar lines, Hua declined, at first in order to develop his ideas independently. In September\n1946\n, shortly after returning from Russia, Hua did depart for Princeton, bringing with him projects not only in matrix theory but also in functions of several complex variables and in group theory. At this time civil war was raging in China and it was not easy to travel; therefore, the Chinese authorities assigned Hua the rank of general in his passport for the \"convenience of travel.\"\nAccording to his biographer, Hua's \"most significant and rewarding research work\" during his stay in the United States was on the topic of skew fields, that is, on\n(\nnon-commutative\n)\ndivision rings, of which the\nquaternions\nare a classic example.\nThere was much else, of course, to distinguish this last major creative period of his life. Hua wrote several papers with\nH S Vandiver\non the solution of equations in finite fields and with\nI Reiner\non automorphisms of classical groups. Much of his algebraic work later provided the basis for the monograph\nClassical Groups\nby Wan Zhe Xian and Hua\n(\npublished by the Shanghai Scientific Press in Chinese in\n1963)\n.\nOn the personal side, in the spring of\n1947\nHua underwent an operation at the Johns Hopkins University on his lame leg that much improved his gait thereafter, to his and his family's delight. Also in\n1947\ntheir daughter Su was born; two more sons had arrived earlier, Ling and Guang, the latter in\n1945\nand one more daughter, Mi, was born a little later. In the spring of\n1948\nHua accepted appointment as a full professor at the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign. There he directed the thesis of R Ayoub, later a professor at Pennsylvania State University; continued his work with I\nReiner\n; and influenced the thinking of several young research workers, L Schoenfeld and J Mitchell among them. His stay in Illinois was all too brief, exciting developments were taking place in China, and Hua watched them eagerly, wanting to be part of the new epoch. Although he had brought his wife and three younger children to Urbana and they had settled in quite well, the urge to return was too great; on March\n16\n,\n1950\n, he was back in Beijing at his alma mater, Quing Hua University, ready to add his contribution to the brave new world. He was then at the peak of his mathematical powers and, as he wrote to me many years later, the\n1940\ns had been to him in retrospect the golden years of his life. Despite the trials that he would face, he did not at any subsequent time regret his decision to return.\nBack in China, Hua threw himself into educational reform and the organization of mathematical activity at the graduate level, in the schools, and among workers in the burgeoning industry. In July\n1952\nthe Mathematical Institute of the\nAcademia Sinica\ncame into being, with Hua as its first director. The following year he was one of a\n26\n-member delegation from the\nAcademia Sinica\nto visit the Soviet Union in order to establish links with Russian science. At this time Hua entertained doubts whether the Communist Party at home trusted him, and it came as an agreeable surprise to him to learn in Moscow that the Chinese government had agreed to a proposal by the Soviet government to award Hua a Stalin Prize. Following Stalin's death the prize was discontinued, and Hua missed out; in view of later developments, he told me, he had a double reason to be satisfied!\nDespite his many teaching and administrative duties, Hua remained active in research and continued to write, not only on topics that had engaged him before but also in areas that were new to him or had been only lightly touched on before. In\n1956\nhis voluminous text,\nIntroduction to Number Theory\n, appeared.\n(\nThe preface to the\n1975\nChinese edition was excised by government order because Hua was out of favour during much of the Cultural Revolution\n)\n; later this was published by Springer in English translation and is still in print.\nHarmonic Analysis of Functions of Several Complex Variables in the Classical Domains\ncame out in\n1958\nand was translated into Russian in the same year, followed by an English translation by the\nAmerican Mathematical Society\nin\n1963\n.\nIn\n1958\nhe suffered a rude awakening from utopian dreams with the so-called Great Leap Forward, when a Mao-inspired, savage assault on intellectuals swept the country, implemented with enthusiasm by a compliant bureaucracy inspired by Orwellian slogans like:-\n... the lowliest are the smartest, the highest the most stupid.\nDespite his eminence and some protection in high places, Hua had to suffer harassment, public abuse, and constant surveillance. Nevertheless, during this troubled period Hua developed, with Wang Yuan, a broad interest in linear programming, operations research, and multidimensional numerical integration. In connection with the last of these, the study of the Monte Carlo method and the role of uniform distribution led them to invent an alternative deterministic method based on ideas from algebraic number theory. Their theory was set out in\nApplications of Number Theory to Numerical Analysis\n, which was published much later, in\n1978\n, and by Springer in English translation in\n1981\n. The newfound interest in applicable mathematics took him in the\n1960\ns, accompanied by a team of assistants, all over China to show workers of all kinds how to apply their reasoning faculty to the solution of shop-floor and everyday problems. Whether in ad hoc problem-solving sessions in factories or open-air teachings, he touched his audiences with the spirit of mathematics to such an extent that he became a national hero and even earned an unsolicited letter of commendation from Mao, this last a valuable protection in uncertain times. Hua had a commanding presence, a genial personality, and a wonderful way of putting things simply, and the impact of his travels spread his fame and the popularity of mathematics across the land. When much later he travelled abroad, wherever he stayed Chinese communities of all political persuasions flocked to meet him and do him honour; in\n1984\nwhen he organized a conference on functions of several complex variables in Hangzhou, colleagues from the West were astonished by the scale of the publicity accorded it by the Chinese media.\nBut all that was in the future. In\n1966\nMao set in motion the next national calamity, which came to be known as the Cultural Revolution and would last\n10\nyears. A pronouncement of Mao dated as early as June\n26\n,\n1965\n, sent a dire signal of things to come to the intellectuals:-\nThe more you read, the more stupid you become.\nHua spent many of these years under virtual house arrest. He attributed his survival to the personal protection of Chou En-lai. Even so, he was exposed to harassing interrogations, some of his manuscripts\n(\non mathematical economics\n)\nwere confiscated and are now irretrievably lost, and attempts were made to extract from his associates and former students damaging allegations against him.\n(\nIn\n1978\nthe Chinese ambassador to the United Kingdom described one such occasion to me; Chen Jing-run, then probably the best known Chinese mathematician of the next generation, was made to stand in a public place for several hours, surrounded by a mob, and exhorted to bear witness against Hua. Chen, present at this conversation, chimed in to say that, actually, he had quite enjoyed the occasion, since no student could trouble him with silly questions and he had had time, uninterrupted, to think about mathematics!\n)\nIt is surely no accident that the flow of Hua's publications came to an untimely end in\n1965\n. He continued to work, of course. There are several joint papers on numerical analysis\n(\nwith Wang Yuan\n)\nand on optimisation\n(\nwith Ke Xue Tong Bao\n)\nin the\n1970\ns, but these are probably based on work done earlier; there are also expository articles and texts derived from the vast teaching and consulting experience he accumulated over the years. As he would reminisce sadly in a\n1991\narticle:-\nUpon entering\n[\nmy\n]\nsixtieth year ... almost all energy and spirit were taken from me.\nWith the end of the Cultural Revolution in\n1976\nHua entered upon the last period of his life. Honour was restored to him at home, and he became a vice-president of the\nAcademia Sinica\n, a member of the People's Congress and science advisor to his government. In addition, Chinese Television\n(\nCCTV\n)\nproduced a mini-series telling the story of Hua's life, which has been shown at least twice since then. In\n1980\nhe became a cultural ambassador of his country charged with re-establishing links with Western academics, and during the next five years he travelled extensively in Europe, the United States, and Japan. In\n1979\nhe was a visiting research fellow of the then Science Research Council of the United Kingdom at the University of Birmingham and during\n1983\n-\n84\nhe was Sherman Fairchild Distinguished Scholar at the California Institute of Technology. For much of this time he was tired and in poor health, but a characteristic zest for life and a quenchless curiosity never deserted him; to a packed audience in a seminar in Urbana in the spring of\n1984\nhe spoke about mathematical economics. One felt that he was driven to make up for all those lost years. In his last letter to me, dated\n21\nMay\n1985\n, he reported that unfortunately most of his time now was devoted to:-\n... non-mathematical activities, which are necessary for my country and my people.\nHe died of a heart attack at the end of a lecture he gave in Tokyo on\n12\nJune\n1985\n.\nHua received honorary doctorates from the University of Nancy\n(1980)\n, the Chinese University of Hong-Kong\n(1983)\n, and the University of Illinois\n(1984)\n. He was elected a foreign associate of the\nNational Academy of Sciences\n(1982)\nand a member of the\nDeutsche Akademie der Naturforscher Leopoldina\n(1983)\n, Academy of the Third World\n(1983)\n, and the Bavarian Academy of Sciences\n(1985)\n.\nProfessor Wang Yuan has written a fine biography\n[\n1\n]\nof Hua, and I am indebted to it for some of the information I have used. I have also drawn on the obituary notice I wrote for\nActa Arithmetica\n[\n6\n]\n.",
