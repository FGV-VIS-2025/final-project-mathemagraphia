  "biografia": "Luis Caffarelli\n's parents were Luis Caffarelli\n(\nborn\n18\nMarch\n1915\nin Buenos Aires, Argentina\n)\nand Hilda Delia Cespi\n(\nborn\n9\nSeptember\n1922\nin Buenos Aires, Argentina\n)\n. Luis Caffarelli Sr was a mechanical engineer who workedÂ in the shipping industry in the RÃ­o de la Plata bay. Luis and Hilda had three children, Maria Luisa Caffarelli, Luis Ãngel Caffarelli\n(\nthe subject of this biography\n)\nand Alicia Caffarelli. Luis spoke about his early years in the interview\n[\n19\n]\n:-\nWe lived in a nice middle class area of Buenos Aires. At the time when I was a kid I would play soccer a lot with my friends. Another game we enjoyed a lot was to throw a ball, or something else, and see who got it closest to a wall or to a line.\nHe attended the Colegio Nacional de Buenos Aires which began its existence as a Jesuit school in the\n17\nth century. As a National College it dates from\n1863\n, and was incorporated into the University of Buenos Aires in\n1911\n. By the time Caffarelli studied there it had gained an excellent reputation for both Humanities and Sciences. Excellent teachers of mathematics and science led to these topics becoming the subjects he most enjoyed. He graduated from the Colegio Nacional in\n1966\nand entered the University of Buenos Aires in March\n1967\n. He wrote\n[\n12\n]\n:-\nThe military led the country at that time and many of the top scientists were abroad. Still, the remaining faculty and students at the university were very dedicated.\nHe spoke in\n[\n19\n]\nabout his lecturers at the University:-\nAs a student I was heavily influenced and inspired by\nLuis SantalÃ³\n(1911\n-\n2001)\n, Manuel Balanzat\n(1912\n-\n1994)\nand Carlos Segovia\n(1937\n-\n2007)\n.\nSantalÃ³\nand Balanzat were both Spanish mathematicians who moved to Argentina as a consequence of the Spanish Civil War.\nSantalÃ³\nmade important contributions to integral geometry and geometric probability, while Balanzat worked in functional analysis. They built, jointly with\nRey Pastor\n(1888\n-\n1962)\nand Pi Calleja\n(1907\n-\n1986)\n, a superb undergraduate and graduate mathematics programme at the University of Buenos Aires, generating a very strong group in analysis, geometry and algebraic geometry. The harmonic analyst Segovia was a prominent graduate from Universidad de Buenos Aires who did his PhD at the University of Chicago in\n1967\nwith\nAlberto CalderÃ³n\n(1920\n-\n1988)\n. While closer to me in age than\nSantalÃ³\nand Balanzat, Segovia was always a strong support.\nFor about a year and a half he studied both mathematics and physics but finally he chose to concentrate totally on mathematics. He was awarded his Master of Science degree in\n1969\nand continued undertaking research for a Ph.D. degree. He wrote\n[\n15\n]\n:-\nI was trained in the CalderÃ³n school of real analysis and wrote my Ph.D. dissertation and some other articles on summability and conjugation of series of special polynomials.\nWe should say a little about the 'CalderÃ³n school'. There are two half-brothers named CalderÃ³n, namely\nCalixto Pedro CalderÃ³n\nand his much older half-brother\nAlberto Pedro CalderÃ³n\n. Both had the same father, Pedro CalderÃ³n, but after Alberto's mother died, Pedro remarried Matilde Garcia who was\nCalixto\n's mother.\nCalixto\n, born in December\n1939\n, was\n20\nyears younger than\nAlberto CalderÃ³n\n. He was awarded his doctorate in\n1969\nfrom the University of Buenos Aires, only two years before Luis Caffarelli who was his first Ph.D. student. In\n1974\nCalixto CalderÃ³n\nwent to the University of Illinois at Chicago where he worked until he retired in\n2000\n.\nIn\n1971\nCaffarelli submitted his thesis\nSobre conjugaciÃ³n y sumabilidad de series de Jacobi\nâ\n(\nOn conjugation and summability of Jacobi series\n)\nto the University of Buenos Aires and he was awarded a Ph.D. in\n1972\n. He undertook joint research with his thesis advisor\nCalixto Pedro CalderÃ³n\nand they wrote two joint papers:\nWeak type estimates for the Hardy-Littlewood maximal functions\n(1974\n-\n74)\n; and\nOn Abel summability of multiple Jacobi series\n(1974)\n.\nWhile in Buenos Aires he married Irene MartÃ­nez Gamba\n(\nborn\n1957)\nwho is also an exceptional mathematician; they have three children Alejandro Caffarelli, Nicolas Caffarelli and Mauro Caffarelli.\nIn\n1973\n, having been awarded a postdoctoral fellowship, he went to the University of Minnesota to work with Eugene Fabes and\nCalixto CalderÃ³n\n; he remained there until\n1983\n. He said\n[\n56\n]\n:-\nFrom the hot Buenos Aires summer to the Minnesota winter was a dramatic change, but with the generous help of Fabes and Walter Littman I got to love Minneapolis.\nIn\n2009\nCaffarelli spoke about his arrival at the University of Minnesota in\n1973\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nI came to the United States to the University of Minnesota in January of\n1973\n. There was no email, no fax, and even the telephone was very expensive. But I found at Minnesota and in the midwest an extraordinary group of people. My colleagues were extremely generous, dedicated, and friendly, and they taught me much of what I know. They shared their ideas and gave me guidance as I began my research programme.\nAfter the Postdoctoral Fellowship which he held at the University of Minnesota in\n1963\n-\n74\n, he was appointed as an Assistant Professor in\n1975\n, an Associate Professor in\n1977\n, and a full professor in\n1979\n. He wrote in\n[\n15\n]\nabout the research he undertook while at the University of Minnesota attempting to explain his high-powered results to a general audience:-\nShortly after my arrival, I attended a fascinating series of lectures by\nHans Lewy\nand became interested in nonlinear partial differential equations, variations inequalities and free-boundary problems. An elementary example of this type of a problem would be a balloon inside a box\n(\nor a drop inside a cavity\n)\n. If the balloon were suspended freely in the air, a first approximation to its shape would be given by a prescribed mean curvature equation\n(\na mildly non-linear equation\n)\nthat we could deduce from the fact that the balloon tries to minimise the energy of the configuration\n(\nan unconstrained variational problem\n)\n. If constrained to lie inside the box, the surface of the balloon would behave differently when it is free than when it presses against the wall\n(\na strongly nonlinear differential equation\n)\ncreating a separation curve\n(\nthe free boundary\n)\nbetween both regions. In this area, I investigated extensively the mathematical problems associated with solid-liquid interphases, jet and cavitational flows, and gas and liquid flow in a porous media.\nCaffarelli's paperÂ\nSurfaces of minimum capacity for a knot\nÂ was published inÂ\n1975\nÂ but it was the following year that proved a remarkable one for Caffarelli in terms of publications for in that year six of his papers were published:Â\nCertain multiple valued harmonic function\n;Â\nOn the HÃ¶lder continuity of multiple valued harmonic functions\n;Â\nThe regularity of elliptic and parabolic free boundaries\n;Â\n(\nwith NÃ©stor M RiviÃ¨re\n)\nÂ\nOn the rectifiability of domains with finite perimeter\n;Â\n(\nwith NÃ©stor M RiviÃ¨re\n)\nÂ\nSmoothness and analyticity of free boundaries in variational inequalities\n; andÂ\nThe smoothness of the free surface in a filtration problem\n. He continued his remarkable publication record with three papers inÂ\n1977\n, two of which were written jointly with NÃ©stor M RiviÃ¨re, and five papers inÂ\n1978\n, four of which were written jointly with Avner Friedman.\nAlthough Caffarelli continued to hold his professorship at the University of Minnesota until\n1983\n, he spent the two years\n1980\n-\n82\nas a Professor at the\nCourant\nInstitute. This brought about a change in his research interests as he explained in\n[\n15\n]\n:-\nIn\n1980\nI was invited to join the faculty at the\nCourant\nInstitute, where I developed new interests: fluid dynamics and fully nonlinear equations under the advice and in collaboration with\nLouis Nirenberg\n. A standing area of research we pursued was the three-dimensional\nNavier\n-\nStokes\nflows\n(\na model for the evolution of viscous, incompressible fluid flows\n)\nwhere we showed that the speed of the flow could become infinite at most on a set of zero one-dimensional measure\n(\nthat is less than a curve\n)\nin space and in time.\n(\nA nearly optimal result, according to the recent examples of Shefer\n)\n. We also extensively investigated the properties of hypersurfaces in n-dimensional Euclidean space for which elliptic relations among their principal curvatures are prescribed\n(\ni.e. mean curvature equation,\nMonge\n-\nAmpÃ¨re\nequation in real or complex space, etc.\n)\n.\nIn\n1982\nCaffarelli was awarded the\nGuido Stampacchia\nPrize by the Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa\n(\nsee\n[\n62\n]\nfor details\n)\n. This prize was jointly awarded to six mathematicians, Caffarelli and his co-authors, for the series of six papers:\nBrownian Motion and Harnack inequality for SchrÃ¶dinger operators\n;\nExistence and regularity for a minimum problem with free boundary\n;\nAxially symmetric jet flows\n;\nAsymmetric jet flows\n;\nJet flows with gravity\n; and\nAsymptotic behaviour of minimum problems with bilateral obstacles\n. It was the first of many awards and prizes given to Caffarelli.\nIn\n1983\nhe was appointed as a professor at the University of Chicago, a position he held for three years. During these years he continued to receive major awards for his outstanding contributions. In\n1984\nhe was awarded the\nBÃ´cher\nPrize by the\nAmerican Mathematical Society\n[\n44\n]\n:-\n... for his deep and fundamental work in nonlinear partial differential equations, in particular his work on free boundary problems, vortex theory and regularity theory.\nIn\n1986\nCaffarelli left Chicago when he was appointed Professor at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. On\n31\nOctober\n1988\nPope John Paul II presented Caffarelli with the\nPontifical Academy of Sciences\nPius XI Gold Medal. We have quoted several times above from the speech that Caffarelli delivered on that occasion. Let us quote here what he said about his current research interests\n(\nin\n1988)\n[\n15\n]\n:-\nMy current interests include uniform estimates on singular perturbations when approaching a singular limit, for instance for the level surfaces approaching a surface of discontinuity and its implications on the stability of both the surface of discontinuity and numerical methods employed to simulate the limiting problem.\nFor ten years Caffarelli worked at the Institute for Advanced Study, then in\n1994\n, because he missed working with graduate students, he returned to the\nCourant\nInstitute where he spent three years. In\n1997\nhe moved to the University of Texas at Austin where he was appointed to the Sid W Richardson Foundation Regents Chair. Awards continued to acknowledge the extremely high quality of his research contributions. In\n2003\nhe was awarded the Premio Konex, Platino y Brillantes, Argentina\n[\n43\n]\n:-\n... as the most important scientist of his country in the last decade.\nThe\nSwedish Academy of Sciences\nawarded him their Rolf Schock Prize in\n2005\n[\n52\n]\n:-\n... for his important contributions to the theory of nonlinear partial differential equations.\nThe\nAmerican Mathematical Society\nawarded him their Leroy P Steele Prize for Lifetime Achievement in Mathematics in\n2009\n. The citation begins\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nLuis Caffarelli is one of the world's greatest mathematicians studying nonlinear partial differential equations\n(\nPDE\n)\n. This is a difficult field: there are rarely exact formulas for solutions of nonlinear PDEs, and rarely will exact algebraic calculations yield useful expressions. Instead researchers must typically invoke functional analysis to build \"generalised\" solutions for many important equations. What remains is the profound and profoundly technical problem of proving regularity for these weak solutions and, by universal acclaim, the greatest authority on regularity theory is Luis Caffarelli. His breakthroughs are so many, and yet so technical, that they defy any simple recounting here. But it was certainly Caffarelli's work on \"free boundary\" problems that first showed his deep insights. Free boundary problems entail finding not only the solution of some PDEs, but also the very region within which the equation holds. Luis Caffarelli's vast work totally dominates this field, starting with his early papers on the obstacle problem. ...\nIn\n2012\n, he was made a Fellow of the\nAmerican Mathematical Society\n. In the same year Caffarelli received the prestigious Wolf Prize in Mathematics\n[\n23\n]\n:-\n... for his work on partial differential equations.\nHis work leading to the award of the Wolf Prize is described in\n[\n23\n]\n:-\nCafferelli has repeatedly made very deep breakthroughs. His early work on free boundary problems was the first place where his extraordinary talent and intuition began to show. Free boundary problems are about finding the solution to an equation and the region where the equation holds. In a series of pioneering papers, Caffarelli put forward a novel methodology which eventually leads, after several truly amazing technical estimates that step by step improve the regularity of the solutions and the boundary, to full regularity under very mild assumptions. Although the theory is complicated, the arguments are elementary and full of beautiful geometric intuition and mastery of analytic technique. A second fundamental contribution by Caffarelli is the study of fully nonlinear elliptic partial differential equations\n(\nincluding the famous\nMonge\n-\nAmpÃ¨re\nequation\n)\n, which he revolutionised. The upshot is that, although the equations are nonlinear, they behave for purposes of regularity as if they were linear. ... Another fundamental contribution by Caffarelli is his joint work with Kohn and\nNirenberg\non partial regularity of solutions of the incompressible\nNavier\n-\nStokes\nequation in\n3\nspace dimensions. Although the full regularity of solutions is still unknown and likely very hard, Caffarelli-Kohn-\nNirenberg\nshowed that the singular set must have parabolic\nHausdorff\ndimension strictly less than one. In particular, singular fibres cannot occur. ... Caffarelli has also produced deep work on homogenisation and on equations with nonlocal dissipation. The list could be continued. Caffarelli is the world's leading expert on regularity of solutions of partial differential equations.\nIn\n2018\nCafferelli was made a fellow of the\nSociety for Industrial and Applied Mathematics\n(\nSIAM\n)\n. The citation states that\n[\n47\n]\n:-\nLuis Angel Caffarelli, The University of Texas at Austin, is being recognised for seminal contributions in regularity theory of nonlinear partial differential equations, free boundary problems, fully nonlinear equations, and nonlocal diffusion.\nIn the same year of\n2018\nhe was awarded the Shaw Prize in Mathematics by the Hong Kong-based Shaw Foundation\n[\n8\n]\n:-\n... for his ground-breaking work on partial differential equations, including creating a theory of regularity for nonlinear equations such as the\nMonge\n-\nAmpÃ¨re\nequation, and free-boundary problems such as the obstacle problem, work that has influenced a whole generation of researchers in the field.\nThis prize is one of the world's largest mathematics prizes with a monetary value of US$\n1\n.\n2\nmillion.\nCaffarelli has received many honours in addition to those mentioned above. He has been elected to the\nAmerican Academy of Arts and Sciences\n(1986)\n; the\nNational Academy of Sciences\n(1991)\n; the\nPontifical Academy of Sciences\n; the\nArgentina Mathematical Union\n; the\nAccademia Nazionale dei Lincei\n; and several others. He was invited to deliver the\nFermi\nLectures at the Scuola Normale di Pisa\n(1998)\nand was the\nAmerican Mathematical Society\nColloquium Lecturer in\n1993\n. A summary of his research by the\nPontifical Academy of Sciences\nis as follows\n[\n32\n]\n:-\nLuis Caffarelli works in non linear analysis, mainly on non linear partial differential equations arising from geometry and mechanics. He has conducted extensive research into free boundary and singular perturbation problems. He has worked on free boundary problems that arise naturally when a constitutive relation or a conserved quantity\n(\na temperature, a pressure, a density\n)\nchanges discontinuously its behaviour across some value of the variables under consideration. Typical examples are solid-liquid interphases, burnt-unburnt mixtures in flame propagation, and flow in porous media. Understanding of the geometry and stability of the solution and its interphase is important in selecting and evaluating simulation methods, as well as understanding the models themselves. Another area of research is fully non linear equations and optimal transportation. Fully non linear equations arise in optimisation and optimal control. They have also been recently studied in relation to optimal transportation and optimal antenna design. Other areas of interest are incompressible flows, harmonic maps, and minimal surface theory and more recently, on non linear random homogenisation.\nThe\nAbel\nPrize is recognised as the highest possible award to a mathematician. It was presented to Luis Caffarelli in\n2023\n[\n16\n]\n:-\n... for his seminal contributions to regularity theory for nonlinear partial differential equations including free-boundary problems and the\nMonge\n-\nAmpÃ¨re\nequation.\nFor the Press Release, the Citation and other information about the award of this prize to Caffarelli, see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nIn the interview\n[\n57\n]\n,\nLouis Nirenberg\nwas asked, \"What is Caffarelli like as a mathematician?\" He replied:-\nFantastic intuition, just remarkable. We haven't worked together for several years now, but when we worked together, I had a hard time keeping up with him. He somehow immediately sees things that other people don't see, but he has trouble explaining them. He says things and writes very little, so when we were working at the board, I would always say, \"Luis, please write more, write down more.\" Once I said to him, \"Luis, to use a Biblical expression, 'Where is it written?'\" Somebody said he once heard a talk in which Luis proved something in partial differential equations - using nothing! Just somehow out of thin air, he can come up with ideas. He's really fantastic - and a very nice person.\nBoth the quantity and quality of Caffarelli's work is astounding. We give data up to the end of September\n2023\n. MathSciNet lists\n322\npublications by Caffarelli, three of which appeared in\n2022\nand one in\n2023\n. These papers have\n20\n,\n200\ncitations in\n11\n,\n499\npublications by\n7\n,\n236\ndistinct authors. He has advised more than\n30\nPhD students. While giving this data, we note that his wife, Irene MartÃ­nez Gamba, had\n99\npublications listed in MathSciNet with the earliest publication being in\n1986\n. These\n99\npapers have\n1\n,\n715\ncitations in\n954\npublications by\n975\nby distinct authors. Her Ph.D. was from the University of Chicago in\n1989\nwith the thesis\nAsymptotic behavior at the boundary of a semiconductor device in two space dimensions\n. She holds the W A Tex Moncrief, Jr. Chair in Computational Engineering and Sciences III at the University of Texas.\nGiven Caffarelli's incredible output of mathematics it is hard to see how he has much time for hobbies. When asked about these in the interview\n[\n19\n]\nhe said:-\nI like to cook, but my wife is a better chef than I am. I also like to play some soccer if I have time. I play the piano. I prefer mostly classical music.\nLet us end with a quote by Caffarelli from\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nThrough the years, I have had the opportunity to belong to wonderful institutions and to befriend and collaborate with extraordinary scientists all over the world. This led to further opportunities to mentor very talented young people who have invigorated my research with new ideas.",
