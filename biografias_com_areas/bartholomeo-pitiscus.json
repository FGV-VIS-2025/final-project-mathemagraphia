  "biografia": "Bartholomeo Pitiscus\nwas born into a poor family, no further details of which are known. He studied theology, first at Zerbst, then at Heidelberg. He was a Calvinist, studying Calvinist theology, and he remained a staunch proponent of this form of Christianity throughout his life.\nPitiscus's future was much tied to Friedrich der Aufrichtige, known as Frederick IV, elector of the Palatine of the Rhine. Frederick's father died in\n1583\nand John Casimir, his uncle, became guardian to the ten year old Frederick. John Casimir was an ardent Calvinist and appointed Pitiscus to teach Frederick in\n1584\n. Later Pitiscus was appointed court chaplain at Breslau and court preacher to Frederick IV. When John Casimir died in\n1592\n, Frederick undertook the government of the Palatinate continuing his uncle's policies of hostility to the Catholic Church. Pitiscus strongly supported the Calvinist policies from a major position of influence. On\n8\nApril\n1603\nPitiscus was appointed professor of mathematics at the University of Heidelberg, succeeding Valentinus Otho who had been a pupil of\nRheticus\n(\nsee\n[\n6\n]\n)\n.\nH L L Bustard writes in\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nAlthough Pitiscus worked much in the theological field, his proper abilities concerned mathematics, and particularly trigonometry.\nThe word 'trigonometry' is due to Pitiscus and first occurs in the title of his work\nTrigonometria: sive de solutione triangulorum tractatus brevis et perspicuus\nfirst published in Heidelberg in\n1595\nas the final section of A Scultetus's\nSphaericorum libri tres methodicÃ© conscripti et utilibus scholiis expositi\n. In\n1600\na revised version of Pitiscus's work was published in Augsburg as\nTrigonometriae sive de dimensione triangulorum libri quinque\n. This work is in three sections.\nThe first section, divided into five books, covers plane and spherical trigonometry. In the first book he introduced the main definitions and theorems of plane and spherical trigonometry. In the second book he defined the six trigonometric functions, gave results concerning which properties of a triangle must be known in order to solve it using these trigonometric functions, and also gave techniques to construct tables of the functions. For example he shows how to construct sine tables based on a knowledge of the values of sin\n45\nÂ°, sin\n30\nÂ°, and sin\n18\nÂ°. The third of the five books is devoted to plane trigonometry and it consists of six fundamental theorems. Perhaps we should note that Pitiscus actually calls these 'axioms' rather than 'theorems' but they are theorems in the usual sense given with proofs. The fourth book consists of four fundamental theorems on spherical trigonometry, while the fifth book proves a number of propositions on the trigonometric functions.\nThe second section of the\n1600\nwork consists of tables for all six trigonometric functions. This section has the title\nCanon triangulorum sive tabulae sinuum, tangentium et secantium ad partes radii\n100000\n(\nA canon of triangles: or, the tables, of sines, tangents, and secants, the radius assumed to be\n100000)\n. The tables give the values to five or six decimal places. The third section of the work contains ten books discussing\n[\n1\n]\n:-\n... problems of geodesy, measuring of heights, geography, gnomometry, and astronomy.\nIt was translated into English by Ralph Handson and published in\n1614\n, and into French in\n1619\n. A second edition of the English publication appeared in\n1630\n, with a third edition in\n1642\n. This edition is described as follows:-\nTrigonometry: or, the doctrine of triangles. First written in Latin, by Bartholomew Pitiscus of Grunberg in Silesia, and now translated into English by Ralph Handson. Whereunto is added\n(\nfor the mariners use\n)\ncertain nautical questions, together with the finding of the variation of the compass. All performed arithmetically, without map, sphere, globe, or astrolabe, by the said Ralph Handson, London ...\n[\nBound with, as issued:\n]\nA canon of triangles: or, the tables, of sines, tangents, and secants, the radius assumed to be\n100000\n.\nPitiscus was not the first to publish tables of all six trigonometric functions.\nRheticus\n, with the help of six assistants who were funded by Emperor Maximilian II, had computed tables of all these six functions in\nOpus Palatinum de triangulis\nwhich was completed and published in\n1596\nby Valentinus Otho many years after\nRheticus\n's death\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nShortly after the Opus Palatinum was published, it was found that the tangents and secants near the end of the quadrant were very inaccurate. Pitiscus was engaged to correct the tables.\nFirst Pitiscus had to find a manuscript copy of\nRheticus\n's tables which he did after the death of Valentinus Otho\n(\nin\n1603)\n. He recomputed all the tangents and secants between\n83\nÂ° and\n90\nÂ° to eleven decimal places and\n86\npages of\nOpus Palatinum de triangulis\nwas reprinted incorporating Pitiscus's corrections. A new edition, with new title page, was reissued in\n1607\n. Pitiscus then began to work on a new project incorporating his own work with that of\nRheticus\n. The\nThesaurus mathematicus\nwas eventually published in\n1613\nand contained a table of sines by\nRheticus\ncalculated for every\n10\n'' to fifteen decimal places; a calculation of the sine at\n1\n'' intervals for the first and last degree of the quadrant, again by\nRheticus\nto fifteen decimal places; values for the basic sines from which the others were calculated to\n22\ndecimal places by Pitiscus; and sines to\n22\ndecimal places by Pitiscus for each tenth, thirtieth, and fiftieth second in the first\n35\nminutes.",
