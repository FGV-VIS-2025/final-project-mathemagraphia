  "biografia": "Aleksandr Osipovich Gelfond\n's father was Osip Isaacovich Gelfond who was a physician who also had an interest in philosophy. Gelfond entered Faculty of Physics and Mathematics at Moscow State University in\n1924\nand completed his undergraduate studies in\n1927\n. He then began research under the supervision of\nAleksandr Khinchin\nand\nVyacheslaw Stepanov\nand completed his postgraduate studies in\n1930\n.\nDuring\n1929\n-\n30\nhe taught mathematics at Moscow Technological College but already he had published some important papers:\nThe arithmetic properties of entire functions\n(1929)\n;\nTranscendental numbers\n(1929)\n; and\nAn outline of the history and the present state of the theory of transcendental numbers\n(1930)\n. The second of these\n1929\npapers contained the lecture which Gelfond gave to the First All-Union Mathematics Congress held in Kharkov in\n1930\n. These papers by Gelfond represent a major step forward in the study of\ntranscendental numbers\n. The first of the papers examines the growth of an\nentire function\nwhich assumes integer values for integer arguments. In the second of the\n1929\npapers Gelfond applied this result to prove that certain numbers are transcendental, so solving a special case of\nHilbert\n's Seventh Problem. We explain some of these ideas below.\nIn\n[\n5\n]\nGelfond describes the four month visit which he made in\n1930\nto Germany where he spent time at both Berlin and GÃ¶ttingen. He was particularly influenced by\nHilbert\n,\nSiegel\nand\nLandau\nduring his visit. After his return to Russia, Gelfond taught mathematics from\n1931\nat Moscow State University where he held chairs of analysis,\ntheory of numbers\nand the history of mathematics. From\n1933\nhe also worked in the Mathematical Institute of the\nRussian Academy of Sciences\n.\nGelfond developed basic techniques in the study of transcendental numbers, that is numbers that are not the solution of an algebraic equation with\nrational\ncoefficients. In addition to his important work in the number theory of transcendental numbers, Gelfond made significant contributions to the theory of interpolation and the approximation of functions of a complex variable. He also contributed to the study of differential and\nintegral equations\nand to the history of mathematics.\nReturning to Gelfond's contributions to transcendental numbers which we mentioned above, in\n1929\nhe conjectured that:-\nIf\na\nm\n,\n1\nâ¤\nm\nâ¤\nn\na_{m}, 1 â¤ m â¤ n\na\nm\nâ\n,\n1\nâ¤\nm\nâ¤\nn\nand\nb\nm\n,\n1\nâ¤\nm\nâ¤\nn\nb_{m},1 â¤ m â¤ n\nb\nm\nâ\n,\n1\nâ¤\nm\nâ¤\nn\nare\nalgebraic numbers\nsuch that\n{\nln\nâ¡\n(\na\nm\n)\n,\n1\nâ¤\nm\nâ¤\nn\n}\n\\{ \\ln(a_{m}), 1 â¤ m â¤ n \\}\n{\nln\n(\na\nm\nâ\n)\n,\n1\nâ¤\nm\nâ¤\nn\n}\nare linearly independent over\nQ\n\\mathbb{Q}\nQ\n, then\nb\n1\nln\nâ¡\n(\na\n1\n)\n+\nb\nln\nâ¡\n(\na\n)\n+\n.\n.\n.\n+\nb\nn\nln\nâ¡\n(\na\nn\n)\nâ\n0\nb_{1} \\ln (a_{1}) + b \\ln (a) + ... + b_{n} \\ln (a_{n}) â  0\nb\n1\nâ\nln\n(\na\n1\nâ\n)\n+\nb\nln\n(\na\n)\n+\n.\n.\n.\n+\nb\nn\nâ\nln\n(\na\nn\nâ\n)\nî\nâ\n=\n0\n.\nIn\n1934\nhe proved a special case of his conjecture namely that\na\nx\na^{x}\na\nx\nis transcendental if\na\na\na\nis algebraic\n(\na\nâ\n0\n,\n1\na â  0,1\na\nî\nâ\n=\n0\n,\n1\n)\nand\nx\nx\nx\nis an\nirrational\nalgebraic number. This result is now known as Gelfond's theorem and solved Problem\n7\nof the list of\nHilbert\nproblems. It was solved independently by\nSchneider\n.\n(\nIn\n1966\nAlan Baker\nproved Gelfond's Conjecture in general.\n)\nGelfond's papers in\n1933\nand\n1934\n, which include his remarkable achievement, are:\nGram determinants for stationary series\n(\nwritten jointly with\nKhinchin\n)\n(1933)\n;\nA necessary and sufficient criterion for the transcendence of a number\n(1933)\n;\nFunctions that take integer values at the points of a geometric progression\n(1933)\n;\nOn the seventh problem of D Hilbert\n(1934)\n; and\nOn the seventh problem of Hilbert\n(1934)\n. Gelfond addressed the Second All-Union Mathematics Congress in Leningrad in\n1934)\non\nTranscendental numbers\n.\nWe now look briefly at a number of books which Gelfond wrote. Some are research monographs, while others are written at undergraduate, or even high school, level. His major contributions to transcendental numbers is set out in\nTranscendentnye algebraicheskie chisla\nâ\n(\nTranscendental and algebraic numbers\n)\n(1952)\n. In it Gelfond states that his aims are:-\n.\n.. to show the contemporary state of the theory of transcendental numbers, to exhibit the fundamental methods of this theory, to present the historical course of development of these methods, and to show the connections which exist between this theory and other problems in the theory of numbers\n.\nMany of his contributions to approximation and interpolation theories are recounted in\nIschislenie konechnykh raznostey\nâ\n(\nThe calculus of finite differences\n)\n(1952)\n. This was based on a text of the same title which Gelfond originally published in\n1936\n. The\n1936\nbook had been updated over the years before being rewritten for the\n1952\nedition. Danskin, in a review, writes:-\nThis book is very much in the spirit of the modern Russian school concerned with the so-called constructive theory of functions, approximative methods for the solution of differential equations, and so forth. The book is a valuable collection of results in these directions. The exposition is excellent.\nAlso in\n1952\nGelfond published the low level\nSolving equations in integers\nwhich was translated into English in\n1960\n. In this Gelfond states:-\nThis booklet is accessible to the more advanced high school students, ... , to teachers of mathematics, and to engineers.\nIn\n1962\nGelfond published the book\nElementary methods in the analytic theory of numbers\nwritten jointly with\nLinnik\n.\nIngham\nwrites:-\nThe book covers a great variety of topics in number theory, and the unifying feature is that all are treated by methods conventionally called elementary. In broad terms this means that problems are attacked by direct methods within the framework of the problems themselves, without the use of extraneous disciplines such as the theory of functions of a complex variable, Fourier analysis, trigonometric sums.\nIt is worth noting that although this book does not use advanced techniques, nevertheless it is not an easy book to read since the arguments are often involved and highly complex.\nA further text by Gelfond is\nResidues and their applications\n(1966)\n. The chapter titles of this book are: Residues; Singular points and series representations of a function; Expansion of a function in a series and properties of the gamma function; Some functional identities and asymptotic estimates; and Laplace transformation and some problems which are solved by the use of residue theory.\nThe authors of\n[\n4\n]\n(\nin the translation\n[\n5\n]\n)\ntell us something about Gelfond as a mathematician:-\nHis mathematical ability was esteemed, above all, for its originality. Many eminent mathematicians think roughly along the same lines as less eminent ones, though more rapidly and in a more organised way; Gelfond always thought in his own way, one that was unconventional and quite original. For this reason, his outstanding work was for a long time in subjects in which there had been intensive research.\nThe authors of\n[\n4\n]\nalso write about Gelfond as a teacher of mathematics:-\nGelfond devoted much time and effort to training of young scholars, with tact, kindness, and a sincere sensitivity, being remarkably individualistic himself, he valued and respected individuality in his pupils. Without restricting their views and tastes, he knew how to pass on to them his own devotion to science.\nAs to his interests outside cutting edge mathematical research\n[\n5\n]\n:-\n... he was an expert\n(\nof professional standard or almost professional standard\n)\nat chess, literature, mineralogy and the history of science. He was an exceptionally good companion, and easily won the friendship and confidence of people of very different kinds.",
