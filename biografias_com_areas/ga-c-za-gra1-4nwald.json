  "biografia": "GÃ©za GrÃ¼nwald\nwas the son of Ãrmin GrÃ¼nwald\n(1881\n-\n1943)\nand Katalin Sommer who were Jewish. GÃ©za had a brother Gyula GrÃ¼nwald, born in Pestszenterzsebet, a suburb of Budapest, in\n1912\n. Ãrmin GrÃ¼nwald was a house painter who tried hard to educate his sons but struggled to bring in a sufficient income. He did, however, send his two sons to an excellent school. GÃ©za attended the St Stephen's Gymnasium in Budapest where he was taught mathematics by Lajos ErdÅs, the father of\nPaul ErdÅs\n. One of the pupils at St Stephen's Gymnasium was\nPaul ErdÅs\nand the two, both with a passion for mathematics, quickly became friends. Lajos ErdÅs realised that his pupil GÃ©za was very talented and he also realised that his family were not really able to financially support their son's education at this school. Lajos supported GÃ©za both with encouragement and with financial support.\nBefore we go any further we need to clear up a potential difficulty. There were two mathematicians in Budapest in the\n1930\ns who were both named GrÃ¼nwald, namely Tibor GrÃ¼nwald and GÃ©za GrÃ¼nwald, the subject of this biography, but they were not related. Both published papers in the\n1930\ns, both even have joint papers with\nPaul ErdÅs\n, and they were both members of the same group of young Jewish mathematicians meeting together in Budapest. Our archive also contains a biography of Tibor GrÃ¼nwald but he is listed under the name\nTibor Gallai\nwhich he adopted during World War II.\nGÃ©za GrÃ¼nwald and\nPaul ErdÅs\n, who was about\n30\nmonths younger than GÃ©za, used to walk a great deal in VÃ¡rosliget public park surrounding Hero's Square close to the city centre of Budapest. It was, and still is, one of the city's most popular public parks where many people go to relax and enjoy the sun. It contained a zoo and botanical gardens but GÃ©za and Paul spent most of the time they were in the park trying to outdo each other in mental challenges and trying to beat each other in chess. GrÃ¼nwald was an exceptionally talented chess player.\nWhile still at the High School in\n1927\n, GrÃ¼nwald contracted tuberculosis. This was a serious disease and in the\n1920\ns around\n50\n% of those who entered sanatoria with the disease died within five years of contracting it. There was a large difference, however, depending on the sanatorium that the patient went to, with those having a much better chance of a complete cure if it was an expensive sanatorium which offered top quality care and medical attention. GrÃ¼nwald's parents were not in a financial position to give him this type of sanatorium but Lajos ErdÅs offered the necessary financial support and GrÃ¼nwald spent a whole year in a sanatorium, making a complete recovery.\nGrÃ¼nwald should have taken his final school examinations in\n1928\nbut, of course, his illness and the year spent in the sanatorium meant this was not possible. After his recovery he sat his final school examinations in\n1929\nbut, because of the disruption to his schooling, he did not gain one of the top places as would have been expected had his schooling been unaffected. Since GrÃ¼nwald was Jewish, the fact that his school examinations were not outstanding meant big problems in obtaining a university place. We should explain why being Jewish led to this problem. In\n1919\nthere was a Communist take-over of Hungary. A right wing government took over in\n1920\nand there was a rise of anti-Semitism with Jews attacked in the streets. In fact the anti-Semitism was written into law in\n1920\nwith universities only allowed to have\n5\n% of their students being Jewish. GrÃ¼nwald's examination results were not good enough for him to obtain a university place in Hungary with these severe restrictions.\nIf he could not have a university education in Hungary, then he thought he might be able to gain admission to an Italian university. There were financial problems to this idea which had no easy solution. Again it was Lajos ErdÅs who came to the rescue. He approached\nAlfrÃ©d Haar\nwho was the professor of mathematics at the University of Szeged and explained to\nHaar\nthat GrÃ¼nwald was an outstanding mathematician yet unable to gain admission to university. Let us spend a moment explaining how the University of Szeged had been created not long before this time.\nHaar\nhad been appointed to the Franz Josef Royal Hungarian University in KolozsvÃ¡r in\n1912\nand become a full professor there in\n1917\n. Austro-Hungary was aligned to the Central Powers and during the first three years of World War I. In\n1921\nthe Treaty of Trianon was signed which treated Hungary very severely. Its territory was reduced to only one third of its previous size. The terms of the Treaty meant that KolozsvÃ¡r was no longer in Hungary\n(\nit became part of Romania\n)\n, so the University there had to move within Hungarian borders. At first it was sited in Budapest for a temporary period of two years before it moved to Szeged, where there had previously been no university. The Department of Mathematics, consisting of the Mathematical Seminary and the Institute of Descriptive Geometry, began operating in Szeged. The department consisted ofÂ\nFrigyes Riesz\n,\nAlfrÃ©d Haar\n, Rudolf Ortvay\n(\nwho held the Chair of Mathematical Physics\n)\n, andÂ\nTibor RadÃ³\nÂ who had been appointed as\nHaar\n's assistant. Following Lajos ErdÅs's recommendation,\nHaar\ninvited GrÃ¼nwald for an interview which went very well and he was accepted into the University of Szeged's mathematics programme.\nAlexander Soifer writes in\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nIn the early\n1930\ns Budapest, a group of young Jewish students regularly met in a park or took excursions to the countryside to discuss mathematics. ... the regular members of this remarkable group\n[\nwere\n]\n:\nPaul\n(\nPal\n)\nErdÅs\n,\nTibor GrÃ¼nwald\n(\nlater Gallai\n)\n, GergÅr\n(\nGÃ©za\n)\nGrÃ¼nwald, Ester Klein,\nGyÃ¶rgy\n(\nGeorge\n)\nSzekeres\n, Lily SzÃ©kely\n(\nlater Sag\n)\n,\nPaul\n(\nPal\n)\nTurÃ¡n\n, Endre VÃ¡zsonyi, and Marta Wachsberger\n(\nlater Sved\n)\n.\nThis group met at the Anonymous Statue and called themselves the 'Anonymous Circle'. The mathematical discussions which went on within this Circle were perhaps more significant in GrÃ¼nwald's mathematical training than his studies at Szeged.\nPaul TurÃ¡n\nwrites\n[\n6\n]\n:-\nGrÃ¼nwald's mathematical interests were wide-ranging. He used to talk about his experiences in Szeged to his friends in Budapest with much enthusiasm. ... Our group of young researchers in Budapest learned of and studied approximation theory through the works ofÂ\nLeopold FejÃ©r\n. GrÃ¼nwald regularly attended our weekly meetings which we held near the statue ofÂ AnonymousÂ in the city park. There was no equivalent opportunity in Szeged so that it was natural that GrÃ¼nwald became interested in issues discussed in our group.\nGrÃ¼nwald's career at Szeged was highly successful. Beginning with his second year, he won a university prize in each of four consecutive years. In his final undergraduate year he did a project on interpolation and this earned him a university prize. He continued to undertake research on interpolation, advised by\nFrigyes Riesz\n, and submitted his doctoral thesis entitled\nDivergence phenomena of Lagrange interpolating polynomials\n(\nHungarian\n)\n. He defended his thesis on\n4\nDecember\n1935\nand was awarded a doctorate. The\n22\n-page thesis was published in\n1935\nin Hungarian. He published two papers in German, namely\nÃber Divergenzerscheinungen der Lagrangeschen Interpolationspolynome\nâ\n(\nOn divergence phenomena of the Lagrange interpolation polynomials\n)\n(1935)\nand\nÃber Divergenzerscheinungen der Lagrangeschen Interpolationspolynome stetiger Funktionen\nâ\n(\nOn the divergence phenomena of the Lagrange interpolation polynomials for continuous functions\n)\n(1936)\n. He remained at Szeged to gain a teaching qualification and he was awarded a diploma to teach mathematics and physics in September\n1936\n.\nZoltÃ¡n Lajos BayÂ\n(1900\n-\n1992)\nwas appointed professor ofÂ theoretical physics at theÂ University of Szeged in\n1930\n. He was a physicist and engineer who developed various technologies. As well as being professor ofÂ theoretical physics at Szeged, ZoltÃ¡n Bay took over the role of head of the research laboratory of the EgyesÃ¼lt IzzÃ³\n(\nUnited Incandescent Lamp and Electricity Co.\n)\nfactory in\n1936\n. The research laboratory of this electricity company was in Budapest and in September\n1937\nGrÃ¼nwald was employed by ZoltÃ¡n Bay as a mathematician in the research laboratory.\nOn\n22\nMay\n1938\nGrÃ¼nwald married Anna SzilÃ¡gyi who had been born in Miskolc, Hungary, in\n1911\n. Anna, who had been a school friend of GrÃ¼nwald's, was the daughter of Adolf SzilÃ¡gyi and Ilona KÃ¡lmÃ¡n. They lived at Szondi utca\n95\n, Budapest, very close to the entrance to the VÃ¡rosliget public park. Anna and GÃ©za GrÃ¼nwald had one child, a daughter Eva GrÃ¼nwald born in Budapest in\n1939\n. Eva and her mother Anna are both listed in\n[\n2\n]\nas Holocaust Survivors while GÃ©za GrÃ¼nwald and his brother Gyula did not survive.\nGrÃ¼nwald published\n18\npapers in his short life before he was murdered in\n1942\nor\n1943\n. His papers are in Hungarian, German and English. We list these papers at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nToday GrÃ¼nwald is best known for the GrÃ¼nwald-\nMarcinkiewicz\nTheorem. LÃ¡slÃ³ Szili and PÃ©ter VÃ©eresi write in the Preface to\n[\n5\n]\n:-\nIn\n1910\n, exactly hundred years ago, two outstanding mathematicians were born:\n(\nin alphabetical order\n)\nthe Hungarian GÃ©za GrÃ¼nwald and the Polish\nJÃ³zef Marcinkiewicz\n. But we must note some other similarities. They proved in the same year\n(1935)\nthe first version of their famous result\n(\nas today called\n)\nthe GrÃ¼nwald-\nMarcinkiewicz\nTheorem\n(\nG-M Theorem, for short\n)\n. Both improved this first version and got the final form already in the next year; the theorem was a part of their PhD dissertations. And, finally, both were killed during the second world war: GÃ©za GrÃ¼nwald became a holocaust victim in\n1942\nwhile\nJÃ³zef Marcinkiewicz\ndied in\n1940\nin the Katyn massacre.\nThe GrÃ¼nwald-\nMarcinkiewicz\nTheorem shows thatÂ\nLagrange\ninterpolation based at the zeros of\nChebyshev\npolynomials can diverge everywhere even for continuous functions.\nNow we come to GrÃ¼nwald's death and must say straight away that its date is unclear. The above quote give\n1942\n, other sources give\n1943\n, but we will look below at the evidence and explain why we have given\n16\nSeptember\n1942\n. Here is\nPaul TurÃ¡n\n's account\n[\n6\n]\n(\nsee also\n[\n4\n]\n)\n:-\nI\n[\nPaul TurÃ¡n\n]\nbegan writing about GÃ©za GrÃ¼nwald in\n1943\n, a little while after I found out that he had died. It was hard to believe that it was at the April\n1942\n, meeting of the\nBolyai Mathematical Society\nwhen we last met. At the end of that meeting, GÃ©za told me that he was called up for active military duty in the Labour Service Battalions. Young people are shocked when facing death, they can hardly believe in it. I felt just like that and kept hoping that there must have been an error or a misunderstanding, and, in the end, I stopped writing. During the liberation of Budapest in\n1945\n, we all became personally acquainted with death. As time went by, the facts started to come out. We learned that the Hungarian Labour Service Battalion he served in was in fact a \"death unit\" made up of completely innocent \"politically unreliable\" people as punishment for an act of sabotage in the city of GyÃ¶r. Within a few months the entire Battalion was executed except for five lucky survivors, among whom was Mr IstvÃ¡n Kossa who was a good friend of GrÃ¼nwald and who stayed with him until his execution According to Kossa and the official paperwork, GrÃ¼nwald died on\n7\nSeptember\n1943\n, at the age of\n31\n.\nIstvÃ¡n Kossa\n(1904\n-\n1965)\nwas elected Secretary General of the Hungarian Social Democratic Party in\n1933\nand served as secretary to the United Incandescent Lamp and Electricity Company where GrÃ¼nwald worked. Kossa was drafted into the same Labour Service Battalion as GrÃ¼nwald and describes his experiences in\n[\n1\n]\nwhere he writes:-\nDr GÃ©za GrÃ¼nwald, a mathematician at the United Bulb, a good comrade who kept close contact with us but has a weak physique.\nAfter World War II, IstvÃ¡n Kossa became a Hungarian politician and twice served as Minister of Finance.\nAn IstvÃ¡n Kossa biography states he escaped the Service Battalion in January\n1943\nwhich contradicts the statement that he was with GrÃ¼nwald until his death on\n7\nSeptember\n1943\n. The date we have given for GrÃ¼nwald's death is\n16\nSeptember\n1942\nand this is the date given in the Holocaust Survivors and Victims Database\n[\n3\n]\n. The Database states that he was buried on the same day. We note that the Database also shows that GrÃ¼nwald's brother Gyula also died after being drafted into a Hungarian Labour Service Battalion after being captured. The Database gives \"Date Missing: January\n1943\n.\"\nThe\nJÃ¡nos Bolyai Mathematical Society\nestablished the GÃ©za GrÃ¼nwald Memorial Prize in\n1951\n. It is awarded annually to exceptional young mathematicians\n(\nup to a maximum of four per year\n)\nwho have made successful starts to their research careers. See\n[8]\nfor details. Some sources state that it was first awarded in\n1953\nby we have found that Lajos TakÃ¡cs won the second GÃ©za GrÃ¼nwald Memorial Prize in\n1952\nfor his paper\nInvestigation of waiting time problems by reduction to Markov processes\n.",
