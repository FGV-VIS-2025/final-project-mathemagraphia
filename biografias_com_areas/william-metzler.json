  "biografia": "William Metzler\nwas educated at the University of Toronto, where he was a pupil of the algebraist Henry S Taber, from\n1886\nto\n1892\n. He graduated with an A.B. in\n1888\nand continued to undertake research in mathematics. He was awarded a Ph.D. by Clark University, Worcester, Massachusetts in\n1892\nfor his thesis\nOn the Roots of Matrices\nwritten with William Story and Henry Taber as advisors.\nMetzler was appointed to Syracuse University, New York, where he became a professor in\n1895\n. He held this post until\n1923\nbut during this period he also served as Dean of the Graduate School at Syracuse. In\n1923\nhe moved to the New York State College of Teachers at Albany, New York, where he served as Professor of Mathematics and Dean for ten years until\n1933\n. Erik Hemmingsen, writing about the Department of Mathematics at Syracuse University, mentions Metzler's contributions:-\nIn the early\n1900\n's and up through the\n1920\n's, the Liberal Arts Department of Mathematics had some real quality. William Henry Metzler, for instance, had found a proof of a conjecture about the relation between the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of a square matrix and the\ndeterminants\nof some of its minors. Furthermore, he was the one who first pointed out that one could have the transcendental functions of a square matrix simply by substituting it into the appropriate Taylor series.\nWe list a few of Metzler's papers:\nHomogeneous strains\n(1893)\n;\nOn certain aggregates of determinant minors\n(1901)\n;\nOn the rank of a matrix\n(1913)\n;\nOn the expression of certain minors of the lth compound of a determinant as a function of the elements of a single line of the mth compound\n(1913)\n;\nSome relations between compound determinants\n(1925)\n;\nOn an expression of a minor of order two of the Mth compound of a determinant A in terms of minors of A of order higher than M\n(1925)\n;\nOn certain determinant relations\n(1926)\n.\nIn June\n1918\nMetzler joined the\nEdinburgh Mathematical Society\nand remained a member of the Society throughout his career. He was elected to the\nRoyal Society of Edinburgh\non\n3\nMarch\n1902\n, his proposers being D H Marshall, R M Wenley, John George Adami, James Douglas Hamilton Dickson.\nAn obituary, written by\nA C Aitken\n, appears in the\nRoyal Society of Edinburgh\nYear Book\n1946\n, page\n34\n.\nWe give a version of this obituary at\nTHIS LINK\nHe was awarded a D.Sc. by Syracuse University in\n1931\n.",
