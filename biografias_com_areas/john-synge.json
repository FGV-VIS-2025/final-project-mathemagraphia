  "biografia": "John Synge\n's father Edward Synge could trace his family back to the fifteenth century. The origin of the name \"Synge\" is described in the introduction to\nGeneral relativity : papers in honour of J L Synge\n:-\nThe name Synge is said to have originated with Henry VIII, who commanded a favourite choirboy to \"Synge, Millington, synge\".\nJohn Synge's mother, Ellen Price, was of Scottish origin, being descended from the Scottish Stuarts, in particular a Sir William Stuart who went to Ireland in the early seventeenth century.\nAfter being educated at St Andrews College in Dublin, Synge entered Trinity College, Dublin in\n1915\n. There his achievements were quite remarkable, winning a Foundation Scholarship at the end of his first year. This scholarship was normally won by students in their third year of study. He was awarded his B.A. in\n1919\nin Mathematics and Experimental Physics. He received the Large Gold Medal for his outstanding work.\nAfter graduating, Synge was appointed to a lectureship in mathematics at Trinity College, but he only held the post for a short time, leaving for Canada in\n1920\n. from\n1920\nto\n1925\nSynge was an assistant professor of mathematics at the University of Toronto. Then in\n1925\nhe returned to Trinity College, Dublin where he was elected to a fellowship and also appointed to the chair of Natural Philosophy\n(\nthe older name for Physics\n)\n.\nIn\n1930\nSynge headed back to North America and again was appointed to the University of Toronto, this time as Professor of Applied Mathematics. He spent some time in\n1939\nat Princeton University and, in\n1941\n, he was a visiting professor at Brown University. In\n1943\nSynge was appointed as Chairman of the Mathematics Department of Ohio State University, then, three years later, as Head of the Mathematics Department of the Carnegie Institute of Technology in Pittsburg. He also spent a short time as ballistic mathematician in the US Air Force during\n1944\n-\n45\n.\nIn\n1948\nhe returned to Ireland to take up the post of Senior Professor in the School of Theoretical Physics of the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies. This School, which had been set up when the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies had been founded in\n1940\n, had several outstanding members including\nErwin SchrÃ¶dinger\nwho was also a Senior Professor.\nP S Florides\n[\n3\n]\ndescribes the range of topics that Synge worked on:-\nProfessor Synge made outstanding contributions to widely varied fields: classical mechanics, geometrical mechanics and geometrical optics, gas dynamics, hydrodynamics, elasticity, electrical networks, mathematical methods,\ndifferential geometry\nand, above all,\nEinstein\n's theory of relativity.\nSynge's most important contributions to theoretical physics were, in many respects, the product of his great skill and insight as a geometer\n[\n3\n]\n:-\nHe felt just as much at home in the ordinary three dimensional Euclidean space as in the four dimensional space-time of relativity. In an astonishing paper in the Proceedings of the\nRoyal Irish Academy\n(\n...\n1950)\nhe was able, for the first time, to penetrate and explore in detail the region inside the\nSchwarzschild\nradius\n(\nwhat we now call a black hole\n)\n. At a time when many relativists thought that it did not even make sense to talk about this region, this work is very remarkable indeed.\nSynge retired in\n1972\nand during his time at the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies about\n12\n% of all workers in relativity theory studied there. Professor\nHermann Bondi\n, who gave the first J L Synge Public Lecture in\n1992\n, remarked:-\nEvery one of the other\n88\n% has been deeply influenced by his geometric vision and the clarity of his expression.\nDuring his long scientific career, Synge published over\n200\npapers and\n11\nbooks. Three of his books were aimed at providing an understanding of science to a wider audience and, with such a fine expository style, he was well suited to write such works. As Florides says in\n[\n3\n]\n:-\nEvery single book and every single paper is a remarkable work of art.\nSynge's classic, written in\n1956\n, had a large influence\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nIt is a remarkable fact that hardly a single space-time diagram is to be found in the standard texts on relativity before Synge's own presentation in\n1956\n. To many, the\n1956\nbook came as a revelation. Here was a royal road to relativity which did not involve precarious juggling with factors of\n1\nâ\nv\n2\nc\n2\n\\sqrt{1 - \\Large\\frac{v^2}{c^2}}\n1\nâ\nc\n2\nv\n2\nâ\nâ\n. The pervasive influence of the book can be traced in much of the best research in the last fifteen years\n[\nthis written in\n1971]\n, with its new emphasis on invariant geometrical characterisation.\nThe preface to the\n1956\nwork contains the delightful thought:-\nSplitting hairs in an ivory tower is not to everyone's liking and no doubt many a relativist looks forward to the day when governments will ask his advice on important questions.\nSynge's skill at communication was not only a gift that he had for writing, but also a gift in lecturing. His son-in-law Douglas Dryer wrote:-\nThose who have attended J. L.'s lectures well remember the effectiveness with which they were delivered. J. L. was by no means inattentive to achieving such effectiveness. Once, upon opening a public lecture he posed the question, if I recall correctly, as to whether a scientific lecture is to be compared with a theatrical performance, a religious sermon or a circus.\nThose who were fortunate enough to have attended Synge lectures say that he combined all three.\nSynge received many honours for his work. The greatest of these was probably his election as a fellow of the\nRoyal Society of London\nin\n1943\n. He was also elected a fellow of the\nRoyal Society of Canada\nand was president of the\nRoyal Irish Academy\nfrom\n1961\nto\n1964\n.\nHe is described in\n[\n3\n]\nas:-\n... a kind and generous man. He encouraged and inspired several generations of students who will always remember him with gratitude, fondness and the deepest respect.\nAs to hobbies, Synge was a keen cyclist, was passionately interested in sailing and painted some very fine compositions. In particular he painted a picture representing\nSchrÃ¶dinger\nheld in the hand of God contemplating unified field theory.\nSynge was a member of a highly talented family. We mention three other members of the family. First John Millington Synge\n(1871\n-\n1909)\n, John Lighton Synge's uncle, who was a playwright and a powerful poetic dramatist who portrayed the primitive life of the Aran Islands and the western Irish coast. Secondly there was Richard Laurence Millington Synge\n(1914\n-\n1994)\n, Nobel laureate for Chemistry in\n1952\n, who shared the Prize for Chemistry with A J P Martin for their development of partition chromatography, a method used to separate mixtures of closely related chemicals such as amino acids for identification. Thirdly we mention\nCathleen Synge Morawetz\n, Professor of Mathematics at the New York Courant Institute, who is John Lighton Synge's daughter. She was the first woman to hold the Directorship of the\nCourant\nInstitute and she was President of the\nAmerican Mathematical Society\nin\n1995\n-\n96\n.",
