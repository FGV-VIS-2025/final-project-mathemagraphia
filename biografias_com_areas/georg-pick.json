  "biografia": "Georg Pick\nwas born into a Jewish family. His mother was Josefa Schleisinger and his father was Adolf Josef Pick, the head of a private institute. Georg was educated at home by his father up to the age of eleven when he entered the fourth class of the Leopoldstaedter Communal\nGymnasium\n. He sat his school leaving examinations in\n1875\nwhich qualified him for university entrance.\nPick entered the University of Vienna in\n1875\n. He published a mathematics paper in the following year when only seventeen years old. He studied mathematics and physics, graduating in\n1879\nwith a qualification which would allow him to teach both of these subjects. In\n1877\nLeo KÃ¶nigsberger\nhad moved from Technische Hochschule in Dresden to take up a chair at the University of Vienna. He became Pick's supervisor and, on\n16\nApril\n1880\n, Pick was awarded his doctorate for his dissertation\nÃber eine Klasse abelscher Integrale\nâ\n(\nOn a class of abelian integrals\n)\n.\nEmil Weyr\nhad been appointed as second examiner of the thesis.\nAfter the award of his doctorate, Pick was appointed as an assistant to Ernest Mach at the Karl-Ferdinand University in Prague. Mach had moved from Graz, where he was professor of mathematics, to Prague in\n1867\nto take up the chair of physics there. He, like Pick, had studied at the University of Vienna and, by the time Pick became his assistant, he was regarded as one of the leading scientists in Europe. Pick now aimed at becoming a lecturer in Prague and in order to obtain the right to lecture he had to write an\nhabilitation\nthesis. This he did quite quickly and received the right to lecture in Prague in\n1881\nwith his habilitation thesis\nÃber die Integration hyperelliptischer Differentiale durch Logarithmen\nâ\n(\nThe integration of hyperelliptic differentials by logarithms\n)\n.\nExcept for the academic year\n1884\n-\n85\nwhich Pick spent studying under\nKlein\nat the University of Leipzig, he remained in Prague for the rest of his career. He was promoted to extraordinary professor of mathematics in\n1888\n, then he was appointed as ordinary professor\n(\nfull professor\n)\nin\n1892\nat the German University of Prague. His mathematical work was extremely broad and his\n67\npapers range across many topics such as linear algebra, invariant theory, integral calculus, potential theory, functional analysis, and geometry. However more than half of his papers were on functions of a complex variable, differential equations, and differential geometry. Terms such as 'Pick matrices', 'Pick-Nevanlinna interpolation', and the '\nSchwarz\n-Pick lemma' are sometimes used today. He is best remembered, however, for Pick's theorem which appeared in his eight page paper of\n1899\nGeometrisches zur Zahlenlehre\nâ\n(\nGeometric number theory\n)\npublished in Prague in\nSitzungber. Lotos, Naturwissen Zeitschrift\n.\nPick's theorem is on reticular geometry. The plane becomes a lattice on setting up two systems of parallel equally spaced straight lines in the plane. These Pick calls the 'main reticular lines' and their points of intersection are called 'reticular points'. A line joining any two reticular points is called a 'reticular line'. Notice that the main reticular lines are reticular lines but there are many other reticular lines. A polygon whose edges are reticular lines Pick calls a reticular polygon. Pick's theorem states that the area of a reticular polygon is\nL\n+\n1\n2\nB\nâ\n1\nL + \\large\\frac{1}{2}\\normalsize B - 1\nL\n+\n2\n1\nâ\nB\nâ\n1\nwhere\nL\nL\nL\nis the number of reticular points inside the polygon and\nB\nB\nB\nis the number of reticular points on the edges of the polygon. The result did not receive much attention after Pick published it, but in\n1969\nSteinhaus\nincluded it in his famous book\nMathematical Snapshots\n. From that time on Pick's theorem has attracted much attention and admiration for its simplicity and elegance.\nAt the German University of Prague Pick became dean of the philosophy faculty in\n1900\n-\n01\n. He supervised about\n20\nstudents for their doctorates, the most famous being\nCharles Loewner\nwho worked under Pick's supervision and was awarded his doctorate for his thesis on geometric function theory in\n1917\n. There is another aspect of Pick's life which merits attention. In\n1910\nhe was on a committee set up by the German University of Prague to consider appointing\nEinstein\nto the university. Pick was the driving force behind the appointment and\nEinstein\nwas appointed to a chair of mathematical physics at the German University of Prague in\n1911\n. He held this post until\n1913\nand during these years the two were close friends. Not only did they share scientific interests, but they also shared a passionate interest in music. Pick, who played in a quartet, introduced\nEinstein\ninto the scientific and musical societies of Prague. In fact Pick's quartet consisted of four professors from the university including Camillo KÃ¶rner, the professor of mechanical engineering.\nAfter Pick retired in\n1927\nhe was named professor emeritus and returned to Vienna, the town of his birth. However, in\n1938\nhe returned to Prague after the Anschluss on\n12\nMarch when German troops marched into Austria. At the end of September\n1938\nthe Prague government was asked to give Germany all districts of Bohemia and Moravia with populations that were\n50\npercent or more German. The leaders of Czechoslovakia resigned rather than agree, but those who took over gave the regions to Germany. Hitler's armies invaded on\n14\nMarch\n1939\nand Hitler installed his representative in Prague to run the country. Pick had been elected as a member of the\nCzech Academy of Sciences and Arts\n, but after the Nazis took over Prague, Pick was excluded from the Academy. The Nazis set up a camp at Theresienstadt in Nordboehmen on\n24\nNovember\n1941\nto house elderly, privileged, and famous Jews. Of around\n144\n,\n000\nJews sent to Theresienstadt about a quarter died there and around\n60\n% were sent on to Auschwitz or other death camps. Pick was sent to Theresienstadt on\n13\nJuly\n1942\nand he died there two weeks later aged\n82\n.\nHe was described as follows:-\nPick was a bachelor ... uncommonly correct in clothes and attitude.",
