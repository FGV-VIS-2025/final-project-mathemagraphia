  "biografia": "Born on\n1\nOctober\n1862\nin Paris, France,\nHenri Andoyer\nwas an astronomer and mathematician, fondly remembered for his strong work ethic, enthusiasm toward his subject, and dedication to teaching his students. His father, Louis Jules Andoyer, was a chief clerk at the Bank of France. His mother was Marie Antionette Doubliez. Armand Lambert writes in\n[\n12\n]\n:-\nEven as a child he already showed his inclination for calculation. On a rainy day, which stopped him from going to play in the gardens of Luxembourg, where his mother used to take him, and as she was about to console him, he clapped his hands with satisfaction: \"I will be able to have fun calculating;\" and all afternoon he carried out divisions, to his delight. He was barely old enough to understand things when the war of\n1870\nbroke out. His father took up arms and the young Henri was left with his mother to take refuge in Cherbourg. And shouldn't one see in his vivid memories from childhood the deep roots of the ardent patriotism which will animate him all his life?\nAndoyer's secondary education came at first at Harcourt College and then at the lycÃ©e St Louis, a secondary school located in the Latin Quarter of Paris, which he entered in\n1872\n. His teacher in the special mathematics class was Nicolas Dominique PiÃ©ron\n(1847\n-\n1906)\nto whom he retained an affectionate gratitude and with whom he remained friends. PiÃ©ron had studied at the Ãcole Normale SupÃ©rieure and taught mathematics in Caen, BesanÃ§on and the LycÃ©e Charlemagne in Paris before being appointed to the LycÃ©e St Louis in\n1877\n. Andoyer went on in\n1881\nto attend the Ãcole Normale SupÃ©rieure, one of the most highly regarded and prestigious higher education establishments outside of the public university system framework, having come top of the list in the entrance examination for the Grandes Ãcoles. He graduated at the top of his class in\n1884\n. At the Ãcole Normale SupÃ©rieure he initially specialised in pure mathematics which was the subject of his first degree, later turning to celestial mechanics, the subject in which he would achieve his doctor's degree.\nHe spent time from September\n1884\nin Toulouse filling both roles of teacher at the Faculty of Sciences and assistant at the observatory, having been employed by\nBenjamin Baillaud\n. He had been highly recommended by\nJules Tannery\nwho had taught him at the Ãcole Normale SupÃ©rieure, and he served in Toulouse for eight years. The observatory is best known for its contribution to the\nCarte du Ciel\nâ\n(\nMap of the sky\n)\nproject, a component of an international astronomical project, working to catalogue and map the positions of millions of stars as faint as\n11\nth or\n12\nth magnitude. Among other interests, he worked on the inequalities in the motion of the moon. He also made observations of the eclipses of the satellites of Jupiter and Saturn. It was at the observatory that he lived, until his marriage, in a room allotted to him.\nHe obtained his doctor's degree in\n1886\n, with a dissertation title\n(\npublished the following year\n)\nof\nContribution Ã  la thÃ©orie des orbites intermÃ©diaires\nâ\n(\nContribution to the theory of intermediate orbits\n)\nwhich was a study of the three-body problem. Among his publications at this time we mention\nSur un problÃ¨me de gÃ©omÃ©trie\nâ\n(\nOn a geometry problem\n)\n(1889)\n,\nSur les formules gÃ©nÃ©rales de la mÃ©canique cÃ©leste\nâ\n(\nOn the general formulae of celestial mechanics\n)\n(1890)\nand\nSur quelques inÃ©galitÃ©s de la longitude de la lune\nâ\n(\nOn some inequalities of the longitude of the moon\n)\n(1892)\n. On\n27\nMay\n1889\n, he married CÃ©leste Antoinette Marguerite PerissÃ©\n(\nborn\n29\nJune\n1866\nin Saint-Gaudens\n)\nin Toulouse. She was the daughter of Sermin Laurent Bertrand Firmin PerissÃ©, general secretary of a commercial and industrial syndicate in Toulouse, and Marie JosÃ©phine Crouzet.\nIn November\n1892\n, he returned to Paris upon his appointment at the Faculty of Science in Paris in the mathematics department. Ten years later, in\n1902\n, he was appointed assistant professor on\n25\nJanuary and as Professor of Astronomy on\n28\nJuly. In\n1912\nhe succeeded\nHenri PoincarÃ©\nas Professor of General Astronomy and Celestial Mechanics following\nPoincarÃ©\n's death.\nWe can see something of Andoyer's mathematics teaching through the publications of his lecture notes, for example:\nCours de gÃ©omÃ©trie: Ã  l'usage des Ã©lÃ¨ves de l'enseignement primaire supÃ©rieur: ouvrage rÃ©digÃ© conformÃ©ment au programme officiel de\n1893\nâ\n(\nGeometry course: for use by students in upper primary education: a work written in accordance with the official program of\n1893\n)\n(1\nst edition\n1894)\n,\n(2\nnd edition\n1895)\n,Â\n(3\nrd edition\n1896)\n;\nCours d'algÃ¨bre Ã  l'usage des Ã©lÃ¨ves de l'enseignement primaire supÃ©rieur\nâ\n(\nAlgebra course for higher elementary school students\n)\n(1896)\n;\nCours d'arithmÃ©tique Ã  l'usage des Ã©lÃ¨ves de l'enseignement primaire supÃ©rieur\nâ\n(\nArithmetic course for pupils in upper primary education\n)\n(2\nnd edition\n1898)\n;\nLeÃ§ons Ã©lÃ©mentaires sur la thÃ©orie des formes et ses applications gÃ©omÃ©trique, Ã  l'usage des candidats Ã  l'agrÃ©gation des sciences mathÃ©matiques\nâ\n(\nElementary lessons on the theory of forms and its geometric applications, for use by candidates for the Aggregation of Mathematical Sciences\n)\n(1898)\n; and\nLeÃ§ons sur la thÃ©orie des formes et la gÃ©omÃ©trie analytique supÃ©rieure, Ã  l'usage des Ã©tudiants des FacultÃ©s des Sciences.\nâ\n(\nLessons on the theory of forms and superior analytical geometry, for use by students of the Faculties of Science.\n)\nVolume\n1\n(1900)\n. E B Elliot, in the review\n[\n8\n]\nof this\n1900\npublication writes:-\nAndoyer's aim is to present didactically the theory of Forms, and develop its application to a perfectly general geometry; and he is singularly successful. His plan is marked by great breadth of view. Possibly he is too chary of space when general lessons could be enforced and illustrated by particularisation. To be at once precise and general is throughout his effort. His expression is both forcible and abbreviated, and his notation is condensed. Considering the extreme compression it is truly remarkable how clearly his arguments are stated. The volume has had to be a bulky one, and it has evidently been always in the author's mind to allow no diffuseness or repetition to further enlarge it. Constant and painstaking collaboration is demanded from the reader by \"il est clair,\" \"facile de dÃ©montrer,\" \"un calcul direct donne,\" and similar shortenings of demonstration. At times there is a suggestion of humour in the strife after brevity; as for instance when a short argument ends with a formula and the words \"d'oÃ¹ une proposition facile Ã  Ã©noncer.\" We commend to our problem makers the original idea of sketching a solution and asking for the question.\nHe published the first part of his two volume work\nCours d'Astronomie\nâ\n(\nAstronomy course\n)\nin\n1906\n. This first part on theoretical astronomy is reviewed in\n[\n14\n]\nwhere Kurt Laves writes that Andoyer's book serves the:-\n... needs of a mathematician who tries to inform himself about the application made in astronomy of a certain mathematical theorem he is interested in. ... After an introductory chapter concerning spherical trigonometry and a short deviation into spheroidal trigonometry to the extent to which this is needed for elementary geodesic questions, the author gives in the next seven chapters a rather condensed account of refraction, parallax and aberration. Before the theory of precession and nutation is taken up, the reader is initiated in Chapter\n9\ninto the more elementary notions of celestial mechanics. ... In the ninth chapter a short discussion is found concerning the convergence of series used in astronomy. It is the only place in the book where a knowledge beyond the differential and integral calculus is needed. Chapter\n10\nis devoted to precession and nutation and formulas are derived for the equatorial and elliptic coordinates to correct the position of an object for the secular and periodic changes in the position of the planes of reference. ... The last chapters of the book deal with the geocentric motions of the sun, moon, planets and their satellites. Here the eccentricities and inclinations are assumed to be zero to simplify the deductions. An elementary exposition of the theory of eclipses of moon and sun and of the occultation of stars by the moon finally ends this first part of Professor Andoyer's treatise.\nThe second part, on practical astronomy, was published in\n1909\n.W R Longley writes\n[\n15\n]\n:-\nThis volume completes the course, of which the first part deals with theoretical astronomy. As a text-book for a first course in practical astronomy, the subject matter of the second part is well chosen. Only the common instruments, namely, the theodolite, the equatorial, and the meridian transit are treated in detail ... In addition to the subject matter of observational astronomy the book contains an introductory chapter on numerical calculation, including the theory of interpolation and the method of least squares. The last chapter is an exposition of\nGauss\n's method for determining the elements of an elliptic or parabolic orbit from three complete observations.\nBesides teaching, Andoyer's work involved a lot of observational study. He travelled to El Arrouch, Algeria, in order to observe the total solar eclipse of\n30\nAugust\n1905\n. He also devoted much attention to the moon, working to revise the lunar theory set out by fellow French astronomer and mathematician,\nCharles-EugÃ¨ne Delaunay\n. Andoyer claimed that though\nDelaunay\n's terms were accurate up to the\n7\nth order, beyond that they were very inaccurate. He continued publication on this topic for the rest of his life, with his final paper on it published in\n1928\n. Andoyer also studied the\nn\nn\nn\n-body problem, the problem of predicting the individual motions of a group of celestial bodies gravitationally interacting with each other, expanding the results of\nJoseph Lagrange\nconcerning the equilibrium solutions for three bodies.\nFollowing the death of Jean Charles Rodolphe Radau\n(1835\n-\n1911)\non\n21\nDecember\n1911\n, Andoyer succeeded him in the role of writing the\nConnaissance des temps\nâ\n(\nUnderstanding time\n)\n, an annual publication of astronomical ephemerides in France. It also contained articles on various topics, giving a more in-depth insight, by famous astronomers.\nAndoyer was very dedicated to his teaching and to his pupils, publishing many of his lectures for their benefit, several of which we listed above. His small publication,\nThÃ©orie de la Lune\nâ\n(\nTheory of the Moon\n)\nwould be recommended to anyone who wished to introduce themselves to the complexities of the moon's motion. Moreover, between\n1911\nand\n1918\n, he was responsible for\n4\nlarge volumes of mathematical tables:\nTables of logarithms of Trigonometric Functions to\n14\ndecimals\n(1911)\nand\n3\nvolumes of\nTables of the natural Trigonometric Functions to\n15\ndecimals\n(1915\n,\n1916\n,\n1918)\n. He further did the computation for tables of addition and subtraction of logarithms, and also the computation for those of logarithms of numbers to a large number of decimal places. It was claimed that, for several years, he had dedicated three hours per day to this work. He published\nTables Logarithmiques Ã¡ treize dÃ©cimales\nâ\n(\nLogarithmic Tables to thirteen decimal places\n)\nin\n1923\nwhich was reviewed in\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nProf Andoyer's\n13\n-place logarithm tables are based on the fact that any number may be expressed as the product of its first three figures and a number of which the first three figures are\n100\n. He thus reduces his tables to\nÂ Â\n(1)\nÂ  a\n13\n-place table of three-figure numbers and\nÂ Â\n(2)\nÂ  a\n13\n-place table of the numbers from\n100\n,\n000\nto\n101\n,\n000\n.\nIn the second table the first differences of the logarithms are tabulated and on a supplementary page are given the proportional parts of the second difference ... . A third table is also given containing the antilogs of\n00000\nto\n00432\n(\ncovering the range from log\n100\nto log\n101)\nwith first differences and a page of proportional parts of second differences as in the second table. The use and application of the tables will be obvious.\nSeveral of his important works on the history of mathematical astronomy should be mentioned. For example there is\nA propos de l'Almageste de PtolÃ©mÃ©e\nâ\n(\nOn the Almagest of Ptolemy\n)\n(1928)\n,\nA propos des oeuvres de Copernic\nâ\n(\nOn the works of Copernicus\n)\n(1928)\n,\n(\nwith\nPierre Humbert\n)\nHistoire des Sciences en France, MathÃ©matique, MÃ©chanique, Astronomie\nâ\n(\nHistory of sciences in France, Mathematics, Mechanics, Astronomy\n)\n, and\nL'Oeuvre scientifique de Laplace\nâ\n(\nThe scientific work of Laplace\n)\n(1922)\n.\nFlorian Cajori\nwrites in a review about this last mentioned work\n[\n5\n]\n:-\nAfter a brief sketch of the life of\nLaplace\n, Andoyer sets forth the characteristics of the works of this great French scientist. Andoyer cites the problems in celestial mechanics, which the eighteenth century mathematicians encountered, and reminds the reader how, through insufficient approximation, doubt was cast for a time upon the validity of\nNewton\n's law of inverse squares, and how a closer numerical approximation dispelled those doubts. Andoyer presents evidence showing the excessive harshness of the judgment passed upon\nLaplace\nby certain writers, to the effect that\nLaplace\n, in his writings, often failed to give due credit to his predecessors and contemporaries.\nLaplace\n's relations to\nD'Alembert\n,\nBiot\nand\nPoisson\nare described. Andoyer explains how\nLaplace\nagain and again returned to certain topics in order that he might improve his exposition and perhaps free the subject from metaphysical entanglements. Not altogether surprising is\nLaplace\n's lack of interest in certain abstract fields of mathematics, like the theory of numbers. But strange is\nLaplace\n's adherence to\nNewton\n's corpuscular theory of light a quarter of a century after\nThomas Young\nhad advocated the undulatory theory and a decennium after\nFresnel\nhad won\nArago\nover to the latter theory.  Andoyer's masterly account of\nLaplace\n's researches on celestial mechanics, on the figure of the earth, on the tides, on the systÃ¨me du monde, on the analytical theory of probability, and of researches on physics contains numerous quotations from the works of\nLaplace\n, bearing on points of scientific and philosophical interest. Andoyer's booklet will be enjoyed by students interested in the evolution of the mathematical sciences.\nIn\n1923\nAndoyer published the first volume of his two volume work\nCours de MÃ©canique CÃ©leste\nâ\n(\nCourse of celestial mechanics\n)\n,  the second volume being published in\n1926\n. The review of the first volume\n[\n3\n]\nstates:-\nFor twenty years it has fallen to the lot of Prof Andoyer to give an annual course, each lasting some six months and covering the ground that must be traversed by all who hope to embark with success upon the work of astronomical computations - a field in which the author of the book before us has won for himself the highest reputation. His aim is to give as simply and fully as possible to computers and practical astronomers the practical solutions afforded by Astronomy to the real problems of Celestial Mechanics. As he tells us in his Preface, to facilitate his task he confines himself almost exclusively to a development in all necessary detail of the methods which lead to the simplest and most trustworthy calculations. In the new and revised edition of his great 'Cours d'Astronomie', he has made a special point of utilising problems borrowed from reality to illustrate the numerical application of the formulae he establishes - e.g. the lunar eclipse of Feb.\n8\n,\n1925\n, the transit of Mercury of May\n7\n,\n1924\n, the solar eclipse of January\n24\n,\n1925\n. This excellent practice he has followed in the present treatise, and the resulting impression made upon the student by this contact with actualities cannot fail to be effective and lasting.\nAndoyer was recognised for his work by receiving many honours. He became a member of the\nFrench Mathematical Society\nin\n1896\n. He was awarded the PontÃ©coulant Prize by the\nAcademy of Sciences\nin\n1903\n.  In\n1910\n, he became a member of the Bureau des Longitudes, he was elected to membership of the\nRoyal Astronomical Society\non\n13\nNovember\n1913\nand of the\nAcademy of Sciences\non\n30\nJune\n1919\n. He was also offered the directorship of the Paris Observatory, a role which he declined. He was also an Officer of the Legion of Honour\n(\nthe second of\n5\norders of distinction, which required\n8\nyears of service as Knight, which required\n25\nyears of professional activity with \"eminent merits\"\n)\n.\nHenri and CÃ©leste Andoyer had three children of which two were sons, one a daughter. The eldest of the sons, Firmin Marie RaphÃ¤el Andoyer, born in Toulouse on\n13\nÂ FebruaryÂ\n1890\n, was killed at Brabant-sur-Meuse on\n11\nÂ JanuaryÂ\n1915\nduring the First World War. The second son, Georges Leeon Andoyer was born in Toulouse on\n8\nDecember\n1890\n. He became an engineer and worked for the North Railway Company as the head of the laboratory. Their daughter, Henriette Juliette Andoyer\n(\nborn in\n1892)\n, married the mathematician\nPierre Humbert\non\n28\nApril\n1914\n. This connection to Andoyer supposedly increased\nHumbert\n's interest in the history of astronomy.\nAndoyer died in Paris on\n12\nJune\n1929\n. The announcement in\nNature\nstates\n[\n9\n]\n:-\nBy the death on June\n12\nof Marie Henri Andoyer at the age of sixty-six years, French science has lost a distinguished member of the characteristic school of mathematical astronomers of which such men as\nTisserand\nand Radau were eminent examples and\nHenri PoincarÃ©\nthe most brilliant ornament. In Andoyer a rare combination of qualities were united. To his knowledge and ability as a mathematician and his acquaintance with the technical side of practical astronomy he joined a skill and a passion for numerical calculation which recalls the kindred taste of\nJ C Adams\nin England. He was at the same time a gifted teacher. with an enthusiasm and critical sense which made his exposition equally attractive in the shape of lectures or in published form.",
