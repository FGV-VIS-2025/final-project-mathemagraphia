  "biografia": "Edward Sang\n, was theÂ son of the nurseryman Edward SangÂ\n(1771\n-\n1862)\nand his wife Jean NicolÂ\n(1775\n-\n1840)\n. Edward Sang Sr had been born in Montrose and was a more learned man than the occupation of nurseryman would suggest for he had written scholarly articles, for example\nOn Destroying the Caterpillars Infesting Fruit Trees\n(1814)\nin which he describes a scientific approach to treating his fruit trees on Loanwell's garden walls. He also served for a while as Provost of Kirkcaldy. He married Jean Nicol on\n31\nJuly\n1792\nat Abbotshall, Kirkcaldy. She had been born at Liberton, Midlothian on\n18\nDecember\n1775\n. They had eleven children: Margaret Sang\n(1793\n-?\n)\n; Jean Sang\n(1795\n-\n1861)\n; Mary Sang\n(1797\n-\n1880)\n; David Sang\n(1800\n-\n1842)\n; Ann Sang\n(1802\n-\n1889)\n; Edward Sang\n(1805\n-\n1890)\n, the subject of this biography; Helen Sang\n(1807\n-\n1808)\n; John Sang\n(1809\n-\n1887)\n; Walter Sang\n(1812\n-\n1868)\n; William Sang\n(1817\n-\n1896)\n; and Florinda Chalmers Sang\n(1823\n-\n1886)\n. We note that Jean Sang, the mother of our mathematician, was a sister of the geologist William NicolÂ\n(1766\n-\n1851)\nÂ who invented the Nicol prism in\n1828\n. This was the first device invented to produce plane polarized light. Edward Sang Sr was a member of the Berean church, a small sect founded by John Barclay in\n1773\n. The Bereans did not believe in infant baptism, so none of Sang's eleven children were baptised.\nEdward Sang, the subject of this biography, attended a subscription school, founded by his father and others, under a gifted but unconventional headmaster Edward Irving\n(1792\n-\n1834)\n. Irving, a friend of\nThomas Carlyle\n, had studied mathematics under\nJohn Leslie\nat the University of Edinburgh, then taught at Haddington before moving to the subscription school in Kirkcaldy in\n1812\nwhere he remained for six years. At this school, Edward showed great abilities and completed his education there at the age of twelve. He was awarded the top prize, and given a copy of\nLegendre\n's\nElÃ©ments de gÃ©omÃ©trie\n. It seems remarkable that a twelve year old boy could read such a book, but this certainly tells us something of his abilities. He entered Edinburgh University inÂ\n1818\nat the age of thirteen which is not quite as unbelievable as it sounds to us today for at that time the Scottish universities competed with the secondary schools for the brightest pupils. Nevertheless, Sang was a small lad for his age and must of looked a little out of place. This led to his fellow students making fun of him at first, but as soon as his talents became clear they were rather in awe of him. Sang enrolled in\nJohn Leslie\n's second mathematics class and studied this during the academic year\n1818\n-\n19\n. In\n1819\nLeslie\nmoved from the chair of mathematics at the chair of physics and\nWilliam Wallace\nbecame professor of mathematics. Sang's time at university was not straightforward since he had periods of illness, but he greatly impressed both\nLeslie\nand\nWallace\nand they both wrote very strong reports on their outstanding pupil when he completed his university studies in\n1824\n.\nLet us say a little about John Sang, Edward's younger brother, at this point. John, born in Kirkcaldy on\n13\nAugust\n1809\n, also attended Edward Irving's subscription school and, like his brother, he showed great abilities. He practised as a civil engineer and road surveyor from\n1832\n, his first major contract being sections of the York-Peterborough railway. In the later\n1830\ns he laid out a road from Boreland, Kirkcaldy to Leven and was employed in Inverness and Skye. His younger brother William and other members of the family looked after the Kirkcaldy business while he was away.Â We should also comment on Edward's uncle, the geologist William Nicol, who lectured in physics at the University of Edinburgh before retiring to do research in Edinburgh. He did not begin to publish his research findings until\n1826\n, when he was sixty years old. He was a major influence on the education of both Edward and John Sang.\nEdward Sang first worked in Edinburgh as a surveyor, civil engineer and mathematics teacher and lectured on natural philosophy, as an assistant to John Leslie. He was elected a fellow of the Society of Arts for Scotland in\n1828\n. He read the\nFirst Essay, preliminary to the Series of Reports on the Progress of the Useful Arts, ordered by the Society of Arts for Scotland\nto the Society on\n5\nSeptember\n1834\n. we quote from his essay\n[\n26\n]\n:-\nIf we run over the history of the great improvements that have been made, we will find that almost all of them have come from the minds of those who have attended to a considerable variety of subjects. The great improver of the steam-engine was not an engine maker, nor did the contrivance of the stocking-frame come from one tired with the monotonous manipulation; and I question much if any of the users of the distaff ever entertained the idea that it could be dispensed with. The method of co-ordinates of the higher geometricians, after improving astronomy and geodetics, descended to plan the slide-rest, and the planing-engine; and had no intercourse existed between the art of working iron, and the abstruse science of applied algebra, we might yet have wanted those excellent instruments. An extensive knowledge, in fact, of what can be done with materials is essential to the contrivance of new modes of operating; or even necessary to the successful repetition of operations already known.\nDuring the\n1830\nhe taught mathematics in Edinburgh, and is listed as living at\n32\nSt Andrew Square. On\n22\nJanuary\n1832\n, he married Isabel Elmslie\n(1803\n-\n1880)\nin Edinburgh. Isabel was born in Tannadice, Forfar, Angus, the daughter of the Tannadice village schoolmaster William Elmslie and his wife Ann Wilkie. Edward and Isabel Sang had five children: Anna Wilkie Sang\n(1832\n-\n1917)\n, Jane Nicol Sang\n(1834\n-\n1878)\n, Edward Elmslie Sang\n(1835\n-\n1882)\n, Flora Chalmers Sang\n(1838\n-\n1925)\n, and Isabella Miller Sang\n(1841\n-\n1884)\n. None of his five children married. His only son, Elmslie Sang, trained as a civil engineer but sadly died in the Royal Lunatic Asylum in\n1882\n, eight years before his father died.\nSang was elected a fellow of the\nRoyal Society of Edinburgh\non\n2\nMay\n1836\nhaving been proposed by Thomas Dick Lauder\n(1784\n-\n1848)\n. Lauder was an author with broad interests in engineering, geology, music and art. He served as secretary of the Royal Institution for the Encouragement of the Fine Arts.\nThe chair of mathematics at the University of Edinburgh became vacant in\n1838\nwhen\nWilliam Wallace\nretired. Sang applied for the chair, as did another local man\nJohn Scott Russell\n. Neither Sang nor\nJohn Russell\nwere seriously considered for the chair, the two top contenders being\nPhilip Kelland\nand\nDuncan Farquharson Gregory\n;\nKelland\nwas successful. We note that he also competed for the chair of Natural Philosophy at Edinburgh in\n1859\nbut again was not a serious challenger, the competition being between\nTait\nand\nMaxwell\n. Sang cancelled his fellowship of the\nRoyal Society of Edinburgh\non\n3\nApril\n1840\n(\nhe was re-elected in\n1849)\n.\nDuringÂ\n1841\n-\n43\nÂ Sang was Professor of Mechanical Sciences at the nonconformist Manchester New College. This Unitarian College was founded in Manchester in\n1786\nbut had moved to York in\n1804\n. It returned to Manchester in\n1840\n, just before Sang was appointed, but moved to London in\n1853\nand has now become Marris Manchester College, Oxford. After two years in Manchester, Sang went to Constantinople to establish engineering schools, plan railways and an ironworks. He was appointed Professor of Civil and Mechanical Engineering in Constantinople where he lecturedÂ\n(\nin Turkish\n)\nÂ at the Imperial School, Muhendis-hana Berii, and gained fame by predicting the solar eclipse of\n1847\n, thereby dispelling superstition. Sang received an invitation from the Astronomer Royal to go to Russia to observe the solar eclipse of\n28\nJuly\n1851\n. He had made observations in Edinburgh during the solar eclipse of\n17\nJuly\n1833\nand the annular eclipse of\n15\nMay\n1836\nand was making arrangements to observe the partial eclipse in Constantinople. He did not receive the invitation in time to reach Odessa as he explained in his report\n[\n28\n]\n:-\nUnfortunately, His Excellency's note of date July\n12\nth only reached me on the\n15\nth, and the very next was the sailing day of the Odessa steamer; it was utterly impossible to complete my arrangements in time; there would be no other opportunity by steam until the\n26\nth, and thus our only chance of reaching the Crimea previously to the eclipse, was by a sailing vessel; this chance, too, with the prevailing north winds, and the high state of the barometer, was a very small one. So long, however, as a possibility of success remained, I was determined not to abandon the enterprise.\nHe managed to reach Sebastopol and made observations there. He resigned his position in Constantinople against the wishes of Sultan Abdul-Mejid I, and returned to Edinburgh inÂ\n1854\n. Being in Constantinople with his wife and children, it is likely that the political situation was the main reason for him leaving since the Ottoman Empire was at war with Russia from July\n1853\nwhen the Russians invaded the area which is today Romania, then under Ottoman control. Back in Edinburgh he had premises at\n2\nGeorge Street where he taught mathematics and acted as a consultant on actuarial matters.Â He was a founder member of the Faculty of Actuaries in Scotland which was established in\n1856\nand did much work setting up qualifying actuarial examinations and a library. He was the first lecturer to the Faculty giving four lectures in the year after it was established\n[\n18\n]\n:-\nOne of the petitioners for our Royal Charter in\n1856\nwas Edward Sang who was one of the first four examiners. Edward Sang was appointed  'lecturer to the Faculty', and delivered four lectures the following year, the second of which was entitled 'The Commercial, Moral and Social Influences of Assurances - the Applicability of the Principle in Difference Circumstances'. Thus, the moral issues of the conflict between professional standards and the commercial interests of employers who, as the Associated Scottish Life Offices had been in existence from\n1841\nas the first insurance trade association in the world, was recognised. The professional standards required a high set of moral principles in a profession where the vast majority of members were employed in commercial concerns.\nAlex Craik\nlists some of the topics Sang published on:-\nMainly in Edinburgh-based journals, Sang wrote extensively on mathematical, mechanical, optical and actuarial topics including vibration of wires, a theory of toothed wheels, an improved lighthouse light, railways, bridges, manufacturing and life insurance. He published actuarial, annuity and astronomical tables, books on Elementary and Higher Arithmetic and much-used tables of\n7\n-place logarithms\n(1871)\n.\nHe published around\n200\nitems, all on applied mathematics if we take that in its broadest sense. His books\nElementaryÂ ArithmeticÂ\n(1856)\nand\nHigher Arithmetic\n(1857)\nmentioned in the quote above are interesting in that in the second he shows how to calculate and use\n7\n-place logarithms. He writes in the Preface to\nHigher Arithmetic\n:-\nTo those who have only considered the subjects of direct, inverse, and fractional powers, and the cognate subject of Logarithms, in the light which the modern notation throws upon them, it may seem vain to attempt to explain these matters with no aid beyond that of our ordinary numeral notation; but an examination of the following pages may serve to show that the mind does not require the aid of artificial symbols to detect and appreciate even recondite properties of numbers; and the Author flatters himself that he has brought the leading properties of Logarithms completely within the bounds of arithmetic.\nFor the Prefaces of these two books, see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nThere is no doubt that Sang's most remarkable achievement is his massive unpublished compilation ofÂ\n26\n- andÂ\n15\n-place logarithmic, trigonometric and astronomical tables, fillingÂ\n47\nÂ manuscript volumes. Compiled over forty years, latterly with assistance from two daughters Flora and Jane, these perhaps surpass in accuracy theÂ\n(\nalso unpublished\n)\nÂ French 'Cadastre' tables ofÂ\n1801\n.\nSang gave an account of these tables in November\n1890\nwhich we give at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nSang's manuscripts were gifted to the nationÂ by Anna Wilkie Sang and Flora Chalmers Sang with the following communication sent on\n1\nJuly\n1907\n[\n29\n]\n:-\nWe, the daughters of the late Dr Edward Sang, LL.D., F.R.S.E., owners under his will of his collection of MS. calculations in trigonometry and astronomy, having by letter of gift of date February\n12\nth,\n1906\n, given the above collection to the president and Council of the\nRoyal Society of Edinburgh\n, and having by the cancelling on the\n24\nth May\n1907\nof their acceptance thereof received back the collection from the president and Council of the\nRoyal Society of Edinburgh\n, do hereby give the said collection to the British nation, and do hereby appoint the president and Council of the\nRoyal Society of Edinburgh\ncustodiers of the said collection in trust for the British nation, with power to publish such parts as may be judged useful to the scientific world.\nWe note that these two daughters were the only ones of Sang's five children to survive him.\nCargill Knott\nwrites in\n[\n15\n]\n:-\nIt was the existence of this remarkable and truly monumental work which suggested to the Council of the\nRoyal Society of Edinburgh\nthe idea of celebrating in some appropriate way the three hundredth anniversary of the publication of the first book of logarithms.\nOn\n5\nNovember\n1868\nSang, as President, addressed the Actuarial Society of Edinburgh. We give a version of his address at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nIn\n1851\n, John Sang, Edward's brother, invented the planimeter, used for measuring irregular figures drawn on paper. An example of his instrument was exhibited at the\n1851\nexhibition in the Science Museum in London. Edward Sang gave the lecture\nOn Mechanical Aids to Calculation\nto the Actuarial Society of Edinburgh in which he described his brother's planimeter\n(\ncalled a platometer at this time\n)\n.\nYou can read Sang's lecture, including his description of the planimeter, at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nWe can't expect someone who was prepared to dedicate much of his life to constructing tables, to expect calculating machines to make such tables redundant. He finished his lecture on mechanical aids as follows:-\nThus, on the whole, arithmeticians have not much to expect from the aid of calculating machines. A few tables, otherwise very easily made, comprise the whole extent of our expected benefits; and we must fall back upon the wholesome truth that we cannot delegate our intellectual functions, and say to a machine, to a formula, to a rule, or to a dogma, I am too lazy to think, do please think for me.\nThere are a number of concepts that Sang anticipated. For example Joseph Lovering writes in\nAnticipation of the Lissajous Curve\n[\n17\n]\n:-\nIn\n1832\n, Edward Sang of Edinburgh developed mathematically the resultant of two rectangular vibrations, having different periods and phases, and illustrated his subject by experiments with round and flat wires, which produced the peculiar\nLissajous\ncurves.\nD'Arcy Thompson\n, when President of the\nRoyal Society of Edinburgh\n, gave the address\n[\n32\n]\nin which he noted that Sang wrote a paper on the Nicol prism which was read to the Society in\n1837\nbut it:-\n... was never published, no one knows why; and when\n[\nSang\n]\nwas dying he spoke of it to\nTait\n.\nTait\nmade instant search among our files for the paper, had it read and printed - but poor Sang was dead. Had it been published when it was written it would have been one of the most important scientific papers of the time.\nIn addition to his election to the\nRoyal Society of Edinburgh\n, and to the Royal Scottish Society of Arts he was elected a corresponding member of the Royal Tunis Academy and an honorary member of the Franklin Institute, Philadelphia. He was awarded prizes by the Royal Scottish Society of Arts\n(1861)\n, by the Institution of Civil Engineers, London\n(1879)\n, and by the\nRoyal Society of Edinburgh\n(1886)\n.\nSang died at his home,\n31\nMayfield Road, Edinburgh and was buried in Newington Cemetery, Edinburgh. Sang, his wife and all five children are on the tombstone making the grave.",
