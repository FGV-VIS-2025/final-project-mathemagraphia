  "biografia": "Soviet Armenian astrophysicist\nVictor Amazaspovich Ambartsumian\n(\nViktor Hamazaspi Hambardzumyan\n)\nwas born on\n18\nSeptember\n1908\n, old style\n5\nSeptember\n1908\n, to an Armenian family, in Tiflis, now known as Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia. His father, Amazasp Asaturovich Ambartsumian, was a philologist, who was responsible for a translation of Homer's\nIliad\ninto Armenian. He undertook research on the historical development and relationship of languages and became a professor at Yerevan University. Victor's mother was Ripsame Ambartsumian. Victor was one of three children, having an older sister who became the chairman of the Department of Probability Theory at Yerevan University and a younger brother who died at the age of\n23\nwhile working on a geophysical expedition as an operator.\nIt was Amazasp who encouraged the development of Victor's aptitude for mathematics and physics. He\n[\n28\n]\n:-\n... even showed off to his friends that he had such a son who could already multiply when he was all of three or four years old.\nBy the time he was of an age to begin his formal schooling in the junior preparatory class, he had to sit a test before being accepted. Given an arithmetic problem he could easily do in his head, he wrote down the correct answer. He was failed and when his father angrily\n(\nVictor said his father was a hot-headed man\n)\ndemanded to know why his son had been failed he was told that the problem was a hard one and all steps of the working were necessary. Victor's father then said he would teach his son himself and he would go straight into the senior class. This is what happened and after two years, during which time he learnt Russian, he entered the first class of the Gymnasium.\nAmbartsumian loved mathematics and became interested in astronomy at the age of twelve after reading a Russian translation of\nThe Planetary and Stellar Worlds\n(1848)\nby Ormsby McKnight Mitchel\n(1809\n-\n1862)\n. The Russian translation, published in\n1859\n, was entitled\nThe Celestial Bodies, or Planetary and star worlds. Popular exposition of the great discoveries and theories of modern astronomy\n(\nRussian\n)\n. His teacher at the Gymnasium wrote on one of his reports, \"this boy can become in future the founder of an astronomical observatory in Armenia.\" Ambartsumian gave lectures on astronomy while at the Gymnasium and, discovering that a Moscow trained astronomer Nikolai Ignatevich Sudakov was teaching at another Tiflis school he transferred there. Ambartsumian completed the Gymnasium courses rapidly and graduated before his sixteenth birthday. Following his father's advice, he decided to study at the University of Leningrad, a good choice since the Pulkovo Observatory was close to the city.\nArriving in Leningrad too late in\n1924\nto enter the University of Leningrad in that year, he studied in the Mathematics and Physics department of the Herzen Pedagogical Institute for eighteen months. In\n1925\n, Ambartsumian entered into the University of Leningrad\n(\nwhat is now known as the St Petersburg State University\n)\n, as an undergraduate, hoping to devote his life's work to the research of astrophysics. One of his fellow undergraduates was\nSergei L'vovich Sobolev\nwho specialised in mathematics. Other student friends included\nLev Davidovich Landau\nand George Gamow\n(1904\n-\n1968)\n. Ambartsumian published a paper devoted to sun jets in\n1926\n,\nEine Methode der Bestimmung der Hole der Sonnenfackeln nach der Veranderung ihrer Helligkeit\nâ\n(\nA method of determining the hole of a sun jet after changing its brightness\n)\n, the first of ten papers that he would publish as an undergraduate. This\n1926\npaper was a joint work with his fellow student Nikolai Alexandrovich Kozyrev\n(1908\n-\n1983)\n. Recalling his student years he said\n[\n25\n]\n:-\nDuring my studies at the University of Leningrad I paid chief attention to astronomy and mathematical courses. While I always felt the necessity of a better knowledge of physics, at that time this discipline did not attract me much. It is true that during my last two university years the logical beauty of quantum mechanics as well as some aspects of statistical physics deeply impressed me.\nGraduating in\n1928\n, he went on to continue his studies as a postgraduate at the Pulkovo Observatory near Leningrad\n(\nnow St Petersburg\n)\n, under the supervision of Aristarkh Apollonovich Belopolsky\n(1854\n-\n1934)\nwho had worked at Pulkovo Observatory from\n1888\n. Ambartsumian continued to undertake research at the Observatory until\n1931\n.\nAn early step on his road to recognition was taken with his paper,\nÃber eine Folgerung der Diracschen Theorie der Protonen und Electronen\nâ\n(\nOn an Inference from Dirac's theory of protons and electrons\n)\nwritten jointly with Dmitri Dmitrievich Ivanenko\n(1904\n-\n1994)\nin\n1929\n. Ivanenko was, at this time, working at the Physical Mathematical Institute of\nUSSR Academy of Sciences\nin Leningrad. Their publication showed that the atomic nucleus could not be made up of protons and electrons. This was soon confirmed, when three years later, Sir James Chadwick discovered neutrons, which, together with protons, make up atomic nuclei.\nHe married Vera Feodorovna Klochihina\n(\nborn at Lisva, Solikamsk uyezd, Perm\n)\nin\n1931\nand joined the Communist Party of the USSR in\n1940\n.\nHe spent the years\n1931\n-\n43\nlecturing at the University of Leningrad, heading the astrophysical department. It was in\n1932\nthat\nMonthly Notices\nof the\nRoyal Astronomical Society\npublished his paper \"\nOn the radiative equilibrium of a planetary nebula\n\", now considered a cornerstone of the modern theory of the gas nebulae. This led to a series of research articles developing the topic further. After three years' affiliation with Leningrad University, Ambartsumian founded and headed the first astrophysics chair in\n1934\n, making him a professor at the university.\nFor the problems at the Pulkovo Observatory during the\n1930\ns, see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nIn\n1938\nhe came up with the first idea about the patchy structure of interstellar absorption.\nChandrasekhar\nwrites in\n[\n12\n]\n:-\nAmbartsumian's marvellously elegant formulation of the fluctuations in brightness of the Milky Way in the limit of infinite optical depth, showed that the probability distribution of the fluctuations in the brightness of the Milky Way is invariant with the respect to the location of the observer.\nThe War years provided obstacles for Ambartsumian and his work. Having served as director of the Leningrad University Observatory between\n1938\nand\n1941\n, he and the laboratories of the University were relocated to the remote Yelabuga, Tatarstan in west Russia in\n1941\n. This relocation was, of course, forced because of German forces advancing towards Leningrad. Ambartsumian spent four years there directing the work of the laboratories working both on military problems and on the scattering of light. Between\n1941\nand\n1943\n, Ambartsumian was appointed pro-rector of the University, and while in this role he developed his theory of the behaviour of light in a scattering medium of cosmic space. This became an important tool in geophysics, space research and particularly astrophysics.\nThe\nArmenian Academy of Sciences\nwas founded on\n10\nNovember\n1943\nas a branch of the\nUSSR Academy of Sciences\n. Ambartsumian returned to Armenia to become the first vice-president of the new Academy. In addition, in\n1944\nhe founded the first chair of Astrophysics at Yerevan University and was appointed as director of the Yerevan Observatory.\nIn\n1946\n, he organised the construction of the Byurakan Astronomical Observatory\n30\nkm from Yerevan, the capital of Armenia. This site was well chosen at a height of\n1500\nmetres above sea level on Mt Aragats. Here he began another successful period of activity as the director of the observatory, a role he would maintain until\n1988\n[\n25\n]\n:-\nWhile the construction of the Observatory was proceeding, a small group of young astronomers\n(\nincluding Benjamin Markarian, Hayk Badalyan and a student Grigor Gurzadyan\n)\nstarted observations with very modest facilities. They had to design or even build many instruments themselves. In later years the Observatory supplied both telescopes and other facilities, and the students came mainly from the graduates of the astrophysical department of Yerevan University. The official inauguration of the Observatory took place in\n1956\n, marked by a symposium with the participation of numerous astronomers from all over the world. Ambartsumian made Byurakan an internationally known scientific centre. In conditions when the communications with the West were rather complicated\n(\nthe cold war years\n)\nhe managed to link Byurakan by active bilateral collaboration with the Abastumani Observatory in Georgia, with observatories in Bulgaria, Hungary, Eastern Germany, Romania and Czechoslovakia. Among his students were those from Russia, Georgia, Ukraine, Azerbaijan, Hungary, Bulgaria, etc. However, even in those conditions several\nInternational Astronomical Union\n(\nIAU\n)\nSymposia and numerous conferences with participation of western scholars were held in Byurakan.\nBy\n1947\n, he had discovered a new type of comparatively recent stellar system, which he named \"stellar association\"\n[\n27\n]\n:-\nThis concept, which involves the interrelationships between great complexes of gas, dust, and stars, like the region of the Orion Nebula, has proven invaluable in our efforts to understand the processes of star creation and development. Ambartsumian's work in this fascinating field has undoubtedly been one of the most powerful influences in stimulating modern research on stellar evolution and galactic structure.\nChandrasekhar\n, who had first met Ambartsumian in\n1935\n, recalled many years later\n(\nsee\n[\n27\n]\n)\n:-\nI recall the early scepticism with which this discovery was received by the astronomers of the 'establishment' when I first gave an account of Ambartsumian's paper at the colloquium at the Yerkes Observatory in late\n1950\n.\nThe most important of his results concluded that the process of stellar formation in the Milky Way still continues and that most stars have their origin in developing systems of groups of stars.\nAmbartsumian also studied radio signals coming from outside the Milky Way. His conclusion of these studies contradicted the widely accepted interpretation of the time, that these radio signals are received from star system collisions. Instead, he forwarded the idea that the signals were due to the subatomic process of fission within galaxies. Thus, according to his view, 'radio galaxies' may represent systems of stars interacting in close proximity, that were formed from super-dense formations of stellar material.\nHis textbook\nTheoretical Astrophysics\n, published in\n1958\n, went through many editions and translations, containing examples of his unique approaches to difficult astronomical problems. Moreover, he is credited with having a popular and engaging lecturing style, drawing large audiences at international symposia. He is known to have added in poetic quotes to even his most mathematical addresses.\nThroughout his career, he was made a member of many academic societies and academies, establishing himself considerably in them. He was elected in\n1939\nas a corresponding member of the\nUSSR Academy of Sciences\n, becoming a full academician in\n1953\n. He was appointed founding vice-president of the\nArmenian Academy of Sciences\nin Yerevan in\n1943\n, under the presidency of Joseph Orbeli. He began teaching at the Yerevan State University.\nAmbartsumian succeeded Orbeli and became the longest serving president of the Academy, heading it from\n1947\nto\n1993\n. Following this reign, he was made an Honorary President of the Academy. He served as president of the\nInternational Astronomical Union\nfrom\n1961\nto\n1964\n, and was twice elected the president of the International Council of Scientific Unions serving between\n1966\nand\n1972\n, having previously worked as vice-president\n(1948\n-\n1956)\n. Adriaan Blaauw writes\n[\n9\n]\n:-\nAmbartsumian's term as a Vice-President of the\nInternational Astronomical Union\ncoincided with the years of the cold war between the western powers and the Soviet Union. In those years, the\nInternational Astronomical Union\nwent through a critical stage in its existence as a consequence of the International Astronomical Union Executive Committee's decision to postpone the General Assembly that had been planned for\n1951\nin Leningrad. During the subsequent years, although vigorously contesting the Executive Committee's decision, Ambartsumian did not fail to continue his support to the Union as the world-wide organisation embracing astronomers from all countries. His election as President of the\nInternational Astronomical Union\nin\n1961\nreflected both the appreciation for his efforts in this respect and his outstanding scientific achievements.\nHe was also a foreign member of many societies, including the\nRoyal Society\nin Britain, the\nNational Academy of Sciences\nin the United States, and the\nIndian Academy of Sciences\n.\nAdditionally, he received many awards for his services to science. Twice the recipient of the Stalin Prize\n(1946\n,\n1950)\n, once the Gold Medal of the\nRoyal Astronomical Society\n(1960)\n, once the Bruce Gold Medal of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific\n(1960)\n, he also received the Hero of Socialist Labour award\n(1968\n,\n1978)\n, and the National Hero of Armenia award\n(1994)\n. These are only a few of the numerous honours bestowed on him.\nA minor planet discovered in May\n1972\nby  T M Smirnova at the Crimea Observatory was named after Ambartsumian\n(1905\nAmbartsumian\n)\n.\nOn Ambartsumian's\n80\nth birthday,\nSubrahmanyan Chandrasekhar\nwrote\n[\n12\n]\n:-\nThe only other astronomer of this century who compares with Academician Ambartsumian in his consistency and devotion to astronomy is Professor Jan Oort. ... There can be no more than two or three astronomers in this century who can look back on a life so worthily devoted to the progress of astronomy.\nAmbartsumian died on\n12\nAugust\n1996\nin Byurakan, and is buried next to the Grand Telescope Tower there.\nFor the first time in\n2010\n, the Viktor Ambartsumian International Prize was awarded. Set up by the President of the Republic of Armenia, the award is granted to those offering outstanding contributions in the field of astrophysics and in adjacent scientific fields such as mathematics and physics. It is awarded biennially, and until\n2016\n, was worth $\n500\n,\n000\n. At present\n(2018)\n$\n300\n,\n000\nis awarded with the Prize.",
