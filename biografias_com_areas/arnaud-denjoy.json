  "biografia": "Arnaud Denjoy\n's father, Jean Denjoy, was a wine merchant in Perpignan, which is in southern France about\n30\nkm north of the border with Spain. For a picture of the yard of 'Jean Denjoy Wholesale Wines, Perpignan', see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nArnaud's mother was Camille Henriette Maria Jayez; she came from Catalonia. Jean and Camille were married in Pavie in\n1880\n. Arnaud had an older sister Marie Antoinette Dejoy, born\n16\nÂ AprilÂ\n1881\n. Marie Antoinette married Auguste Henri Marie Pagnon\n(1878\n-\n1913)\non\n30\nNovember\n1901\nin Perpignan.\nArnaud was born and attended a secondary school in Auch which is the capital town of the Gers region in southwestern France. After attending the LycÃ©e d'Auch, Arnaud completed his schooling at the lycÃ©e in Montpellier, which is a city close to the Mediterranean coast in southern France. He remained associated with these regions throughout his life.Â At the lycÃ©e in Montpellier, Denjoy showed a great talent for arts subjects and his rhetoric teacher gave him the following advice: \"Denjoy, you have a lot of ideas for your age, don't do mathematics, you can become someone.\" Denjoy did not follow this advice and he took the special mathematics class which was designed to train pupils to sit the entrance examinations for the Ãcole Polytechnique and the Ãcole Normale SupÃ©rieure. Denjoy\n[\n8\n]\n:-\n... had, in the special mathematics class of Montpellier, a professor of mathematics whom \"the demands of logic made furious\"; so, with his fellow students, he had to learn from old courses and from books.\nAfter this somewhat deficient preparation he did not rank highly enough to enter the Ãcole Normale, being the best student to miss out on a place. He then had a stroke of luck, for one of the boys who had won a place pulled out and Denjoy was able to enter.\nIn\n1902\nDenjoy entered the Ãcole Normale SupÃ©rieure where he soon showed his relatively poor performance in the entrance examination did not match his remarkable abilities. He studied underÂ\nÃmile Borel\n,\nPaul PainlevÃ©\nand\nÃmile Picard\n. These great mathematicians gave Denjoy a strong background in complex function theory, continued fractionsÂ andÂ differential equationsÂ and set him on the road to his great discoveries. Denjoy enjoyed the highest success during his undergraduate years, being the top student in his class when obtaining the AgrÃ©gÃ© de mathÃ©matiques in\n1905\n. Remarkably, his first paper,\nSur quelques propriÃ©tÃ©s des fonctions de variables rÃ©elles\nâ\n(\nOn some properties of the functions of real variables\n)\n, appeared in the year he graduated. This is not a short note but rather it is a substantial\n17\n-page work published in the\nBulletin\nof the\nFrench Mathematical Society\n. Also in\n1905\nthe book\nLeÃ§ons sur les fonctions discontinuÃ©s: professÃ©es au CollÃ¨ge de France\nâ\n(\nLessons on discontinued functions: taught at the CollÃ¨ge de France\n)\nby\nRenÃ© Baire\nand Denjoy was published. On the title page\nBaire\nappears as a lecturer at the Faculty of Science at Montpellier, while Denjoy as a student at the Ãcole Normale SupÃ©rieure.\nBaire\nwrites in the Preface:-\nThe publication of these lessons was considerably facilitated for me by the assistance of one of my students, M Denjoy,Â who took on the task of writing it. I give him my thanks.\nDenjoy's success as an undergraduate was translated into the winning of a prestigious fellowship, the Fondation Thiers fellowship, which supported him for three years during which he worked on his dissertationÂ\nSur les produits canoniques d'ordre infini\nâ\n(\nOn  canonical products of infinite order\n)\nÂ which he submitted in\n1909\n.Â He wrote in\n1934\n[\n2\n]\n:-\n... during the previous year\n1908\n, I had taken sides in a controversy on the question, formerly raised by\nPainlevÃ©\nin his Thesis, namely the appearance of the functions of a complex variable, uniform throughout the plane, and provided with a completely discontinuous perfect set of singularities. I gave simple examples of a function remaining bounded on a set of finite positive length, then of a continuous function on a set of infinite length and zero area. On this occasion my attention and that of other Frenchmen turned to the properties of perfect planar sets which are totally discontinuous.\nHe had published the paper\nSur les fonctions entieres de genre fini\nâ\n(\nOn integer functions of finite genus\n)\nin\n1907\nand then three papers in\n1909\n:\nSur les fonctions analytiques uniformesa singularitÃ©s discontinues\nâ\n(\nOn uniform analytical functions with discontinuous singularities\n)\n;\nSur les fonctions analytiques uniformes qui restent continues sur un ensemble parfait discontinu de singularitÃ©s\nâ\n(\nOn the uniform analytical functions which remain continuous over a perfect discontinuous set of singularities\n)\n; and\nSur les singularitÃ©s discontinues des fonctions analytiques uniformes\nâ\n(\nOn discontinuous singularities of uniform analytical functions\n)\n.\nDenjoy's\n1909\ndissertation, although not considered by him as among his greatest achievements when he looked back on his career in\n1934\n, is now considered to contain some remarkable contributions. It studies the asymptotic behaviour of integral functions of finite order,Â\nWeierstrass\nproducts of integral functions and the boundary behaviour ofÂ conformal representations.\nFrom Paris, Denjoy moved back to Montpellier in\n1909\nwhen he was appointed \"Maitre des conferences\" at the University of Montpellier on\n14\nOctober. This post saw him preparing students for the \"agrÃ©gation\" examination and it was the same post in the same university to whichÂ\nBaire\nÂ had been appointed in\n1901\n.\nBaire\nhad left Montpellier before Denjoy took up this appointment, but he was an important figure in the development of Denjoy's mathematics. Denjoy was one of a small number of people who appreciatedÂ Baire's innovative ideas when he first produced them. For example whenÂ\nBaire\nÂ was told that what he taught was so difficult that it was beyond human ability to understand it, he wrote:-\n... but look atÂ DenjoyÂ - he understood it, hence it must not be so difficult ...\nWriting about his earlier work in\n1934\nDenjoy wrote\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nMy research was soon to take on a more personal and independent character. At the end of\n1909\nI ended my studies on perfect sets which were totally discontinuous planes and uniform analytical functions of which they constituted the only singularities. Nevertheless the theory of uniform functions of a complex variable pushed me towards the topology of the plane and particularly the study of the borders of regions where a function remains holomorphic\n(\na region which is connected and formed of interior points\n)\n. At this time the subject was dominated by the problem of giving a correct demonstration of Jordan's famous theorem on the division of the plane into two regions by any homeomorphic line at a circumference. Many childishly intuitive reasonings claimed to resolve the question. One could think of the grid of the plan, as\nJordan\nhad given the example for his measurement of sets. I observed that on the one hand the torus, on the other hand the surface with only one side, lent themselves to the grid and that any demonstration not invoking characters of the plane excluding the application of reasoning to the two varieties just cited could not be considered satisfactory.\nDenjoy taught at Montpellier until the start of World War I in\n1914\n. He suffered from poor eyesight so he was not fit for active military service during the war but he was mobilised in the auxiliary service. He wrote\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nIn\n1914\ncame the war, with four years of fighting, where science played a decisive role. As soon as the new map of Europe was adopted, as early as\n1920\nscientific studies, among other things mathematics, took off.\nHe appealed against his auxiliary military service and was allowed to take up a professorship at Utrecht beginning on\n1\nOctober\n1917\n. He had published some major works in the preceding couple of years which had shown that he was a world-leading researcher. For example there was the\n88\n-page paper\nSur les fonctions dÃ©rivÃ©es sommables\nâ\n(\nOn summable derivative functions\n)\nand the\n136\n-page paper\nMÃ©moire sur les nombres dÃ©rivÃ©s des fonctions continues\nâ\n(\nMemoir on numbers derived from continuous functions\n)\nin\n1915\n, the\n96\n-page paper\nMÃ©moire sur la totalisation des nombres dÃ©rivÃ©es non sommables\nâ\n(\nThesis on the totalization of non-summable derivative numbers\n)\nin\n1916\nand the\n58\n-page paper\nMÃ©moire sur la totalisation des nombres dÃ©rivÃ©es non sommables\n(\nsuite\n)\nâ\n(\nThesis on the totalization of non-summable derivative numbers\n(\ncontinued\n)\n)\nin\n1917\n.\nHenri Cartan\nwrites\n[\n8\n]\n:-\nAt the height of the submarine war,\n[\nDenjoy\n]\njoined his new post by sea, via England, and his boat was torpedoed twice. He then spent five of the most successful years in Utrecht, the memory of which he often enjoyed. It was the era of long bicycle rides along the canals and of collaboration with Julius Wolff\n(1882\n-\n1945)\n.\nHe was called to the Faculty of Science in Paris beginning in\n1922\n, first as a lecturer, then as an assistant professor, being promoted to full professor in\n1931\n, a post he held until he retired in\n1955\n. Not long after his appointment at the University of Paris, he married ThÃ©rÃ¨se-Marie Chevresson on\n15\nJune\n1923\n. Marie-ThÃ©rÃ¨se, the daughter of the tax collector Charles Marie Chevresson and Melanie FranÃ§oise Berthe Becker, had been born in Charleville-MÃ©ziÃ¨res\n(\nArdennes\n)\non\n26\nApril\n1892\n. They had three children, all sons: Jean Fabrice Denjoy\n(\nborn\n1\nJanuary\n1925)\n, who became a doctor of medicine and married Caroline-Adams Byrd; RenÃ© Denjoy\n(\nborn\n17\nSeptember\n1927)\n, who also became a doctor of medicine and surgeon; and Bernard Denjoy\n(\nborn\n23\nJune\n1926)\n, who became an architect and married Anne-Marie Roederer. We note that Denjoy asked\nNikolai Luzin\nto he godfather to RenÃ© Denjoy.\nLuzin\nsaid to Denjoy:-\nI heartily thank you for the honour and friendship you show me by choosing me as the godfather for your little RenÃ©. ... As you well know, christening has for me a profound meaning.\nLet us quote from Denjoy himself, writing in\n1934\n, about his work\n(\nsee\n[\n2\n]\n)\n:-\nMy luck was twofold: on the one hand, that the solutions to these problems waited for my coming, afterwards, that they appeared to me. Far be it from me to reduce the role of those who preceded me in this long ascent to the targeted summits. If the works of my predecessors, and those of M\nLebesgue\nwhich dominate them all, had not previously been smoothed out and marked out by hard and laborious stages, my starting base would have been undoubtedly too far from the goal for me to be able to reach that - by my only effort.\nHowever, the last step still to be crossed, and at the foot of which the previous attempts had stopped, was also not without serious difficulties to overcome. Now that the ridge is dominated, that we can measure its elevation, perhaps we will consider that the summit was still far from the extreme point previously reached.\nThe solutions that I have provided do not fit into the standard of classical mathematics. They have therefore been unequally appreciated.\nAll the mathematicians who embarked on the new paths of the theory of the functions of real variables, and who tested the conviction of penetrating into a world of truths illuminating a vast field of facts, all suffered from the feelings of indifference, of hostility, aversion to which their discoveries met with by scholars loyal to traditional studies. Everyone complained bitterly about it. I will not escape the common rule, although, in the face of the enormous development of modern Analysis, and the fruitful invasion of new ideas into the old fields which seem to be the most reserved, the prejudices of thirty or forty years ago are today much attenuated, it should fairly be recognized.\nWhat I would criticise for these unfriendly provisions with regard to the new disciplines is the spirit, insufficiently scientific in my opinion, from which they proceed. For me, mathematics requires the same objectivity as an experimental science.\nDenjoy worked on functions of a real variable in the same areas as\nBorel\n,\nBaire\nand\nLebesgue\n. He combined topological and metrical methods to attack problems of real analysis. In\n1934\nhe wrote that his greatest achievements had been the integration of derivatives, the computation of the coefficients of a converging trigonometric series, a theorem on quasi-analytic functions, and differential equations on a torus.\nThe second of these topics, computation of the coefficients of a converging trigonometric series, was the subject of a four volume workÂ\nLeÃ§ons sur le calcul des coefficients d'une sÃ©rie trigonomÃ©trique\nâ\n(\nLessons on the Calculation of the Coefficients of a Trigonometric Series\n)\nwhich appeared between\n1941\nand\n1949\n. The volumes were subtitled:\n1\n.\nLa diffÃ©rentiation seconde mixte et son application aux sÃ©ries trigonomÃ©triques\nâ\n(\nThe second mixed differentiation and its application to trigonometric series\n)\n;\n2\n.\nMÃ©trique et topologie d'ensembles parfaits et de fonctions\nâ\n(\nMetric and topology of perfect sets and functions\n)\n;\n3\n.\nDÃ©termination d'une fonction continue par ses nombres dÃ©rivÃ©s seconds gÃ©nÃ©ralisÃ©s extrÃªmes finis\nâ\n(\nDetermination of a continuous function by its finite generalized second derived numbers\n)\n; andÂ\n4\n.\nLes totalisations, solution du problÃ¨me de Fourier\nâ\n(\nSumming, solution of the Fourier problem\n)\n. These four volumes were an expanded version of work which had appeared in a series of papers by Denjoy beginning in\n1920\n. Included in these papers was his introduction of the Denjoy index for the points of a perfect set. Also in these papers is his introduction of the second symmetric derivative of a function. This work is studied in detail in\n[\n6\n]\nwhere Bullen makes the contents of Denjoy's work, which is not easy to read, more accessible to modern analysts.\nAlthough considered by Denjoy as one of his most important pieces of work in his\n1934\nreview,Â\nChoquet\nÂ writes in\n[\n9\n]\nthat these papers may be:-\n... considered more feats of intellectual strength than sources of practical applications.\nHowever,Â\nChoquet\nÂ describes the four volume workÂ\nLeÃ§ons sur le calcul des coefficients d'une sÃ©rie trigonomÃ©trique\nâ\n(\nLessons in calculating the coefficients of a trigonometric series\n)\nÂ which contains the famous Denjoy integral, as\n[\n9\n]\n:-\n... an explosion of beautiful theorems and examples.\nChoquet\n, very fairly, suggests that Denjoy's work on differential equations on a torus, not nearly so highly rated by Denjoy himself, is one of his most influential pieces of work and has\n[\n9\n]\n:-\n... grown into a vast field involvingÂ dynamical systems.\nSimilarly Denjoy's theorem on quasi-analytic functions has been the foundation of studies byÂ\nMandelbrojt\nÂ and has proved important in the development of large areas of current research.\nIn\n1946\nDenjoy published\nL'ÃnumÃ©ration Transfinie. Livre I. La Notion de Rang\nâ\n(\nThe Transfinite Enumeration. Book I. The Notion of Rank\n)\n.\nAlonzo Church\nwrites in a review\n[\n11\n]\n:-\nAddressed to mathematical analysts, this is a treatise on transfinite ordering, well-ordered series, and ordinal numbers, with attention primarily to the second number class. In an otherwise excellent work, the treatment of the axiom of choice, and of\nZermelo\n's theorem that every class can be well ordered, is without value, because the author mistakenly identifies the axiom of choice with the proposition that every non-empty class has a unit subclass. A second volume was already written in\n1942\nbut publication of it must still be postponed because of difficulties created by the war. The table of contents published in the present volume indicates that two appendices will contain more about\nZermelo\n's theorem, and some discussion of such matters as the Richard paradox, the relationship between effective definition and existence.\nL'ÃnumÃ©ration Transfinie\nâ\n(\nThe Transfinite Enumeration. Book I. The Notion of Rank\n)\nbecame a four volume work, the other three volumes being entitled: Vol. II/l.\nLes permutations spÃ©ciales\nâ\n(\nSpecial permutations\n)\n(1952)\n; Vol. II/\n2\n.\nLes suites canoniques\nâ\n(\nThe canonical suites\n)\n(1952)\n; Vol. III.\nEtudes complÃ©mentaires sur l'ordination\nâ\n(\nAdditional studies on ordering\n)\n(1954)\n; and Vol. IV.\nNotes sur les sujets controversÃ©s\nâ\n(\nNotes on controversial topics\n)\n(1954)\n. Rosalind Cecilia Hildegard Young, the eldest daughter of\nGrace Chisholm Young\nand\nWilliam Young\n, wrote\n[\n29\n]\n:-\nIn\n1942\n, the work purported to be a 'mise au point' in the standing controversy on transfinite numbers. In\n1954\n, it has to contend, besides, with the formidable inroads of axiomatism, described legitimately as scholasticism in the mathematical field. ... Without minimising the achievements of the axiomatic approach, Denjoy pleads for a return to descriptive notions in the theory of sets of points, and for an honest admission of what is actually 'thought' behind purely formal phraseology.\nDenjoy gave the lecture\nLe MÃ©canisme des OpÃ©rations Mentales chez les MathÃ©maticiens\nâ\n(\nThe Mechanism of Mental Operations in Mathematicians\n)\non\n25\nNovember\n1947\nat the Romanian Institute of Science and Technology. You can read a version of this lecture at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nIn\n1956\nDenjoy published\nUn Demi-siÃ¨cle\n(1907\n-\n1956)\nde Notes CommuniquÃ©es aux AcadÃ©mies. I La variable complexe\nâ\n(\nA Half-Century\n(1907\n-\n1956)\nof Notes Communicated to the Academies. I The complex variable\n)\n.\nWalter Hayman\nwrites\n[\n18\n]\n:-\nThis is a very stimulating book and evokes admiration for the author of so many fertile ideas in the theory of functions, varying over integral functions, quasi analytic functions, discontinuous perfect sets of singularities, Fuchsian groups, conformal mappings, and so on. Many of the ideas are merely sketched. This collection will be an inspiration to the young researcher in function theory, and ought to be required reading for him. He should, however, take care to scan the literature for the possibility that others also have worked in the same field, since the author's references to work other than his own are few and far between.\nGustave Choquet\nwrites\n[\n9\n]\n:-\nI heard him repeatedly regret not having read enough and thus having lost opportunities to broaden his mathematical horizon. It is true that he read very few mathematical publications, and almost exclusively the reprints that were sent to him. But the variety of his work in the most productive part of his life makes one doubt the correctness of this self-criticism; in fact his exceptional geometric intuition combined with his great power of concentration probably compensated for the rarity of his contacts with mathematical literature, and these two factors contributed to preserve his originality.\nLet us end by saying something of Denjoy's character. He was a quiet man, who liked to carry out his mathematical research in the peace of his own home. For leisure he enjoyed being in the countryside, particularly walking and cycling in wooded country. A relatively poor lecturer he was, nevertheless, a fine writer and an entertaining man with whom to hold a conversation.Â The following anecdote may not be true but it almost certainly contains a grain of truth. It concerns a visit Denjoy made to Columbia University on the early\n1950\ns:-\nAt one point, Denjoy was giving a lecture seriesÂ to an audience that began with a substantial number of subscribers but quickly frittered down to just three students. After a few more lectures, these three decided to go on strike, claiming that their situation was untenable. The entire department was in an uproar. Finally the strikers, after much urging, agreed to return to the lecture hall but on one condition: that Denjoy should cease lecturing in English and instead lecture in French.\nWe learn much of Denjoy's interests by reading his account of his trip to Rome in\n1908\nto attend the International Congress of Mathematicians. See\nTHIS LINK\n.\nWe note that he also attended the International Congress of Mathematicians in\n1920\nwhen he gave the lecture\nSur une classe d'ensembles parfaits en relation avec les fonctions admettant une dÃ©rivÃ©e seconde gÃ©nÃ©ralisÃ©e\nâ\n(\nOn a class of perfect sets in relation to functions admitting a generalized second derivative\n)\n, the Toronto Congress in\n1924\n, and the Bologna Congress in\n1928\nwhen his wife accompanied him. In\n1950\nhe attended the\n1950\nCongress in Cambridge, Massachusetts, giving the lecture\nLes permutations clivÃ©es\nâ\n(\nThe split permutations\n)\nin the Analysis Section on Saturday\n2\nSeptember. He was also the Honorary Chairman of the Conference in Analysis held on Friday\n1\nSeptember. In\n1954\nhe attended the Congress in Amsterdam, accompanied by his son Bernard Denjoy, and Bernard's wife. In\n1958\nhe attended the Congress in Cambridge, England and gave the lecture\nApproximation des nombres rÃ©els par ceux d'un corps fourni par un groupe fuchsien\nâ\n(\nApproximation of real numbers by those of a field supplied by a Fuchsian group\n)\n. At the Stockholm Congress in\n1962\nhe gave the lecture\nLes Ã©quations diffÃ©rentielles pÃ©riodiques\nâ\n(\nPeriodic differential equations\n)\n. Also, at the age of\n86\n, he attended the\n1970\nCongress in Nice, France.\nDenjoy was not a man lacking interests outside mathematics: on the contrary he was fascinated by topics such as philosophy, psychology, and social studies. He approached such topics from his position as an atheist and an active participant in socialist politics. In particular he was an active member of the Radical Party which was headed by Ãdouard Herriot. Although Denjoy did not aspire to the political career of Herriot, who served in nine different cabinets and was premier of France three times, Denjoy's involvement with the Radical Party led to him serving as a town councillor for Montpellier in\n1912\n, and as county councillor for Gers from\n1920\n. He served in this capacity for twenty years.\nFor his outstanding contributions to the theory of functions of a real variable, Denjoy received many honours. He was elected President of the\nFrench Mathematical Society\nin\n1931\n. As well as election to theÂ Geometry Section of the\nParis AcadÃ©mie des Sciences\nÂ on\n15\nJune\n1942\n, succeeding\nHenri Lebesgue\nwhose work he had extended, he was vice-president in\n1961\nand president in\n1962\n.\nHenri Cartan\nwrites\n[\n7\n]\n:-\nArnaud Denjoy presided over our Academy in\n1962\n. No one more than he was convinced of the need to reform it, so that in all scientific disciplines the most remarkable men of our country would be called upon to put themselves at the service of the Academy when \"They are still in the prime of life and in full activity.\" As President, he had submitted certain suggestions to the Academy, and it was a great disappointment to him to note that they had not resulted in any concrete decision. Hopefully the ideas he sowed will one day find the ground that will allow them to germinate and flourish!\nHe was also elected to the Royal Dutch Academy of Sciences, the\nPolish Academy of Sciences\n, and the Academy of Liege. He was elected an honorary member of the\nBelgium Mathematical Society\n; an honorary member of the\nMoscow Mathematical Society\n; an honorary member of the\nRomanian Academy of Sciences\n(1938)\n; an honorary member of the Boston Academy of Arts and Sciences\n(1939)\n; an member of the\nRussian Academy of Sciences\n; and an honorary member of the Lima Academy of Sciences. He was also honoured by being elected as vice-president of theÂ\nInternational Mathematical Union\nÂ in\n1954\n. He was awarded the Saintour Prize\n(1925)\n; the\nPoncelet\nPrize\n(1930)\n; the Petit d'Ormoy Prize\n(1933)\n; Albert\n1\nof Monaco Prize\n(1938)\n; and the Lomonosov gold medal\n(1970)\nfor outstanding achievements in mathematics.\nHe died aged\n90\nafter a fall in his home.",
