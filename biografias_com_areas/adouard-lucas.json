  "biografia": "Ãdouard Lucas\nwas educated at the Ãcole Normale in Amiens. After this he worked at the Paris Observatory under\nLe Verrier\n.\nDuring the Franco-Prussian War\n(1870\n-\n1871)\nLucas served as an artillery officer. After the French were defeated, Lucas became professor of mathematics at the LycÃ©e Saint Louis in Paris. He later became professor of mathematics at the LycÃ©e Charlemagne, also in Paris.\nLucas is best known for his results in\nnumber theory\n: in particular he studied the\nFibonacci sequence\nand the associated Lucas sequence is named after him. He gave the well-known formula for the Fibonacci numbers\n5\nf\nn\n=\n(\n1\n+\n5\n2\n)\nn\nâ\n(\n1\nâ\n5\n2\n)\nn\n\\sqrt 5 f_{n} = \\left(\\Large\\frac{1 + \\sqrt 5}{2}\\right)^{n}\\normalsize - \\left(\\Large\\frac{1 - \\sqrt 5}{2}\\right)^{n}\n5\nâ\nf\nn\nâ\n=\n(\n2\n1\n+\n5\nâ\nâ\n)\nn\nâ\n(\n2\n1\nâ\n5\nâ\nâ\n)\nn\n.\nLucas also devised methods of testing primality, essentially those used today. In\n1876\nhe used his methods to prove that the\nMersenne\nnumber\n2\n127\nâ\n1\n2^{127} - 1\n2\n1\n2\n7\nâ\n1\nis\nprime\n. This remains the largest prime number discovered without the aid of a computer.\nThe Lucas test for primes was refined by\nLehmer\nin\n1930\n. It works as follows. Define the sequence\nS\n2\n=\n4\n,\nS\n3\n=\n14\n,\nS\n4\n=\n194\n,\n.\n.\n.\nS_{2} = 4, S_{3} = 14, S_{4} = 194, . . .\nS\n2\nâ\n=\n4\n,\nS\n3\nâ\n=\n1\n4\n,\nS\n4\nâ\n=\n1\n9\n4\n,\n.\n.\n.\nwhere for\nn\n>\n2\n,\nS\nn\nn > 2, S_{n}\nn\n>\n2\n,\nS\nn\nâ\nis defined inductively by\nS\nn\n=\nS\nn\nâ\n1\n2\nâ\n2\nS_{n} = S_{n-1}^{2} - 2\nS\nn\nâ\n=\nS\nn\nâ\n1\n2\nâ\nâ\n2\n.\nThe Lucas-\nLehmer\ntest states that a\nMersenne\nnumber\nM\np\n=\n2\np\nâ\n1\nM_{p} = 2^{p} - 1\nM\np\nâ\n=\n2\np\nâ\n1\n, with\np\n>\n2\np > 2\np\n>\n2\n, is prime if and only if\nM\np\nM_{p}\nM\np\nâ\ndivides\nS\np\nS_{p}\nS\np\nâ\n.\nLucas showed that\nS\n127\nS_{127}\nS\n1\n2\n7\nâ\nis divisible by\nM\n127\nM_{127}\nM\n1\n2\n7\nâ\nthus showing that\nM\n127\nM_{127}\nM\n1\n2\n7\nâ\nis prime. This was a extremely difficult calculation since\nM\n127\nM_{127}\nM\n1\n2\n7\nâ\nis a big number and\nS\n127\nS_{127}\nS\n1\n2\n7\nâ\nis unbelievably large. In fact\nM\n127\nM_{127}\nM\n1\n2\n7\nâ\n=\n170141183460469231731687303715884105727\nand Lucas was only able to perform the calculation since he showed that\nS\n127\nS_{127}\nS\n1\n2\n7\nâ\nis divisible by\nM\n127\nM_{127}\nM\n1\n2\n7\nâ\nwithout calculating\nS\n127\nS_{127}\nS\n1\n2\n7\nâ\n.\nLucas is also well known for his invention of the Tower of Hanoi puzzle and other mathematical recreations. The Tower of Hanoi puzzle appeared in\n1883\nunder the name of M. Claus. Notice that Claus is an anagram of Lucas!\nSee\nTHIS LINK\n.\nHis four volume work on recreational mathematics\nRÃ©crÃ©ations mathÃ©matiques\nâ\n(\nMathematical recreations\n)\n(1882\n-\n94)\nhas become a classic.\nLucas died as the result of a freak accident at a banquet when a plate was dropped and a piece flew up and cut his cheek. He died of erysipelas a few days later.",
