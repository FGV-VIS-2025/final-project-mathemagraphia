  "biografia": "Tom Cowling\n's mother, Edith Eliza Nicholls, had trained as a teacher. His father, George Cowling\n[\n1\n]\n:-\n... was a highly intelligent person. His own father died young, and he had to start work at the age of\n14\nas an office boy at five shillings a week. He worked his way up, studying for examinations in the evening: After some years as a telegraph operator, he at age\n30\nwon his way into the Post Office engineering staff, where he finally reached the grade of executive engineer.\nGeorge and Edith Cowling had four sons, Thomas being the second. They were members of the Baptist Church\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nWith this background, we four naturally adopted what is often called the Puritan work ethic.\nThomas attended Sir George Monoux Grammar School at Walthamstow from\n1917\nto\n1923\n. His studies there were supported by a county scholarship. He writes in\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nThe Grammar school was strong on mathematics. This suited me, because I was fond of the subject ...; however, I was a slow and untidy writer, losing no opportunity of making blots and smudges. ... I was fascinated by chemistry but too clumsy to have made a success of experimental work.\nIn his sixth year at school he studied double mathematics, a little physics and\n(\nnon-examinable\n)\nFrench. He sat the mathematics scholarship examinations for Cambridge in December\n1923\nbut just missed out on an award. After working hard for the scholarship examination to Brasenose College, Oxford, he sat this in March\n1924\nand won a scholarship which was augmented by Essex County and the UK Education Department\n(\non the expectation that he would become a school teacher\n)\n. He entered Brasenose College in October\n1924\n, won a University Junior Mathematical Exhibition in\n1925\nand a Scholarship in\n1926\n. He graduated with First Class honours in\n1927\nafter a course which\n[\n1\n]\n:-\n... was old-fashioned and run inadequately by tutors who had other responsibilities too.\nHe did find\nHardy\n's lectures inspiring, but was attracted towards applied mathematics. The award of a three year postgraduate scholarship was a slight embarrassment given that the UK Education Department had funded him to become a school teacher. He therefore took a teaching diploma before undertaking research and although this did nothing for his subsequent career, it meant that by the time he was ready to undertake research E A\nMilne\nwas in post. He had approached\nMilne\nwhile in the middle of his diploma year, knowing he would arrive to take up his duties at Oxford in January\n1929\n, asking if he would supervise his research.\nMilne\nagreed on condition that Cowling work on an astronomical topic. It was, therefore, totally by chance that he began to undertake research in mathematical astronomy.\nMilne\ndid not have a problem in mind for Cowling to work on, so he asked\nChapman\nat Imperial College, London. Cowling found difficulties at first because of\nChapman\n's suggested approach, but soon adopted a different approach solving the problem. The result of this was that after Cowling completed his doctorate in\n1930\n,\nChapman\noffered him a position as a demonstrator in the Mathematics Department at Imperial College where he worked for three years before being appointed as an assistant lecturer in mathematics at Swansea University. While at Swansea he married Doris Marjorie Moffatt on\n24\nAugust\n1935\n; they had two daughters\n(\nMargaret Ann and Elizabeth Mary\n)\nand one son\n(\nMichael John\n)\n. After three years at Swansea, he was appointed as a lecturer in mathematics at Dundee\n(1937\n-\n38)\n, and then at the University of Manchester\n(1938\n-\n45)\n. Of course his time at Manchester pretty much coincided with World War II but he was not involved in technical war work\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nAccording to what I later heard, I was regarded as one who should not be entrusted with state secrets because I had unreliable associates. Thus I was left undisturbed to teach Applied Mathematics at Manchester University.\nHe did, however, have duties as an Air Raid Warden during the war.\nIn\n1945\nCowling was appointed Professor of Mathematics at University College Bangor, moving to a similar post in Leeds in\n1948\n. He remained at Leeds for the rest of his career, retiring from his duties in\n1970\nwhen he became Professor Emeritus. However he did suffer health problems long before he retired\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nDuring his time at Leeds the heavy load on a conscientious university professor with both departmental responsibilities and a commitment to scholarship took its toll; a series of health problems - a duodenal ulcer operation in\n1954\n, a slipped disk in\n1957\nand a mild heart attack in\n1960\n- caused a slowing down of his activities well before his retirement.\nCowling's main contributions were in the areas of stellar structure, cosmical magnetism, kinetic theory and plasma-physics. His first paper\nOn the radial limitation of the Sun's magnetic field\n(1929)\nactually criticised\nChapman\n's theory that the magnetic field of the sun had radial limitations. He showed in the paper that\nChapman\n's theory was inconsistent and showed that the field must have open field lines. Cowling's second paper\nOn a point-source model of a star\n(1930)\nbegan his publications on stellar structure. Certainly showing inconsistencies in\nChapman\n's theory of the sun's magnetic field did not hinder collaboration between the two men, and they published a major classic text\nThe Mathematical Theory of Non-uniform Gases\nin\n1939\n.\nBateman\nreviewed the book, indicating its contents and importance. After an introductory chapter the next:-\n... deals with the properties of a gas and some basic definitions and theorems. The equations of\nBoltzmann\nand\nMaxwell\nare then developed,\nEnskog\n's generalization of\nMaxwell\n's equation of transfer being given. The theory of molecular encounters is then presented. The next three chapters are concerned with\nBoltzmann\n's H-theorem, the Maxwellian velocity distribution, the free path, persistence of velocities and the elementary theory of the transport phenomena. In the important chapter on the non-uniform state for a simple gas, use is made of\nEnskog\n's method of solving the integral equation and of Burnett's calculation of certain quantities A and B with the aid of Sonine's polynomials. The non-uniform state for a mixture of gases is discussed in the next chapter. General expressions are first found and then formulae are obtained for special molecular models. The results of the analysis are of much physical interest and a large part of the book is devoted to the comparison of theory and experiment for viscosity, thermal conduction and diffusion. The appearance of the book is timely on account of the interest which is now being taken in thermal diffusion ...\nThe importance of the work is illustrated by the fact that a second edition appeared in\n1952\n(\nreprinted in\n1960)\nand a third edition in\n1970\nwhich was revised and reprinted in\n1990\n. Few books have such a long life!\nTo give an indication of the topics of Cowling papers we list a few from the first part of his career:\nOn certain expansions involving products of Legendre functions\n(1940)\n;\nThe non-radial oscillations of polytropic stars\n(1942)\n;\nThe electrical conductivity of an ionized gas in a magnetic field, with applications to the solar atmosphere and the ionosphere\n(1945)\n;\nThe oscillations of a rotating star\n(1949)\n;\nThe condition for turbulence in rotating stars\n(1951)\n;\nMagneto-hydrodynamic oscillations of a rotating fluid globe\n(1955)\n. In\n1957\nhe published another major text\nMagnetohydrodynamics\nwhich gave a concise account of the subject, making particular reference to applications in astronomy and geophysics.\nCowling received many honours throughout his career. He was awarded the Johnson Memorial Prize by Oxford University in\n1935\nfor original work in astronomy. Elected to the\nRoyal Society\nin\n1947\nhe was awarded their Hughes Medal in\n1990\n. Although the award was made two days before his death, sadly he did not learn about this prestigious honour. He was awarded the Gold Medal of the\nRoyal Astronomical Society\nin\n1956\n. He received this Medal from\nHarold Jeffreys\n. He was elected President of the Society for the years\n1965\n-\n67\n. In\n1985\nhe received the Bruce medal from the Astronomical Society of the Pacific.\nMestel writes in\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nEveryone knew Tom by sight; his red hair and his great height made him conspicuous. ... Most of us looked up to him also metaphorically because of his jestified reputation for kindliness combined with high critical standards, which he applied as strictly to his own works as that of others.",
