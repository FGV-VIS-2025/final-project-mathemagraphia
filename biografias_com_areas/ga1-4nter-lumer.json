  "biografia": "GÃ¼nter Lumer\nwas the son of Max Lumer\n(\nborn\n15\nApril\n1887)\nand Hedwig Hella\n(\nborn\n9\nMay\n1891)\n. He had a brother Walter Lumer. Max Lumer had an electrical wholesale business in Frankfurt an Main and he married Hedwig Hella in Frankfurt on\n30\nOctober\n1922\n. The family were Jewish and this presented them with great difficulties in\n1933\n. On\n30\nJanuary\n1933\nHitler came to power and on\n7\nApril\n1933\nclause three of the Civil Service Law provided the means of removing Jewish teachers from the universities, and of course also to remove those of Jewish descent from other roles. This did not directly affect Max Lumer, but it was clear to him that bringing up and educating Jewish children in Germany would present great difficulties. He moved his family to France in\n1933\nbut retained his electrical wholesale business in Frankfurt an Main where it remained listed until\n1937\n.\nIn France, GÃ¼nter Lumer was known as Guy Lumer and there he began his education. The biographies all show that the Lumer family fled from France in\n1941\nand emigrated to Uruguay to escape the Nazis after the fall of France. After the war ended, the Allies made an effort to document people persecuted by the Nazi regime. The American Zone in Germany recorded the German Jew Hans Lumer of Frankfurt an Main as one of those persecuted.\nLumer entered the University of Uruguay in Montevideo to study electrical engineering. This, of course, was a natural topic for Lumer, following the interests and expertise of his father.\nPaul Halmos\nheld visiting appointments at the University of Montevideo, Uruguay in\n1951\n-\n1952\n. Lumer, who studied mathematics as part of the electrical engineering course, attended lectures by\nHalmos\nwho tried to persuade him that mathematics and not electrical engineering was the subject for him.\nHalmos\nwrites in\n[\n8\n]\n:-\nGÃ¼nter Lumer was born in Germany, received some of his early education in France\n(\nwhere he was Guy Lumer\n)\n, and went to university in Uruguay\n(\nwhich was the permanent haven his parents found away from Hitler\n)\n. He spoke both German and French like a native, and Spanish almost as well. He is a short man, with a hooked nose, a wide grin, and a vivacious manner; he is always in motion. His size used to vary from normal to nearly obese so often that he needed two complete wardrobes, the fat one and the thin one.\nHis positive personality was visible even in his mathematical attitudes, even when he was a young student. What he was interested in at the moment was the most important problem in the world, and what's more he had just solved it - well, almost solved it - there is, you see, just this minor point that remains - is there a curve in the plane such that ... ? - and, great generalisation, is there a surface in space such that ... ? When I met him he was\n(\nwithout being aware of it\n)\na spiritual descendant of\nR L Moore\n. I took it to be one of my jobs to show him a window to the rest of the world of mathematics. I opened the window, I pointed, I argued - he closed his eyes, he resisted, he argued - and it all ended well. He was energetic and talented enough that it's not at all clear that I really did him any good; I am sure he would have become a mathematician no matter what I did.\n...\nLumer made a lot of small mistakes, kept correcting them, and converged to the truth by successive approximations. ... Lumer's stuff would come out structurally organised but chaotic in its details ... Lumer\n[\nwent on to do\n]\nhard\nHardy\nspaces in Belgium ...\nLumer was not the only student that\nHalmos\nencouraged to undertake research in mathematics while at the University of Montevideo. The other student was\nJuan Jorge SchÃ¤ffer\nwho, like Lumer was studying engineering and taking mathematics courses given by\nHalmos\n.\nHalmos\n, Lumer and\nSchÃ¤ffer\nwrote the joint paper\nSquare roots of operators\nwhich they submitted to the\nAmerican Mathematical Society\non\n4\nApril\n1952\n. The paper begins\n[\n9\n]\n:-\nIf H is a complex\nHilbert\nspace and if A is an operator on H\n(\ni.e., a bounded linear transformation of H into itself\n)\n, under what conditions does there exist an operator B on H such that\nB\n2\n=\nA\nB^{2} = A\nB\n2\n=\nA\n? In other words, when does an operator have a square root? The spectral theorem implies that the normality of A is a sufficient condition for the existence of B; the special case of positive definite operators can be treated by more elementary means and is, in fact, often used as a step in the proof of the spectral theorem. As far as we are aware, no useful necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a square root are known, even in the classical case of finite-dimensional\nHilbert\nspaces. The problem of finding some easily applicable conditions is of interest, in part because the use of square roots is frequently a helpful technique in the study of algebraic properties of operators, and in part because of the information that such conditions might yield about the hitherto rather mysterious behaviour of non-normal operators.\nIn\n1954\nHalmos\nand Lumer published a follow-up paper\n[\n10\n]\nwhich begins:-\nIt was recently shown that on an infinite-dimensional\nHilbert\nspace there exist invertible operators with no square roots. The main purpose of this paper is to show that there are many such operators. More precisely, we shall show that the operators with square roots are not even dense among the invertible operators, or, in other words, that there exists a nonempty open set consisting entirely of invertible operators with no square roots.\nDespite these excellent mathematics papers, Lumer was still studying electrical engineering at the University of Uruguay and he graduated in\n1957\nwith an engineering degree. He had, however, already made the decision to change to mathematics and had been awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in\n1956\nto enable him to undertake research for a Ph.D. in the United States. After his close working with Halmos, it is not surprising that Lumer went to the University of Chicago where\nHalmos\nwas working. At Chicago, Lumer's doctoral studies were supervised by\nIrving Kaplansky\nand he submitted his thesis\nNumerical Range and States in the Theory of Banach Space Operators\nin August\n1959\n. He gives the following acknowledgement in the thesis:-\nI wish to express my gratitude to Professor\nI Kaplansky\n, under whose guidance this thesis was written, for many valuable suggestions and discussions.\n(\nIt was in connection with a concrete problem proposed by Professor\nKaplansky\nthat I conceived of the present work.\n)\nI am also grateful to Professor\nP R Halmos\nfor his influence on my mathematical education and later work. Last, but not least, I wish to thank Professor\nI E Segal\n, Professor S Sternberg, and Dr A Koranyi for many helpful conversations.\nThe Introduction to the thesis begins:-\nThe theory that we shall develop extends the classical notions of numerical range\n(\nof an operator\n)\nand states\n(\non an algebra of operator\n)\nto the case of operators on any\nBanach\nspace. This provides one with new methods of attacking certain problems regarding the algebra of operator on a\nBanach\nspace, in which the structure of the underlying space comes in explicitly.\nWe should make it clear that Lumer had several papers published while he was an undergraduate in Montevideo in addition to those with\nHalmos\n, and also while he was in Chicago, such as:\nFine structure and continuity of spectra in Banach algebras\n(1954)\n,\nSets with connected spherical section\nÂ\n(\nPortuguese\n)\n(1955)\n,Â\nPolygons inscriptible in convex curvesÂ\n(\nSpanish\n)\n(1956)\n,\n(\nwith A Jones\n)\nA note on radical rings\nÂ\n(\nSpanish\n)\n(1956)\n,\nThe range of the exponential function\n(1957)\n,\nCommutators in Banach algebras\nÂ\n(\nSpanish\n)\n(1957)\n,\n(\nwith Marvin Rosenblum\n)\nLinear operator equations\n(1959)\n.\nLumer did not return to Uruguay but remained in the United States where he was appointed to a one-year position at the University of California at Los Angeles for\n1959\n-\n60\n. After this, he had another one-year appointment, this time at Stanford University for the academic year\n1960\n-\n61\n. On\n18\nMay\n1961\nhe married Linda Naim\n(1929\n-\n2009)\nin San Francisco, California. Linda, the daughter of Clement Naim and Aimee Mimoun, had been born on\n11\nFebruary\n1929\nin Tripoli, Libya into a Jewish family. After their marriage, the couple spent a honeymoon in France, flying back from Paris to New York on\n31\nJuly\n1961\n. GÃ¼nter and Linda had three children, the eldest being a son Marc Lumer born on\n11\nNovember\n1962\n. Marc became an author, illustrator and graphic designer.\nAfter these two one-year appointments, Lumer was appointed to the University of Washington where he worked from\n1961\nto\n1974\n. It was in\n1961\nthat Lumer published the result which today bears his name, the Lumer-Phillips theorem, which gives necessary and sufficient conditions on an operator to generate a strongly continuous semigroup of contractions on a general\nBanach\nspace. The result appears in the paper\nDissipative operators in a Banach space\npublished in the\nPacific Journal of Mathematics\nby Lumer and Ralph Saul Phillips\n(1913\n-\n1998)\n. Ralph Phillips was on the staff at the University of California at Los Angeles in the year that Lumer spent there and moved to Stanford University in\n1960\n, spending a second year with Lumer. The introduction to the paper begins as follows:-\nThe\nHilbert\nspace theory of dissipative operators was motivated by the\nCauchy\nproblem for systems of hyperbolic partial differential equations, where a consideration of the energy of, say, an electromagnetic field leads to an\nL\n2\nL_{2}\nL\n2\nâ\nmeasure as the natural norm for the wave equation. However there are many interesting initial value problems in the theory of partial differential equations whose natural setting is not a\nHilbert\nspace, but rather a\nBanach\nspace. Thus for the heat equation the natural measure is the supremum of the temperature whereas in the case of the diffusion equation the natural measure is the total mass given by an\nL\n1\nL_{1}\nL\n1\nâ\nnorm. In the present paper a suitable extension of the theory of dissipative operators to arbitrary\nBanach\nspaces is initiated.\nIn\n1962\nLumer attended, by invitation, the functional analysis conference in Oberwolfach, the research centre in the Black Forest in Germany. He spent the academic year\n1967\n-\n68\nat Strasbourg University. Heinz KÃ¶nig writes in\n[\n11\n]\n:-\nDuring the academic year\n1967\n/\n68\nGÃ¼nter stayed at Strasbourg University, thus close to my home University SaarbrÃ¼cken. In the summer term\n1967\nhe gave a series of lectures in SaarbrÃ¼cken, and in the winter term\n1967\n/\n68\n, which I spent at Caltech in Pasadena, a little bus supplied by our University brought my students to his lectures in Strasbourg every week. In the academic year\n1969\n/\n70\nGÃ¼nter Lumer together with Irving Glicksberg organised a Research Seminar on function algebras at their home University, the University of Washington in Seattle. I had the good fortune to participate for three months on his invitation.\nIn\n1973\nLumer moved from the United States to take up a permanent position in Europe at the University of Mons-Hainaut in Mons, Wallonia, Belgium. This university in the French community of Belgium had French as its official language. The university had only been founded a few years before, in\n1965\n, and in\n2009\n, five years after Lumer died, it became part of the University of Mons\n[\n12\n]\n(\nsee also\n[\n14\n]\n)\n:-\nHis scientific activities greatly contributed to the standing of the Belgian Universities in general and the University of Mons-Hainaut in particular. In\n1976\n, supported by the Belgium National Science Foundation, GÃ¼nter founded a contact group with the goal of organising research and exchange meetings in the fields of Partial Differential Equations and Functional Analysis. From the\n1990\ns on, building on the success of this group, GÃ¼nter became a driving force and leading contributor to several large-scale projects sponsored by the European Community. The resulting conferences on Evolution Equations  created a lasting network supporting international research collaboration. These activities, combined with GÃ¼nter's relentless energy and love for mathematics, were at the origin of the breath-taking development of the field of evolution equations and the theory of operator semigroups after the pioneering book of\nHille\nand Phillips from\n1957\n. In particular, between\n1992\nand\n1997\nhe co-organised the North West European Analysis Seminar  that was held in\n1992\nat Saint Amand les Eaux\n(\nFrance\n)\n, in\n1993\nat Schloss Dagstuhl\n(\nGermany\n)\n, in\n1994\nat Noordwijkerhout\n(\nThe Netherlands\n)\n, in\n1995\nat Lyon\n(\nFrance\n)\n, in\n1996\nat Glasgow\n(\nUnited Kingdom\n)\nand in\n1997\nat Blaubeuren\n(\nGermany\n)\n. Those seminars covered a broad range of topics in analysis and were a reflection of the true spirit of GÃ¼nter Lumer, who always enjoyed bringing together and working with a wide range of mathematicians and scientists.\nWe note that\n[\n12\n]\nlists\n109\npapers published by Lumer, the last being\nA general \"isotropic\" Paley-Wiener theorem and some of its applications\npublished in\n2003\n.\nIn\n1997\na serious hip joint operation reduced Lumer's mobility but he was able to continue with most of his mathematical activities. In addition to his work at the University of Mons-Hainaut, from\n1999\nto\n2005\nhe was on the staff at the International Solvay Institutes for Physics and Chemistry in Brussels. He continued working at both these until his death in\n2005\n. His wife Linda outlived him by five years and died in Brussels on\n19\nApril\n2009\n.\nThe Lumer Lectures were set up by the European Cooperation in Science and Technology Action CA\n18232\n, Mathematical Models for Interacting Dynamics on Networks. The series of Lumer Lectures\n[\n13\n]\n:-\n... is named after Gunter Lumer, a great mathematician with extensive achievements and a deep curiosity for applied functional analysis and operator theory, and is a joint scientific activity of all Action's Working Groups. The lectures will be delivered by carefully selected distinguished scientists whose research interests are related to our Action.",
