  "biografia": "Letitia Chitty\nwas the daughter of Herbert ChittyÂ\n(1863\n-\n1949)\nand his wife Mabel Agatha BradbyÂ\n(1865\n-\n1944)\n. Herbert Chitty, born\n13\nJanuary\n1863\nin Marylebone, London to Joseph William Chitty and Clara Jessie Pollock, became a barrister at law. He married Mabel Agatha Bradby on\n9\nAugust\n1890\n. Mabel Bradby, born\n2\nMay\n1865\nin Harrow on the Hill, Middlesex, was the daughter of Edward Henry Bradby, a clergyman and headmaster of Haileybury School, and his wife Ellen Sarah Johnson. Herbert and Mabel Chitty had three children: Christopher Chitty\n(1893\n-\n1953)\n; Letitia Chitty\n(1897\n-\n1982)\n, the subject of this biography; and Patience Penelope Chitty\n(1904\n-\n1988)\n. Several of the references give five children and name two other girls, Jessie Elizabeth Chitty and Helen Louisa Chitty. We cannot find any evidence for these two being Letitia's sisters, and certainly at the time of the\n1911\ncensus there are only three children in the family.\nIn\n1907\nHerbert Chitty, Letitia's father, became bursar of Winchester College but he had broad interests being also an antiquary and genealogist. Letitia, therefore, grew up in a well-off family; at the time of the\n1911\ncensus the family were living at\n51\nCampden House Road, Kensington, a house with ten rooms, and they had three servants, a nurse, a cook and a house parlour maid.\nLetitia was privately tutored and attended Kensington High School between\n1903\nand\n1916\n. This School had opened in\n1873\nas Chelsea School founded by the Girls' Day School Trust, in fact it was the first of the Trust's schools. It became Kensington High School in\n1888\nwhen it moved to Lytham House, St Alban's Grove, Kensington. This independent school was able to offer girls a high quality education and prepare them for university studies. When Letitia Chitty studied there the Head was Miss Ethel Home who filled this role from\n1900\nto\n1931\n[\n10\n]\n:-\nIn\n1900\nwe had the advantage of appointing as Headmistress Miss Ethel Home, a lady whose mathematical attainments are matched, as is so often the case, by an aptitude for music, which amounts in her case to genius, a word often misapplied, but here used appropriately.\nHaving gained from a strong mathematical education at Kensington High School, Chitty was admitted to Newnham College, Cambridge, inÂ\n1916\nto study mathematics. World War I had started in\n1914\nso Britain was at war when she began her studies. She took the examinations for Part I of the mathematical tripos in\n1917\nbut then was given leave to undertake war work with the Admiralty.\nAt the Admiralty Air Department she was involved in the development of aircraft. The first flight by the Wright brothers in\n1903\nhad only lasted a few seconds but the development was rapid and quickly the potential of aircraft for military use was realised. Soon after World War I began in\n1914\n, aircraft with guns were in combat. But the science was new and it was important to understand how materials acted to the stress of flying and the vibration caused by the propellers. She later recalled\n[\n8\n]\n:-\nThere were no programmes, no calculating machines ... we relied upon our slide rules and arithmetic in the margins ... Lives were at stake and we couldn't afford to let anything go through wrong.\nChitty worked at the Admiralty Air Department with Alfred John Sutton Pippard\n(1891\n-\n1969)\non a mathematical investigation of stress analysis for the experimental planes being built. She also worked with Richard Vynne Southwell\n(1888\n-\n1970)\nat the Admiralty Air Department. She impressed with\n[\n2\n]\n:-\n... her astuteness in research, and her capacity to see problems, work out solutions, and to apply her mathematical expertise to work in a creative but uncomplicated way.\nChitty found the work she was doing at the Admiralty Air Department to be exciting and she was encouraged to continue to work in this area by Pippard and others. After the war ended she returned to Newnham College, Cambridge, in\n1919\nbut rather than complete her degree by continuing to study the mathematical tripos, she decided to switch to the mechanical sciences tripos. She graduated with First Class Honours in\n1921\n, becoming the first woman to achieve this distinction. Perhaps we should indicate that to say she 'graduated' is not quite true since at this time women were not included in the degree ceremony lists, but simply received a certificate saying they were entitled to a titular degree of B.A.\nAfter her achievement at Cambridge, Chitty returned to work at the Air Ministry as a research assistant in\n1922\n. In the final stages of World War I, the Admiralty Air Department designed a heavily armed airship, the R\n38\n, intended to patrol and escort ships. When the war ended in\n1918\nconstruction had not started, but the R\n38\nwas built and sold to the United States Navy in October\n1919\n. A structural failure caused it to crash in August\n1921\nwith the deaths of\n44\nof the\n49\ncrew. Chitty worked as an assistant of Richard V Southwell for the Airship Stressing Panel which at that time was highly involved in the structure of the R\n100\nand R\n101\nairships, trying to make sure that the structural failure which had occurred with the R\n38\nwas not repeated. She also worked with Southwell on the theory of fluid flow and on the structure of frames, particularly those to support bridges. She published two papers co-authored with R V Southwell, namely\nOn the problem of hydrodynamic stability. I. Uniform shearing motion in a viscous fluid\n(1930)\nand\nA Contribution to the Analysis of Primary Stresses in the Hull of a Rigid Airship\n(1931)\n. The first of these has the following introduction:-\nExcept in a few very simple cases, the equations which govern the motion of a viscous fluid have so far defied analysis. Their difficulty comes mainly from the fact that they are not linear, so that the principle of superposition cannot be employed, as in many branches of mathematical physics, to construct solutions by the method of series or of singularities. For the same reason the flow pattern in the neighbourhood of a moving body must alter when the speed of the body is changed, and it follows that any exact determination of the pattern will be restricted to some definite speed. As a matter of fact, no precise determination of this kind exists, except in cases where the motion is indefinitely slow. But the form of the equations gives no reason for doubting the possibility of \"steady\" motion\n(\nin which the velocities are functions only of position\n)\nin every case of flow past fixed and rigid boundaries. Now in experiment it is found\n(\nunless the velocities are very small\n)\nthat eddying or periodic motions always occur. Thus the conclusion seems inevitable that a steady motion may become unstable as the rate of flow is increased, in the sense that accidental disturbances, if of suitable type, will persist.\nThe occurrence of eddies\n(\nor of \"turbulent\" motion\n)\nis intimately related with the important problem of the resistance of fluids, and it is therefore not surprising that the question of hydrodynamic stability has attracted much attention. Fairly obvious lines of investigation are suggested by the cognate theory of elastic stability. Starting from a known solution for steady motion, we imagine a disturbance to have been effected by some cause which it is not necessary to specify, and we examine, in the light of the general equations, the history of the disturbance after it has become \"free.\" The steady motion is judged to be stable if we can show that every disturbance, whatever its type, tends ultimately to vanish, and neutral or unstable if any type is found to persist or to increase. Since the general equations of motion are not linear, the question of stability may depend upon the scale of the disturbance; but if the disturbance is assumed to be infinitesimal\n(\nas is customary in elastic problems\n)\n, we may omit infinitesimals of the second order from the equations which govern the disturbed motion, and then the history of the disturbance\n(\nwithin the assumption stated\n)\nis independent of its magnitude.\nOn\n1\nOctober\n1933\nAlfred Pippard was appointed as head of the Civil Engineering Department at Imperial College, London and in the following year Chitty joined him in Imperial College when she became his Research Assistant\n[\n11\n]\n:-\nThus was resumed an association which began in\n1917\nand continued from\n1934\nuntil Pippard's death\n[\nin\n1969]\n.\nPippard had been impressed with Chitty when they worked together at the Admiralty Air Department and he had invited her to be his assistant at Imperial College. Also in\n1934\nChitty was elected a Fellow of theÂ Royal Aeronautical Society, the first woman to he awarded this honour.\nThe topics that Chitty worked on are perhaps best illustrated by listing some of the papers that she wrote jointly with Pippard over the next few years:\nThe stresses in a disk wheel under loads applied to the rim\n(1936)\n;\nThe mechanics of the voussoir arch\n(1936)\n; and\nOn an experimental method for the solution of plane stress problems\n(1936)\n. The 'voussoir arch' work was at the request of the Building Research Station and the paper begins:-\nIn spite of the antiquity of the voussoir arch and the extensive use to which it has been put, the theory of its behaviour never appears to have been adequately examined; although there is a considerable literature dealing with its design, the methods suggested are largely empirical and do not take into account the essential features of the mechanics of the structure. With the object of throwing some light on the problem and, if possible, of obtaining a more rational basis of design, work has been in progress for some time in the Civil Engineering Department of Imperial College of Science and Technology, and the present paper describes the results obtained during the first stage of the research.\nWorld War II began in\n1939\nand the Admiralty requested that she be allowed to work for them investigating stresses in submarine hulls resulting from explosions. The Ministry of Supply also called on her expertise to undertake both mathematical and experimental investigations while the Ministry of Home Security and theÂ BBC also sought her expertise. She was, however, still involved in research at Imperial College and took on a larger role there in\n1943\nwhen she was appointed as a Lecturer in Civil Engineering. Despite these extra duties, Chitty was still able to publish research papers during the war. For example with Pippard she published\nRepeated load tests on a voussoir arch\n(1941)\n,\nThe stresses in an extensible suspension cable\n(1942)\nand\nSome problems presented by cable bracing\n(1945)\n. She also published single author papers such as\nModern experimental methods in connexion with the design of statically indeterminate structures\n(1944)\n.\nIn\n1946\nPippard proposed Chitty for membership of the Institution of Civil Engineers. Given her publication record and the number of different organisations which had sought her expertise, she should have been welcomed into the Institution but, of course, there was a prejudice against women engineers which had to be overcome. There was also the problem that she had no higher degree. Pippard wrote:-\nMiss Chitty's work throughout a lifetime of research has been distinguished by its methodical approach, its thoroughness and meticulous accuracy and a lively appreciation of the needs of the designer.\nTwelve of Chitty's papers were included with the proposal and the fact that she had been awarded four Telford Premium Medals for papers co-authored with Pippard was noted. The proposal was successful and in\n1947\nshe became a fellow of the Institution of Civil Engineers.\nShe continued to publish important papers, for example a single authored paper\nOn the cantilever composed of a number of parallel beams interconnected by cross bars\n(1947)\nand with Pippard,\nExperiments on the plastic failure of cylindrical shells\n(1948))\n,\nThe effects of propping an arch\n(1948)\n,\nand\nA study of the voussoir arch\n(1951)\n.\nAnother major project that she undertook is described in\n[\n8\n]\n:-\nIn\n1951\nthe civil engineering firm of George Binnie was contracted the Iraq government to build the Dokan dam in a tributary of the Tigris river and asked Professor Pippard and Letitia Chitty to look at the stresses involved. They developed a stress analysis technique using relaxation methods and a rubber model to verify the design form, in an important on the conventional trial load method then in general use. Their work resulted in a single curvature arch dam of single curvature to suit the profile of the gorge.\nAlong with several co-authors, they published\nThe Experimental and Mathematical Analysis of Arch Dams, with Special Reference to Dokan\nin\n1956\n. She continued to work on several projects, particularly on dams for the Arch Dams Committee of the Institution of Civil Engineers. She presented her work on dams to the international symposium of the Institution on arched dams in\n1968\n. For the remarkable series of papers she had published, beginning in\n1936\n, and particularly for her work on dams, the Institution of Civil Engineers presented her with their Telford Gold Medal in\n1969\n[\n11\n]\n:-\nThe last meeting\n[\nAlfred Pippard\n]\nattended at the Institution of Civil Engineers, on\n21\nOctober\n1969\n, gave him particular pleasure. It was the occasion on which Miss Chitty received the Telford Gold Medal.\nIn fact Chitty had retired from her lectureship at Imperial College in\n1962\n. This did not prevent her continuing to work at the College and she was made a fellow of Imperial College inÂ\n1971\n. She was also an associate of Newnham College, Cambridge, fromÂ\n1927\nto\n1943\nÂ and then a second time fromÂ\n1958\nto\n1970\n.\nFrom the description of Chitty's career we have given above, it might appear that she devoted her entire energies to mathematical theory and to experimentation in civil engineering. There was, however, so much more that this remarkable person had to give\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nA colleague of Letitia's, Michael Carlile, remembers her eccentricities, in later life, such as carrying around a large shopping basket with a cat in it, sometimes it shared this with her knitting. She continued to attend the then annual University Teachers Christmas party for the children of staff on her own, long after her nieces and nephews had outgrown them: Letitia was still hugely entertained by the conjuring acts.\nYet she would attend the evening soirÃ©es at the Royal Institution and be fully engaged with the scientific discourse given at the meeting. She was fluent in seven languages, travelled greatly and had a wide interest in the arts and history, besides botany and was a great draughtsman.\nEarlier in her life, during World War II, she had combined her love of travel and of botany in writing the book\nAbroad. An alphabet of flowers. With Illustrations: a Book of Flowers and Travel\n, first published in\n1945\nwith a second edition in\n1948\n. Here is an example taken from the book:-\nDo you know that kind of flower vase which makes one think: \"What in the world could I put in this, which wouldn't at once look vulgar?\" Why vulgar, and what would it mean quite, I don't exactly know, and yet I've experienced that feeling and so, I expect, have you. Flowers are never vulgar, yet even flowers may fail to redeem the vase they are placed in and harmonise the whole.\nNow this was a blue and white vase which my mother had bought in Tarragona. It bore a very crude white ground, there was nothing refined or delicate about it, none of that delicacy associated with the pottery from Talavera, near Madrid. Still, surely something could be done with it. I just must see what I could do, so my father and I set out for a walk to do it.\nOf course there was no difficulty. It was local and knew what it was about, and a bunch of local wild flowers looked perfectly glorious and flamboyant in it: yellow Iris from the river, brilliant blue Anchusa, scarlet Poppies, and, to knit all together, great heads of gold green Spurge, or as the Botanists prefer, EUPHORBIA - great panicles\n(\nthat's the word\n)\nof golden yellow and green. The whole combination made a perfectly glorious vase of flowers which lit up and entranced our room.\nChitty also achieved fame outside the academic world, being interviewed by\nVogue Magazine\nin her later years. She died at the age of\n85\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nChitty, who did not marry, died onÂ\n29\nSeptember\n1982\nÂ at Ridgemead House nursing home, Englefield Green, Surrey, of senile myocardial degeneration and senile dementia, and was cremated at Woking crematorium. A memorial service was held at Holy Trinity, Prince Consort Road, London. Awards were created to commemorate her name and achievements at Imperial College and at Newnham College, Cambridge.",
