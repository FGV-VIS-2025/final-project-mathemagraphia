  "biografia": "Brian Kuttner\n's father was George Henry Kuttner\n(\nborn at Lukes, London about\n1878)\nwho was a manufacturing furrier. His mother was Lilian Frances Kuttner\n(\nborn in Stepney about\n1875)\n. Brian Kuttner had a younger brother Conrad Adolph  and sister Elsa Marion\n(\ntwins born\n1910)\n.\nBrian Kuttner attended University College School in London and from there he won a scholarship to study at Christ's College Cambridge. He graduated in\n1929\nand then continued to undertake research at Cambridge. Kuttner spent a while in GÃ¶ttingen studying with\nEdmund Landau\nand received his doctorate in\n1934\n.\nHowever, before the award of his doctorate Kuttner had been appointed in\n1932\nas an assistant lecturer at the University of Birmingham. At Birmingham Kuttner joined the Mathematics Department headed by\nG N Watson\n. He was to spend the rest of his career at Birmingham being promoted to lecturer in\n1936\n, Senior Lecturer in\n1952\n, Reader in\n1955\nand then to the chair of Mathematical Analysis in\n1969\n.\nKuttner's work was on\n[\n1\n]\n:-\n...\nFourier series\n, strong summability,\nRiesz\nmeans, NÃ¶rland methods, and Tauberian theory.\nMost of Kuttner's early work is on\nFourier\nseries and summability.\nHardy\nquotes some of these early results of Kuttner's in his treatise\nDivergent series\n(1949)\n. Maddox, in\n[\n1\n]\n, writes:-\n... at the age of only\n26\n, Kuttner proved a basic theorem in the general theory of trigonometric series, a result delightful for both the deceptive simplicity of its statement and the elegance of its proof. ...\nZygmund\ngreatly admired this theorem of Kuttner, which now occupies an honoured place in\nZygmund\n's monumental work on trigonometric series.\nThroughout his career he continued to publish a steady stream of high quality research papers right up to the time of his death. There was no signs that his output was decreasing when he retired, rather the reverse since the publication of\n8\npapers in\n1978\nindicates that his research activity increased after he retired from the Birmingham chair in\n1975\n.\nMathematical Reviews\nlists over\n120\nof his papers, and the continuation of joint papers appearing after his death show clearly that even into his\n80\ns his love for his favourite topics of analysis remained as strong as ever.\nKuttner's interests outside mathematics included travelling and walking. He regularly attended the annual\nBritish Mathematical Colloquium\nand I\n[\nEFR\n]\nremember him as someone held in great respect by my colleagues who were working in analysis when I began attending these Colloquia in the second half of the\n1960\ns.\nMaddox sums up Kuttner's many fine qualities\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nBrian Kuttner was a kind, helpful and gentle man, revered by his research students, admired by the numerous analysts who collaborated with him in research, and greatly respected by all who were fortunate to have known him.",
