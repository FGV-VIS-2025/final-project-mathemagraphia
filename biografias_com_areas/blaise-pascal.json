  "biografia": "Blaise Pascal\nwas the third of\nÃtienne Pascal\n's children and his only son. Blaise's mother died when he was only three years old. In\n1632\nthe Pascal family, Ãtienne and his four children, left Clermont and settled in Paris. Blaise Pascal's father had unorthodox educational views and decided to teach his son himself.\nÃtienne Pascal\ndecided that Blaise was not to study mathematics before the age of\n15\nand all mathematics texts were removed from their house. Blaise however, his curiosity raised by this, started to work on geometry himself at the age of\n12\n. He discovered that the sum of the angles of a triangle are two right angles and, when his father found out, he relented and allowed Blaise a copy of\nEuclid\n.\nAt the age of\n14\nBlaise Pascal started to accompany his father to\nMersenne\n's meetings.\nMersenne\nbelonged to the religious order of the Minims, and his cell in Paris was a frequent meeting place for\nGassendi\n,\nRoberval\n,\nCarcavi\n, Auzout,\nMydorge\n, Mylon,\nDesargues\nand others. Soon, certainly by the time he was\n15\n, Blaise came to admire the work of\nDesargues\n. At the age of sixteen, Pascal presented a single piece of paper to one of\nMersenne\n's meetings in June\n1639\n. It contained a number of\nprojective geometry\ntheorems, including Pascal's mystic hexagon.\nYou can see pictures of the\nMystic Hexagram\nat\nTHIS LINK\n.\nIn December\n1639\nthe Pascal family left Paris to live in Rouen where Ãtienne had been appointed as a tax collector for Upper Normandy. Shortly after settling in Rouen, Blaise had his first work,\nEssay on Conic Sections\npublished in February\n1640\n.\nPascal invented the first digital calculator to help his father with his work collecting taxes. He worked on it for three years between\n1642\nand\n1645\n. The device, called the Pascaline, resembled a mechanical calculator of the\n1940\ns. This, almost certainly, makes Pascal the second person to invent a mechanical calculator for\nSchickard\nhad manufactured one in\n1624\n.\nYou can see pictures of the Pascaline at\nTHIS LINK\nand at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nThere were problems faced by Pascal in the design of the calculator which were due to the design of the French currency at that time. There were\n20\nsols in a livre and\n12\ndeniers in a sol. The system remained in France until\n1799\nbut in Britain a system with similar multiples lasted until\n1971\n. Pascal had to solve much harder technical problems to work with this division of the livre into\n240\nthan he would have had if the division had been\n100\n. However production of the machines started in\n1642\nbut, as Adamson writes in\n[\n3\n]\n,\nBy\n1652\nfifty prototypes had been produced, but few machines were sold, and manufacture of Pascal's arithmetical calculator ceased in that year.\nEvents of\n1646\nwere very significant for the young Pascal. In that year his father injured his leg and had to recuperate in his house. He was looked after by two young brothers from a religious movement just outside Rouen. They had a profound effect on the young Pascal and he became deeply religious.\nFrom about this time Pascal began a series of experiments on atmospheric pressure. By\n1647\nhe had proved to his satisfaction that a vacuum existed.\nDescartes\nvisited Pascal on\n23\nSeptember. His visit only lasted two days and the two argued about the vacuum which\nDescartes\ndid not believe in.\nDescartes\nwrote, rather cruelly, in a letter to\nHuygens\nafter this visit that Pascal\n...has too much vacuum in his head.\nIn August of\n1648\nPascal observed that the pressure of the atmosphere decreases with height and deduced that a vacuum existed above the atmosphere.\nDescartes\nwrote to\nCarcavi\nin June\n1647\nabout Pascal's experiments saying:-\nIt was I who two years ago advised him to do it, for although I have not performed it myself, I did not doubt of its success ...\nIn October\n1647\nPascal wrote\nNew Experiments Concerning Vacuums\nwhich led to disputes with a number of scientists who, like\nDescartes\n, did not believe in a vacuum.\nÃtienne Pascal\ndied in September\n1651\nand following this Blaise wrote to one of his sisters giving a deeply Christian meaning to death in general and his father's death in particular. His ideas here were to form the basis for his later philosophical work\nPensÃ©es\n.\nFrom May\n1653\nPascal worked on mathematics and physics writing\nTreatise on the Equilibrium of Liquids\n(1653)\nin which he explains Pascal's law of pressure. Adamson writes in\n[\n3\n]\n:-\nThis treatise is a complete outline of a system of hydrostatics, the first in the history of science, it embodies his most distinctive and important contribution to physical theory.\nHe worked on conic sections and produced important theorems in projective geometry. In\nThe Generation of Conic Sections\n(\nmostly completed by March\n1648\nbut worked on again in\n1653\nand\n1654)\nPascal considered conics generated by central projection of a circle. This was meant to be the first part of a treatise on conics which Pascal never completed. The work is now lost but\nLeibniz\nand\nTschirnhaus\nmade notes from it and it is through these notes that a fairly complete picture of the work is now possible.\nAlthough Pascal was not the first to study the\nPascal triangle\n, his work on the topic in\nTreatise on the Arithmetical Triangle\nwas the most important on this topic and, through the work of\nWallis\n, Pascal's work on the\nbinomial coefficients\nwas to lead\nNewton\nto his discovery of the general\nbinomial theorem\nfor fractional and negative powers.\nIn correspondence with\nFermat\nhe laid the foundation for the\ntheory of probability\n. This correspondence consisted of five letters and occurred in the summer of\n1654\n. They considered the dice problem, already studied by\nCardan\n, and the problem of points also considered by\nCardan\nand, around the same time,\nPacioli\nand\nTartaglia\n. The dice problem asks how many times one must throw a pair of dice before one expects a double six while the problem of points asks how to divide the stakes if a game of dice is incomplete. They solved the problem of points for a two player game but did not develop powerful enough mathematical methods to solve it for three or more players.\nThrough the period of this correspondence Pascal was unwell. In one of the letters to\nFermat\nwritten in July\n1654\nhe writes\n... though I am still bedridden, I must tell you that yesterday evening I was given your letter.\nHowever, despite his health problems, he worked intensely on scientific and mathematical questions until October\n1654\n. Sometime around then he nearly lost his life in an accident. The horses pulling his carriage bolted and the carriage was left hanging over a bridge above the river Seine. Although he was rescued without any physical injury, it does appear that he was much affected psychologically. Not long after he underwent another religious experience, on\n23\nNovember\n1654\n, and he pledged his life to Christianity.\nAfter this time Pascal made visits to the Jansenist monastery Port-Royal des Champs about\n30\nkm south west of Paris. He began to publish anonymous works on religious topics, eighteen\nProvincial Letters\nbeing published during\n1656\nand early\n1657\n. These were written in defence of his friend\nAntoine Arnauld\n, an opponent of the Jesuits and a defender of Jansenism, who was on trial before the faculty of theology in Paris for his controversial religious works. Pascal's most famous work in philosophy is\nPensÃ©es\nâ\n(\nThoughts\n)\n, a collection of personal thoughts on human suffering and faith in God which he began in late\n1656\nand continued to work on during\n1657\nand\n1658\n. This work contains 'Pascal's wager' which claims to prove that belief in God is rational with the following argument.\nIf God does not exist, one will lose nothing by believing in him, while if he does exist, one will lose everything by not believing.\nWith 'Pascal's wager' he uses probabilistic and mathematical arguments but his main conclusion is that\n...we are compelled to gamble...\nHis last work was on the cycloid, the curve traced by a point on the circumference of a rolling circle. In\n1658\nPascal started to think about mathematical problems again as he lay awake at night unable to sleep for pain. He applied\nCavalieri\n's calculus of indivisibles to the problem of the area of any segment of the cycloid and the centre of gravity of any segment. He also solved the problems of the volume and surface area of the solid of revolution formed by rotating the cycloid about the x-axis.\nPascal published a challenge offering two prizes for solutions to these problems to\nWren\n, LaloubÃ¨re,\nLeibniz\n,\nHuygens\n,\nWallis\n,\nFermat\nand several other mathematicians.\nWallis\nand LaloubÃ¨re entered the competition but LaloubÃ¨re's solution was wrong and\nWallis\nwas also not successful.\nSluze\n,\nRicci\n,\nHuygens\n,\nWren\nand\nFermat\nall communicated their discoveries to Pascal without entering the competition.\nWren\nhad been working on Pascal's challenge and he in turn challenged Pascal,\nFermat\nand\nRoberval\nto find the arc length, the length of the arch, of the cycloid.\nPascal published his own solutions to his challenge problems in the\nLetters to Carcavi\n. After that time on he took little interest in science and spent his last years giving to the poor and going from church to church in Paris attending one religious service after another.\nPascal died at the age of\n39\nin intense pain after a malignant growth in his stomach spread to the brain. He is described in\n[\n3\n]\nas:-\n... a man of slight build with a loud voice and somewhat overbearing manner. ... he lived most of his adult life in great pain. He had always been in delicate health, suffering even in his youth from migraine ...\nHis character is described as:-\n... precocious, stubbornly persevering, a perfectionist, pugnacious to the point of bullying ruthlessness yet seeking to be meek and humble ...\nIn\n[\n1\n]\nthe following assessment is given:-\nAt once a physicist, a mathematician, an eloquent publicist in the Provinciales ... Pascal was embarrassed by the very abundance of his talents. It has been suggested that it was his too concrete turn of mind that prevented his discovering the\ninfinitesimal\ncalculus, and in some of the Provinciales the mysterious relations of human beings with God are treated as if they were a geometrical problem. But these considerations are far outweighed by the profit that he drew from the multiplicity of his gifts, his religious writings are rigorous because of his scientific training...",
