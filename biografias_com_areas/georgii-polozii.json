  "biografia": "Georgii Nikolaevich Polozii\nwas the son of Nikola Andriyovych Polozii and Olena Hryhorivna Sviatkina. We note that his name appears with many different spellings depending of the transliteration. For example, Polozii is often written Polozhii or Polozhiy. His patronymic name Nikolaevich appears in various spelling, but perhaps the most confusing is Mikolaevich meaning that often his name appears as G N Polozii or G M Polozii. In fact some of his mathematical papers have the author's name as G N Polozii, while others have G M Polozii.\nGeorgii Nikolaevich's paternal grandfather had been forced to move to the village of Kapustin Yar on the Astrakhan steppes after the Russo-Turkish war of\n1877\n-\n1878\n. Georgii Nikolaevich's father, one of eighteen children, became a telegraph operator on the Trans-Siberian railway. At the time that his son Georgii Nikolaevich was born, he was working at the\n37\nth junction of the Trans-Baikal railway, a part of the Trans-Siberian railway built between\n1895\nand\n1905\n. This was in the Chita region, east of Lake Baikal, about\n900\nkm from Irkutsk, the first large city one reaches travelling west along the Trans-Siberian railway from Chita. Nikola Andriyovych and Olena Hryhorivna had five children, four girls and one son, Georgii Nikolaevich, the subject of this biography. He was the youngest of the five children.\nWhen Georgii Nikolaevich was ten years old, in\n1924\n, the Polozii family moved to the village of Nizhny Baskunchak\n(\nLower Baskunchak\n)\nin the Astrakhan region, where some of their relatives lived. Nizhny Baskunchak is a small rural village on the west shore of the saline Lake Baskunchak and Georgii Nikolaevich attended school there. To complete his school education, however, he had to leave his family and move to the village of Verkhny Baskunchak\n(\nUpper Baskunchak\n)\nabout\n8\nkm west of Nizhny Baskunchak. There he could study at the Verkhny Baskunchak Secondary School from which he graduated in\n1931\nwith a Certificate which stated that:-\nDuring his stay at the school he found a special inclination for physical and mathematical sciences.\nPolozii would have wished to continue immediately to university studies but this was not allowed at that time before obtaining work experience. The largest employer in Nizhny Baskunchak was the Bassol plant for the extraction of salt from Lake Baskunchak and processing it. The company's products included table salt, iodized salt and industrial salt. He worked in management at the Bassol plant until January\n1933\n, then in the following month he enrolled as a first-year student in the Faculty of Physics and Mathematics of Saratov State University which had been founded in\n1919\n. He was taught by Georgy Petrovich Boev who had a huge influence on Polozii's development as a teacher, mathematician and scientist. To understand this influence let us look briefly at Boev's methods of teaching as described by B V Gnedenko, who was also taught by Boev at Saratov State University, in\n[\n5\n]\n:-\n[\nBoev\n]\nbased his approach on the premise that mathematics for engineers was not an end in itself but a means of studying engineering subjects and a method to be applied in future practical work. Therefore, mathematicians must teach what is necessary for the student and must present the material in such a way as to show him why he is studying it. But in order to understand which mathematical methods and corresponding solutions are required by specialists\n[\nin a given field\n]\n, mathematicians themselves must study some of the field's basic features and its important problems.\nWhile still an undergraduate, Polozii showed his ability to do scientific and mathematical analysis so, after he graduated in\n1937\nwith the highest honours, he was appointed as an assistant at the Department of Mathematics of the Saratov Highway Institute. He began to undertake research but was not in a position to have advice from a well-qualified advisor. He wrote some notes based on his first research attempts and sent them to Mstislav Vsevolodovich Keldysh hoping that they might be worth publishing in the\nDoklady Akademii Nauk SSSR\n. They were rejected by M V Keldysh who wrote the following to Polozii on\n12\nDecember\n1937\n(\nsee\n[\n12\n]\n)\n:-\nThe results of your work can be obtained almost directly from Schwartz's lemma ... and so, because of the simplicity with which the results of the note can be obtained, it should not be published in 'Doklady Akademii Nauk'. However, the wording of your note is of interest in addition to the facts presented and, after simplification of the proofs, they could be published in the section of small notes ... . I sent your three notes on the theory of filtration to Pelageia Yakovlevna Kochina with a request to review them and give feedback. She is an expert in these matters. Upon receipt of her opinions, I will inform you about them. It would be nice if you came to Moscow on vacation in order to discuss the issues related to preparing your dissertation. Then I will give you the literature you are interested in.\nThese notes were never published, but the connection that was made between Polozii, M V Keldysh and P Ya Kochina proved highly significant and, eventually, M V Keldysh would become Polozii's advisor for his doctoral dissertation. Polozii was appointed as an assistant at the Department of Mathematical Analysis of Saratov State University, where he became actively engaged in research. His studies were interrupted, however, by the country becoming involved in major wars. In AugustÂ\n1939\n, Russia and Germany had signed a secret pact, the so-called Ribbentrop-Molotov pact, to divide Poland between them. Soviet troops invaded Poland onÂ\n17\nÂ September\n1939\nand byÂ\n29\nÂ September Poland was partitioned between Russia and Germany. The Ribbentrop-Molotov pact also gave Soviet forces the freedom to invade the Baltic States with German agreement not to oppose this, but the pact was not known at the time. In September-OctoberÂ\n1939\nÂ the Soviets pressured the Baltic States to allow them to set up military bases there. On\n30\nNovember\n1939\nthe Soviet Union invaded Finland resulting in what is now known as the Winter War. Despite superior military strength, the Soviets made little progress. On\n1\nFebruary\n1940\n, Polozii went to the front as a volunteer but, following the Moscow Peace Treaty in March\n1940\n, fighting ended and a few months later, on\n11\nNovember\n1940\n, Polozii returned to Saratov State University.\nAt this stage the Ribbentrop-Molotov pact meant life in the Soviet Union was relatively normal but this changed dramatically onÂ\n22\nÂ JuneÂ\n1941\nÂ when Germany broke the non-aggression pact and invaded the Soviet Union. Two days later, on\n24\nJune\n1941\n, Polozii again volunteered for the front to fight in what became known as the Great Patriotic War. He was in the infantry, had the rank of junior lieutenant and became commander of a rifle platoon. On\n3\nSeptember\n1941\nhe was wounded near the village of Mykhailivsky, but returned to the front after treatment. Much more serious, however, was the wounds he received on\n22\nFebruary\n1942\nin the fighting against the invasion by the German army near Nelidovo, Nelidovsky District, Kalinin region. He spent two years being treated for his injuries, during which time he underwent seven operations. At the beginning of\n1944\nhe was declared unfit for further military service and he returned to Nizhny Baskunchak.\nPolozii, now disabled, was faced with difficult decisions. He had to decide whether to attempt to return to his mathematical career or to try to make his way in a different profession, perhaps one in which his disabilities would be less of a hinderance. He turned for advice to his former professor Georgy Petrovich Boev who strongly supported his return to an academic career. With Boev's support, on\n6\nApril\n1944\nPolozii was appointed as an assistant in the Department of Mathematical Analysis of Saratov State University. He only had a first degree and to make a career as a professor he had to first obtain a Candidate's Degree, equivalent to a Ph.D., and then a doctorate, essentially equivalent to the\nhabilitation\n. The first step was the Candidate's degree and he began working for that advised by G P Boev. In October\n1944\nhe was promoted to a position equivalent to a senior lecturer or associate professor.\nIn\n1946\nPolozii defended his doctoral dissertation\nIntegral Representations of Continuously Differentiable Functions of a Complex Variable\n(\nRussian\n)\nin which he had begun to develop a new approach to generalised analytic functions. In this dissertation he was the first to establish the Cauchy formula for\n(\np\n,\nq\n)\n(p, q)\n(\np\n,\nq\n)\n-analytic functions. Let us quote from\n[\n1\n]\nat this point:-\nThe following results, obtained by G N Polozii and which are the basis of the whole theory of\n(\np\n,\nq\n)\n(p, q)\n(\np\n,\nq\n)\nanalytic functions, indicate the close structural and qualitative connection of these functions with the classical theory of families of solutions of the Cauchy-Riemann system:\nThe concept of an integral with respect to the conjugate variable, and the introduction of a differentiation operation inverse to the operation of integration with respect to the conjugate variable.\nThe concept of conjugate kernels and the construction of a generalised Cauchy integral and a generalised Cauchy-type integral; the differential properties of\n(\np\n,\nq\n)\n(p, q)\n(\np\n,\nq\n)\n-analytic functions.\nThe classification of isolated singularities, and the fundamental theorem on residues.\nThe properties of uniqueness and\n(\np\n,\nq\n)\n(p, q)\n(\np\n,\nq\n)\n-continuation of\n(\np\n,\nq\n)\n(p, q)\n(\np\n,\nq\n)\n-analytic functions; isolation of the roots of the equation\nf\n(\nz\n)\n=\nA\n=\nconst\nf(z) = A = \\text {const}\nf\n(\nz\n)\n=\nA\n=\nconst\n.\nTheorems on conservation of the domain and congruence of the boundaries; theorem on the conservation of a Schlicht neighbourhood.\nWe have listed papers by Polozii at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nWe have listed books by Polozii at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nWe note that the five results quoted above appear in the papers\n1\n.,\n3\n., and\n12\n. in our list of Polozii's papers. They are all discussed in Polozii's book\nThe Method of Summary Representation for Numerical Solution of Problems of Mathematical Physics\n(\nPergamon Press,\n1965)\n. This book is\n5\n. on our list of Polozii's books where we give its preface, introduction and extracts from some reviews.\nIn\n1949\nPolozii was appointed to the Taras Shevchenko NationalÂ University of Kyiv as an associate professor of mathematical analysis. This university, founded in\n1834\nas the Saint Vladimir Royal University, had been the Mykhailo Drahomanov University from\n1920\nto\n1932\n, before being renamed the Taras Shevchenko University of Kyiv in\n1939\n. After one year, he was appointed associate professor of mathematical physics, holding this position for the year\n1950\n-\n51\n. He became Head of the Department of Mathematical Physics in October\n1951\n. The previous Head of the Department of Mathematical Physics at Kyiv had been Nikolai Nikolaevich Bogolyubov but he left to take up the position of Head of the Department of Theoretical Physics, a new department, in the Steklov Mathematical Institute in Moscow. From November\n1952\nto February\n1953\nPolozii served as dean of the Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics at the University of Kyiv.\nAlthough Polozii was Head of the Department of Mathematical Physics, he was not a professor; that would only be possible after he had obtained a doctorate. On\n25\nJune\n1953\nhe defended his doctoral dissertation\nOn some methods of function theory in continuum mechanics\nwhich he defended at the Steklov Mathematical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR. His opponents were Mikhail Alekseevich Lavrentev and Pelageia Yakovlevna Polubarinova Kochina. Lavrentev wrote in his report on the dissertation:-\nThe author gives a solution to the classical theory of mixed elasticity, when normal displacements and tangential stresses are put on the boundary. The problem is solved for a polygonal region. This problem attracted the attention of many who work on elasticity, but the complete solution has only been obtained in the work of G N Polozii.\nKochina wrote in her report that:-\n... there is a group of problems associated with the mathematical theorem of G N Polozii, on the motion of boundary points. This theorem itself is elegant and is of mathematical interest, and there is already further work developing from it. And on the other hand, it is very useful in filtration theory, because it allows one to give estimates of some quantities of immediate interest.\nAfter the award of his doctorate, Polozii received the title 'Professor of Mathematical Physics' in\n1954\n. From that time, he began to work to ensure the creation of a Computing Centre at Kyiv University, which he successfully acomplished. During this period, the USSR began to pay considerable attention to the development of computational mathematics and in many higher education institutions began to create departments of computational mathematics. In December\n1957\n, the Department of Computational Mathematics was established in the Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics of the University of Kyiv. The composition of the department was formed of the best young teachers of other departments in the Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics and talented scientists from other scientific institutions. The rector of the University appointed Pavel Stepanovich Bondarenko as temporary head of the new Department while a competition was set up to select a permanent head. Polozii was chosen as the first permanent head of the new Department taking up the post in\n1958\n. He continued in this position until his death in\n1968\n.\nWe have already seen Polozii's major pure mathematical contributions but let us summarise his contribution: the theory of functions of a complex variable, approximation theory, and numerical analysis. He also made major contributions to mathematical physics and applied mathematics, in particular working on the theory of elasticity. Between\n1962\nand\n1966\nPolozii developed the theory for a new class of\n(\np\n,\nq\n)\n(p, q)\n(\np\n,\nq\n)\nanalytic functions. Petryshyn, writing in\n[\n7\n]\n, summarises Polozii's work:-\nOriginal results in the theory of functions of a complex variable were obtained in the\n1950\ns and\n1960\ns by G Polozii of Kyiv, who introduced a new notion of\np\np\np\n-analytic functions, defined the notion of derivative and integral for these functions, developed their calculus, obtained a generalised Cauchy formula, and devised a new approximation method for solution of problems in elasticity and filtration. His results were further developed by his students ...\nIn approximation theory Polozii worked mainly with the aim of developing effective methods to solve\nboundary value problems\nwhich arise in mathematical physics. His work here produced the method of summary representation. Let us quote from\n[\n6\n]\nwhere the work of Polozii and his Department in this area is put into a broad context. One of the main areas of research in the Department of Computational Mathematics was:-\n... approximate methods for solving problems of mathematical physics. Almost all modern mathematical methods used to solve the most interesting of scientific and technical problems, both from a theoretical and, especially, from a practical point of view, are methods of finding an approximate solution of the problem. These methods are divided into two groups - analytical and numerical. The first makes it possible to obtain a solution in the form of a formula that allows for its qualitative analysis. But, unfortunately, analytical methods are developed only for a relatively narrow range of fairly simple problems that very seldom reproduce real processes. More accurate and, consequently, more complex mathematical models are implemented by numerical methods. The latter give a solution only at certain points in the scope of the problem, and this is the main disadvantage of numerical methods. In addition, classical numerical methods work only in limited areas of problem definition. But these shortcomings could not cover the significant advantages of numerical methods in comparison with analytical: applicability to an incomparably wider range of tasks and the relative ease of implementation, especially with the help of computers. Apparently, every qualified mathematician who has worked and is working with approximate methods has been thinking about how to combine the positive properties of analytical and numerical methods. For the boundary value problems of the equations of mathematical physics there is a model which established these processes; this was created by G M Polozii and his students and followers. The method of summary images developed by him\n(\nor, as it is also called, the method of\nP\nP\nP\n-transformations\n)\nmade it possible to construct solutions of the corresponding finite-difference problems in a closed form and to write them in the form of formulas of summary images. Depending on the type of boundary conditions, these formulas are either explicit or determined by a small number of unknown parameters. These parameters can be calculated by solving the corresponding system of linear algebraic equations. Another feature of the method should be noted: it is ideal for implementation on a computer with parallel processing. In this respect, the fate of the method is reminiscent of the fate of the fast Fourier transform, which was discovered in\n1925\n, but was most widely used only with the widespread use of computers. Both of these methods were ahead of their time. Georgii Nikolaevich himself developed only the theoretical foundations of the method of summary images, and his students were engaged in the practical implementation of these developments and its further improvement.\nMore details of Polozii's mathematical contributions are given in the obituary which you can read at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nAmong the many honours given to Polozii, let us mention his election as a corresponding member of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences in\n1967\nand several USSR medals and awards, for example in\n1959\nand\n1964\n.\nOver the last years of his life, Polozii worked to create a Faculty of Computational Mathematics and Cybernetics. Sadly he died at the age of\n54\nonly a year before this Faculty was established. He was buried in Kyiv at Baykovo Cemetery.\nThe conference 'Differential Equations, Computational Mathematics, Function Theory and Mathematical Methods of Mechanics' was held at the Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics of Kyiv University on\n23\n-\n24\nApril\n2014\nto celebrate the centenary of Polozii's birth.",
