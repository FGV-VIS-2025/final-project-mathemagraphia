  "biografia": "After being educated in his home town,\nZyoiti Suetuna\nmoved to Tokyo in\n1916\nwhen he began to study at the First High School. Certainly his talents had been recognised at his local school for the First High School was only designed for the most talented pupils to finish their school education before entering university. At the First High School Suetuna's mathematical talents became clear to his teachers and in\n1919\nhe entered Tokyo University to take a degree in mathematics.\nThis was an exciting period to study at Tokyo University for\nTakagi\npublished his famous paper on class field theory in\n1920\n. When Suetuna was in his final undergraduate year his studies were supervised by\nTakagi\nand this inspired Suetuna to work on number theory. He graduated from Tokyo University in\n1922\nand was appointed as a lecturer at Kyushu University. While he was there he read\nEdmund Landau\n's two volume work on the distribution of the primes and then began to read the papers of\nHardy\nand\nLittlewood\nwhich were being published at that time. In particular he read\nHardy\nand\nLittlewood\n's paper\nThe approximate functional equation in the theory of the zeta function with applications to the divisor problems of Dirichlet and Piltz\nwhich appeared in the\nProceedings of the London Mathematical Society\n. This paper formed the basis for the first sixteen of Suetuna's papers which were on\nL\nL\nL\n-functions\n(\ngeneralisations of the\nzeta function\n)\nand appeared from\n1924\nup to\n1931\n.\nSuetuna taught for two years at Kyushu University, being promoted to associate professor during that period, then returned to Tokyo University in\n1924\n. In\n1927\nSuetuna went to study in Europe, in particular spending two years at GÃ¶ttingen with\nLandau\n's school. While there he became particularly interested in the work on the foundations of mathematics which was being studied by\nHilbert\n's school. He attended lectures by\nBernays\non the foundations of mathematics during his stay in GÃ¶ttingen. Another active research group in GÃ¶ttingen at this time was the algebra group led by\nEmmy Noether\n. The style of mathematical research carried out by this group with its lively discussion seminars impressed Suetuna so much that he went on to introduce this research style to Japan on his return.\nNow\n1927\n, the year Suetuna went to Europe, was the one in which\nArtin\npublished his general reciprocity law which in some sense completed the proofs of the ideas\nTakagi\nhad introduced in\n1920\n. Suetuna was fascinated by this result of\nArtin\nand he went to Hamburg in\n1929\nto study with him.\nHasse\nwas also proving important results in this area and Suetuna collaborated with\nHasse\nvisiting him in Halle in\n1929\nto complete work on their joint paper\nA general divisor problem\n.\nThe European trip had been extremely productive for Suetuna and when he returned to Tokyo University in\n1931\nhe had gained greatly from the experience. One purpose of his visit had been to learn probability and statistics, for these topics did not have active researchers in Japan at this time and Tokyo University had sent him to Germany to gain expertise in these areas. Suetuna did not spent a great deal of time attending lectures on\nprobability\nand statistics, preferring to work on his own research topics. However he did read books on probability and statistics while in Germany and by the time he returned to Japan he had gained considerable expertise in probability and statistics despite concentrating on his research topics in algebra and number theory.\nBack in Japan Suetuna introduced a weekly seminar on the GÃ¶ttingen style where new research results could be discussed. He continued to publish research papers on topics related to\nArtin\n's\n1927\npaper and he also wrote several books: one on algebra and number theory, one on\nanalytic number theory\n, and one on probability. All were based on lecture courses he gave, the probability book being based on a ten lecture course he was invited to give at Hokkaidu University in\n1940\n. The\nAnalytical theory of numbers\nwas originally published in the form of lecture notes but in\n1950\na revised edition was published which incorporated recent developments of the theory. Ikehara, reviewing the book , writes:-\nThis book, based mainly on the\nRiemann\nzeta-functions and L-functions, is a unique exposition of the analytical theory of numbers in a modern sense as can be seen from the chapter headings: I\n)\nRiemann\n's zeta-functions; II\n)\nHecke\n's L-functions; III\n)\nDirichlet\n's L-functions; and IV\n)\nArtin\n's L-series.\nSuetuna was appointed to\nTakagi\n's chair in\n1936\nwhen\nTakagi\nretired; Suetuna had been promoted to full professor in the previous year. The Second World War disrupted life in Japan and in particular it essentially ended Suetuna's research career. After the War he published some articles on the foundations of mathematics and mathematical philosophy which were areas of interest for him. He was particularly interested in Buddhism and this strongly influenced his philosophical thinking. The paper\n[\n2\n]\ndetails his publications consisting of thirty works on number theory, twelve on the foundations of mathematics and eight on Buddhist philosophy. These eight publications make Suetuna an important figure in Buddhist philosophy and probably mean that he is more famous for that topic than he is for mathematics.\nSuetuna was elected to the\nJapan Academy\nin\n1947\n. he retired from his chair in Tokyo University in\n1959\nand was appointed as Director of the Institute of Statistical Mathematics.",
