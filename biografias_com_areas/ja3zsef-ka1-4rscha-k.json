  "biografia": "JÃ³zsef KÃ¼rschÃ¡k\n's mother was Jozefa Teller and his father was AndrÃ¡s KÃ¼rschÃ¡k, a manual worker who died when JÃ³zsef was six years old. After the death of his father, JÃ³zsef was brought up in Budapest by his mother. It is correct to say that JÃ³zsef, although born in Buda, was brought up in Budapest after the death of his father since Budapest was created by the unification of Buda, Obuda and Pest in\n1872\n. KÃ¼rschÃ¡k attended secondary school in the flourishing city that became not only the capital of Hungary but also a major centre for industry, trade, communications, and architecture. Most importantly for the young boy, he was growing up in a city which was a centre for education, and for intellectual and artistic life.\nKÃ¼rschÃ¡k entered the Technical University of Budapest in\n1881\nand graduated in\n1886\nwith qualifications to teach mathematics and physics in secondary schools. He then taught at a school in Roznyo, Slovakia, for two years before returning to the Technical University of Budapest to undertake research. He received his doctorate in\n1890\nand then taught in Budapest, at the Technical University, for the whole of his career. He was appointed in\n1891\nand successively promoted, achieving the rank of professor in\n1900\n.\nIn\n[\n2\n]\nthe authors describe a paper by KÃ¼rschÃ¡k written in\n1898\nin which a regular dodecagon\ninscribed\nin a unit circle is investigated. A trigonometric argument can be used to show that its area of the dodecagon is\n3\nbut KÃ¼rschÃ¡k gives a purely geometric proof. He proves that the dodecagon can be dissected into a set of triangles which can be rearranged so as to fill three squares with sides having length\n1\n. KÃ¼rschÃ¡k's tile, which occurs in the title of\n[\n2\n]\n, is constructed as follows. Start with a square and construct an equilateral triangle drawn inwards on each side. A regular dodecagon has the following\n12\npoints as vertices: the\n8\nintersections of the corresponding sides of adjacent equilateral triangles and the\n4\nmid-points of the sides of the new square formed by the vertices of the four triangles. In fact the first paper which KÃ¼rschÃ¡k wrote was concerned with polygons. This was\nÃber dem Kreise ein-und umgeschriebene Vielecke\nâ\n(\nOn the circles on  rewritten polygons\n)\n(1887)\nwhich investigated extremal properties of polygons inscribed in, and circumscribed about, a circle.\nAnother topic which KÃ¼rschÃ¡k investigated was the differential equations of the calculus of variations. Papers such as\nÃber partielle Differentialgleichungen zweiter Ordnung mit gleichen Charakteristiken\nâ\n(\nOn partial differential equations of second order with the same characteristics\n)\n(1890)\n,\nÃber die partielle Differentialgleichung des Problems\nâ\n(\nOn the partial differential equation of the problem\n)\n(1894)\n,\nÃber die Transformation der partiellen Differentialgleichungen der Variationsrechnung\nâ\n(\nOn the transformation of partial differential equations of the calculus of variations\n)\n(1902)\n, and\nÃber eine charakteristische Eigenschaft der Differentialgleichungen der Variationsrechnung\nâ\n(\nOn a characteristic property of the differential equations of the calculus of variations\n)\n(1905)\nare examples of his work in this area. He proved invariance of the differential equations he was considering under contact transformations. Another problem he solved in this area was to find, in his\n1905\npaper, necessary and sufficient conditions for\n[\n1\n]\n:-\n... a second-order differential expressions to provide the equation belonging to the variation of a multiple integral.\nLed to consider linear algebra in the context of the above work, he wrote a number of papers on matrices and\ndeterminants\nsuch as\nÃber symmetrische Matrices\nâ\n(\nOn symmetric matrices\n)\n(1904)\nand\nEin irreduzibilitÃ¤tssatz in der Theorie der symmetrischen matrizen\nâ\n(\nAn irreducibility theorem in the theory of symmetric matrices\n)\n(1921)\n.\nKÃ¼rschÃ¡k's most important work, however, was in\n1912\nwhen he founded the theory of valuations. His idea was to define\nâ£\nx\nâ£\n| x |\nâ£\nx\nâ£\nfor a rational number\nx\nx\nx\nas follows. Express\nx\nx\nx\nin lowest terms as\np\nn\n(\na\nb\n)\np^{n}(\\Large\\frac{a}{b}\\normalsize )\np\nn\n(\nb\na\nâ\n)\nand then define\nâ£\nx\nâ£\np\n=\np\nâ\nn\n| x |_{p} = p^{-n}\nâ£\nx\nâ£\np\nâ\n=\np\nâ\nn\n. For example\nâ£\n20\n11\nâ£\n2\n=\n1\n4\n| \\large\\frac{20}{11}\\normalsize  |_{2} = \\large\\frac{1}{4}\\normalsize\nâ£\n1\n1\n2\n0\nâ\nâ£\n2\nâ\n=\n4\n1\nâ\n,\nâ£\n20\n11\nâ£\n3\n=\n1\n| \\large\\frac{20}{11}\\normalsize  |_{3} = 1\nâ£\n1\n1\n2\n0\nâ\nâ£\n3\nâ\n=\n1\n,\nâ£\n20\n11\nâ£\n5\n=\n1\n5\n| \\large\\frac{20}{11}\\normalsize  |_{5}= \\large\\frac{1}{5}\\normalsize\nâ£\n1\n1\n2\n0\nâ\nâ£\n5\nâ\n=\n5\n1\nâ\n, and\nâ£\n20\n11\nâ£\n11\n=\n11\n|\\large\\frac{ 20}{11}\\normalsize  |_{11} = 11\nâ£\n1\n1\n2\n0\nâ\nâ£\n1\n1\nâ\n=\n1\n1\n.\nThe rationals are not complete with this metric and their completion is the field of\np\np\np\n-adic numbers. KÃ¼rschÃ¡k's work was inspired by earlier work of\nJulius KÃ¶nig\n,\nSteinitz\nand\nHensel\n. The importance of KÃ¼rschÃ¡k's valuations is that they allow notions of convergence and limits be used in the theory of abstract fields and greatly enrich the topic.\nDÃ©nes KÃ¶nig\nand\nVon Neumann\nwere both students of KÃ¼rschÃ¡k and many other famous mathematicians benefited from his teaching.\nDÃ©nes KÃ¶nig\nreceived his doctorate in\n1907\nfor a thesis written under KÃ¼rschÃ¡k's supervision.\nPeter\nwrites in\n[\n4\n]\nthat:-\n... outstanding mathematicians such as\nHunyadi\n,\nJulius KÃ¶nig\n, KÃ¼rschÃ¡k and Rados have contributed to the high standard of mathematical education at the Technical University\n[\nof Budapest\n]\n. Their scientific and teaching activity affected mathematical life in the whole country and laid the foundation of the internationally recognized mathematical school in Hungary.\nIndeed KÃ¼rschÃ¡k achieved this through his excellent teaching as well as bringing the very best out of his students. He was one of the main organisers of mathematical competitions and to honour his outstanding contributions in this area the\nLorÃ¡nd EÃ¶tvÃ¶s\nMathematics Competition, started in\n1925\n, was renamed the JÃ³zsef KÃ¼rschÃ¡k Mathematics Competition in\n1949\n.\nKÃ¼rschÃ¡k was elected to the Hungarian Academy of Sciences in\n1897\n.",
