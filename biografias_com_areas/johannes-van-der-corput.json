  "biografia": "Johannes van der Corput\n's parents were Gualtherus Johannes van der Corput\n(10\nJanuary\n1847\n, Oostrhout -\n16\nApril\n1916)\nand Anna Maria Blomjous\n(17\nFebruary\n1850\n, Tilburg -\n10\nMarch\n1937\n, Rotterdam\n)\n. Gualtherus, who had a grocery selling colonial products, married Anna on\n19\nApril\n1882\nin Tilburg. They had six children: Hendrika Cornelia Adriana van der Corput\n(\nborn\n1883)\n; Cornelis Adrianus Walterus van der Corput\n(\nborn\n1884)\n; Adriana Henrica Cornelia van der Corput\n(\nborn\n1885)\n; Josephus Walterus van der Corput\n(\nborn\n1887)\n; Johannes Gualtherus van der Corput\n(\nthe subject of this biography\n)\n(\nborn\n1890)\n; and Gualtherus Adrianus Henricus van der Corput\n(\nborn\n1892)\n. Johannes was always known as Jan by his friends and colleagues.\nJan's father, Gualtherus Johannes van der Corput, does not appear to have had any particular mathematical skills but there were other van der Corput's who did have strong mathematical connections. For example Johannes de Corput\n(1542\n-\n1611)\n, also known as Johannes Corputius, was a Dutch engineer, cartographer and military leader. He is best known for his beautiful map of Duisburg completed in\n1566\n. Anna Maria van der Corput\n(1599\n-\n1645)\nmarried Jacob Witt\n(1589\n-\n1674)\nand they had eight children including the two mathematicians and statesmen\nJan de Witt\nand Cornelius de Witt. Jan van der Corput was not the only one of the six children to become a mathematician, for his brother Cornelis Adrianus Walterus van der Corput studied at Delft and became a secondary-school teacher of mathematics.\nJan attended primary school in Rotterdam before studying at the Gymnasium Erasmianum in Rotterdam. This famous Gymnasium, the second oldest in the Netherlands, was founded in\n1328\n. At the time that van der Corput studied there it was situated at the corner of the Coolsingel and the Laurensstraat. He graduated from this school in\n1908\nand, after much deliberation as to what subject he should study, chose mathematics. Jacob Korevaar writes in\n[\n4\n]\n:-\nHis family wanted him to study medicine and he himself considered history\n(\nin which he always maintained a lively interest\n)\nand the Dutch language. In the end the recommendation of his secondary-school teacher, R H van Dorsten, was decisive: Jan should study mathematics, pure mathematics.\nVan der Corput entered the University of Leiden where Jan Cornelis Kluyver\n(1860\n-\n1932)\nwas the professor with research interests in analysis, differential geometry and number theory. Kluyver, who originally undertook research on geometry, had, after his appointment in\n1892\nas Professor of Mathematical Analysis at Leiden, changed his research efforts to analysis, and in a relatively short time brought analysis teaching to a level that had not previously been reached in the Netherlands. We are now accustomed to analysis being presented according to very rigorous rules, but before Kluyver's time, analysis in the Netherlands was still almost at the level of the\n18\nth century. Despite the improvement in the level of analysis teaching that Kluyver was making at Leiden, van der Corput did, later in his life, sometimes make critical comments about the level of Kluyver's courses and research. Despite this, he must have found Kluyver's number theory interesting since, after graduating in\n1914\n, he decided to undertake research at Leiden for a Ph.D. advised by Kluyver.\nBefore van der Corput had started his research, on\n28\nJuly\n1914\n, the Austro-Hungarian Empire declared war on Serbia. Two days later, the Dutch declared themselves neutral and, as further nations joined the war in August\n1914\n, the Dutch repeated their declaration of neutrality on each occasion. Despite this position of neutrality, nevertheless they mobilised the Royal Netherlands Army throughout the war years\n1914\n-\n18\n. Van der Corput was called up for military service and served as a captain. He became interested in horseback riding during these years of service. His position in the middle of his education allowed him to leave the Army before the standard demobilisation at the end of the war, and he taught mathematics in secondary schools in Leeuwarden from\n1917\nto\n1919\nwhile, at the same time, he undertook research for his Ph.D. advised by Kluyver.\nIn\n1919\nhe submitted his thesis\nOver roosterpunten in het platte vlak. De beteekenis van de methoden van Voronoi en Pfeiffer\nâ\n(\nOn grid points in the flat plane. The meaning of Voronoi and Pfeiffer's methods\n)\n(1919)\n. This thesis, on lattice points in the plane, studied problems which had interested number theorists for quite a while.\nGauss\nhad posed the problem, known as the \"circle problem\", to determine the number of integer lattice points that are in a circle with centre at the origin and radius\nâ\nr\nâr\nâ\nr\n. Since the equation of the circle is\nx\n2\n+\ny\n2\n=\nr\nx^{2} + y^{2} = r\nx\n2\n+\ny\n2\n=\nr\n, the problem is to find how many pairs of integersÂ\nm\nm\nm\nÂ andÂ\nn\nn\nn\nÂ there are such that\nm\n2\n+\nn\n2\nâ¤\nr\nm^{2} + n^{2} â¤ r\nm\n2\n+\nn\n2\nâ¤\nr\n.\nSince, on average, each unit square contains one lattice point, the number of lattice points in the circle will be\nÏ\nr\n+\nR\n\\pi r + R\nÏ\nr\n+\nR\nwhere,\nR\nR\nR\nis the remainder term.\nGauss\nhad shown that\nR\nR\nR\nis at most of order\nâ\nr\nâr\nâ\nr\nand\nSierpinski\nhad improved the remainder term to be of order\nr\n1\n/\n3\nr^{1/3}\nr\n1\n/\n3\n.\nEdmund Landau\nin GÃ¶ttingen, and\nG H Hardy\nand\nJ E Littlewood\nin Cambridge, England, had all been interested in this problem and written papers which gave a lower bound of\nr\n1\n/\n4\nr^{1/4}\nr\n1\n/\n4\nfor the remainder. These papers led van der Corput to try to improve the remainder term and also to look at the number of lattice points inside other figures in the plane, in particular in the region between an orthogonal hyperbola and its asymptote\n(\nknown as the\nDirichlet\nproblem\n)\n.\nWhile working on his thesis, van der Corput had made contact with\nEdmund Landau\nwho was greatly impressed with his work. After graduating he taught mathematics at a secondary school in Utrecht for the year\n1919\n-\n20\nand then spent the summer of\n1920\nworking with\nEdmund Landau\nin GÃ¶ttingen. The result of this summer research visit was the joint paper\nE Landau\nand J G van der Corput,\nÃber Gitterpunkte in ebenen Bereichen\nâ\n(\nOn grid points in the plane\n)\n(1920)\nand two single authored papers by van der Corput, namely\nÃber Gitterpunkte in der Ebene\nâ\n(\nOn grid points in the plane\n)\n(1920)\nand\nZahlentheoretische AbschÃ¤tzungen\nâ\n(\nNumber theoretical estimates\n)\n(1921)\n.\nIn\n1920\nvan der Corput was appointed as an assistant to\nArnaud Denjoy\nat the University of Utrecht.\nDenjoy\nwas a French mathematician, who had studied and worked in France until\n1917\nwhen he was appointed to a professorship at the University of Utrecht. He would only remain in Utrecht until\n1922\nwhen he returned to a professorship at the University of Paris. Van der Corput was his assistant for the final two years of\nDenjoy\n's stay in Utrecht then, in\n1922\n, van der Corput was appointed as professor at the University of Fribourg in Switzerland.\nLet us return to the\n1921\npaper mentioned above. In it he introduced the method of exponential sums which was a new method for making number-theoretic estimates. It led to a breakthrough when he was able to improve the remainder term in the circle problem from\nr\n1\n/\n3\nr^{1/3}\nr\n1\n/\n3\nto\nr\n33\n/\n100\nr^{33/100}\nr\n3\n3\n/\n1\n0\n0\n. This might not seem a large improvement but it was highly significant in that many who had worked on the topic were coming to believe that\nr\n1\n/\n3\nr^{1/3}\nr\n1\n/\n3\nwas the correct answer.\nVan der Corput only spent one year at the University of Fribourg before accepting a professorship at the University of Groningen in\n1923\n. For some years he continued to undertake research on number theory problems associated with his earlier work on lattice points in the plane, continuing to develop and refine his method of exponential sums. In the\n1930\ns his research interests broadened, partly because of the courses that he was giving at the University of Groningen but mainly, it seems, because he had to find topics for around fifteen Ph.D. students. He undertook research on the asymptotic evaluation of general types of integrals publishing\nZur Methode der stationÃ¤ren Phase. I: Einfache Integrale\nâ\n(\nOn the stationary phase method. I: Simple integrals\n)\n(1934)\nand\nZur Methode der stationÃ¤ren Phase. II: Wiederum einfache Integrale\nâ\n(\nOn the stationary phase method. II: More simple integrals\n)\n(1936)\n.\nVan der Corput attended the International Congress of Mathematicians in  Strasbourg in September\n1920\n, the International Congress of Mathematicians in  Zurich in September\n1932\n, and was a plenary lecturer at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Oslo in July\n1936\ndelivering the lecture\nDiophantische Approximationen\nâ\n(\nDiophantine approximations\n)\non\n17\nJuly.\nYou can read his introduction to his plenary lecture at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nIn Germany the Nazis came to power in\n1933\nand over the following years it was clear to almost everyone that they were preparing for war. Van der Corput was strongly opposed to the Nazis and, in a letter to\nBartel van der Waerden\nin\n1945\nexplained his attitude towards Germany\n[\n5\n]\n:-\nConcerning me personally, in January\n1939\nI turned down\nErich Hecke\n's invitation, passed on to me by\nHarald Bohr\n, to give one or more lectures, because I refused to come to Germany as long as Hitler was in power. Consequently I have not been in Germany after\n1932\n.\nHe had also resigned from\nZentralblatt fÃ¼r Mathematik\nin\n1938\nafter\nTullio Levi-Civita\n, as a Jew, was dismissed from the board following the passing of the September\n1938\nRacial Laws. Van der Corput wrote in a\n1945\nletter\n[\n5\n]\n:-\nSpeaking of Jews, when\nLevi-Civita\nwas thrown out of 'Zentralblatt fÃ¼r Mathematik', I withdrew as an associate\n(\nwhile giving my reasons\n)\nand suggested all Dutch associates to do the same and to become associates for the 'Mathematical Reviews'.\nIt appears that the rise of the Nazis and then their occupation of the Netherlands, led to a change in van der Corput lifestyle\n[\n3\n]\n:-\nIn the late thirties and the years\n1940\n-\n45\nof the German occupation of the Netherlands there was a big change in van der Corput's orientation. Exaggerating a little, one might say that before the war he had lived only for mathematics, whereas in this period he became much more socially engaged. Still a bachelor, he met a remarkable woman, Jeannette Cornelia Houwink\n(1898\n-\n1989)\n. She had obtained a law doctorate at Groningen and married fellow-student H W O ten Cate in\n1920\n, worked at the tax department for a while, had three children and became a writer. After her divorce, van der Corput married her on\n31\nAugust\n1942\n, the birthday of the Dutch queen in exile. She would strongly support him in his activities\n(\nand share his frugality when it concerned themselves\n)\n. He played an active role in the university opposition to the German occupants, for which he regularly travelled to Amsterdam. In their home, he and his wife provided shelter for persons hiding from the enemy. They also assisted Jewish mathematicians from abroad. At the beginning of\n1945\nvan der Corput and two persons hiding at his house were arrested, but thanks to the help of some unknown person, he was released after three anxious weeks.\nIn a letter to\nBartel van der Waerden\nin July\n1945\n, van der Corput gives more details\n[\n5\n]\n:-\nPeople were in hiding in my house throughout the entire war,\n23\nin total, of which\n5\nwere Jews; I was a representative at Groningen of the Professors Resistance Group. When I was arrested in February\n1945\n, they found two people in hiding in my house, of which one was Jewish. I was suffering from angina and was released from prison after a week. My house and all my furniture were impounded\n[\nby the authorities\n]\nbut we moved back on the day of liberation . . . I was on the Board of Vrij-Nederland\n[\nFree Netherlands\n]\nand was arrested for disseminating illegal literature.\nDuring the war a number of the professors at Groningen had formed a small group to discuss how universities, in a post-war situation, could be independent of authoritarian threats. Van der Corput was a member of this group as was Gerardus J van der Leeuw, a professor of history and religion at Groningen. After the war ended in\n1945\n, van der Leeuw was appointed as Minister of Education for The Netherlands. He appointed van der Corput to be the chair of the Committee for the Coordination and Reorganization of Higher Education in Mathematics in The Netherlands. Other members of the committee were\nDavid van Dantzig\n,\nJan A Schouten\n,\nJurjen Koksma\n(\nwho had been a doctoral student of van der Corput\n)\n,\nHendrik Kramers\nand the astrophysicist Marcel G J Minnaert\n(1893\n-\n1970)\n. The Committee became known as \"The Van der Corput Committee.\" In a letter to\nBartel van der Waerden\non\n29\nJuly\n1945\n, van der Corput writes\n[\n5\n]\n:-\nI have been appointed chairman of a commission to reorganise higher education in mathematics in the Netherlands, which will have as its primary duty to offer advice for the filling of vacancies in mathematics.\nThe Committee discussed setting up a Mathematical Centre for Research and Development at either Utrecht or Amsterdam. This idea was strongly pushed by van der Corput and, when the City of Amsterdam showed that it was very positive in its support, they decided on that city. On\n24\nOctober\n1945\nvan der Corput writes in a letter\n[\n5\n]\n:-\nThis week I received an invitation from the Faculty of Natural Sciences at Amsterdam to become WeitzenbÃ¶ck's replacement. ... I do not know what I am going to do. Personally, I like Utrecht better, but maybe I can do more for mathematics in Amsterdam ...\nWe note that Roland WeitzenbÃ¶ck\n(1885\n-\n1955)\nwas a differential geometer who was the professor of mathematics at the University of Amsterdam from\n1923\nuntil he retired in\n1945\n.\nThe Mathematical Centre opened on\n11\nFebruary\n1946\nand van der Corput became its first director. Taking up his professorship at the University of Amsterdam, van der Corput delivered his inaugural lecture\nHet Mathematisch Centrum\nâ\n(\nThe Mathematical Centre\n)\n. In this he said:-\nThe only explanation of why someone chooses to study mathematics is that he gets caught by this science. No one should become a mathematician in search of personal success, but only to contribute to the expansion of a science which is of great importance to mankind. In doing the latter he will become a happy man, because he will enjoy what he does. But he will do this not only for joy, but also for a sense of duty, for society sustaining him has a right to demand that he spends his talents to its interest. Hardy may say that it is not that bad if a few university dons spend their lives on unimportant things, but I think it is bad for society.\nThe Mathematical Centre set up a computing department, a department of mathematical physics, a statistics department and a pure mathematics department\n[\n5\n]\n:-\nVan der Corput considered it as part of the Centre's mission to provide advanced mathematics courses and lectures for persons around the country who had been unable to obtain a university education. Many Dutch mathematicians participated in this program sponsored by the Centre, which also included summer courses for secondary-school teachers of mathematics. The Centre furthermore provided positions for promising young Dutch mathematicians who were likely to obtain a university appointment after a few years. Lively contacts developed with mathematicians from abroad.\nPaul ErdÅs\nlectured here in\n1948\non his \"elementary\" proof of the prime number theorem\n(\nwhich he had found jointly with\nA Selberg\n)\n; Van der Corput prepared an early Centre publication of the famous proof.\nVan der Corput delivered the\nRouse Ball\nLecture at the University of Cambridge in\n1948\n. He was a Visiting Professor at Stanford University from\n1950\nto\n1952\n, and after returning to Amsterdam he became somewhat disappointed that the atmosphere there was not as conducive to research as it had been in the United States. This led him to leave Amsterdam in\n1954\nand accept a permanent position at the University of California at Berkeley. He was on the faculty at Berkeley until\n1958\nbut continued to have Berkeley as his main residence until\n1966\n. He had various visiting positions in the years\n1958\n-\n66\n, at Mathematics Research Center in Madison, Wisconsin, and in Rome. In\n1966\nvan der Corput returned to Europe where he lived part of the time in Amsterdam and part in Antwerp.\nAmong the many honours which van der Corput received we mention his election to the\nNetherlands Academy of Sciences\n(1929)\nand to the\nRoyal Belgium Academy of Science\n(1932)\n. He was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Bordeaux\n(1952)\nand by the Technical University at Delft\n(1966)\n. Let us also note that van der Corput was an editor of\nActa Arithmetica\nfrom the time the journal was founded in\n1936\n.",
