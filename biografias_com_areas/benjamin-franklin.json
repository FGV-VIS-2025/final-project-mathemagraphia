  "biografia": "Benjamin Franklin\nwas born in Boston, but spent most of his life in Philadelphia\n(\npunctuated by residences in London and Passy, France\n)\n. His formal education lasted less than two years, and so he was mainly self-educated, aided by the convenient access to books provided by an apprenticeship in the printing business.\nFranklin is best known in the popular imagination for his nonscientific pursuits: printer, American revolutionary, ambassador, to mention only a few roles he played. His scientific reputation rests mainly on his accomplishments as an inventor and as a pioneering theorist in the physics of electricity, but his interests were also mathematical. His version of magic square - a variant now termed the Franklin magic square - was inspired by the work of\nStifel\nand\nFrÃ©nicle\n, both of whose magic squares were of a more traditional variety. He also drew magic circles.\nHis first published magic square and his only published magic circle appeared in a\n1767\nbook which also included unrelated excerpts from work by\nThomas Simpson\n. Two years later, Franklin published this square:\nÂ Â\n52\n61\n4\n13\n20\n29\n36\n45\nÂ Â\n14\n3\n62\n51\n46\n35\n30\n19\nÂ Â\n53\n60\n5\n12\n21\n28\n37\n44\nÂ Â\n11\n6\n59\n54\n43\n38\n27\n22\nÂ Â\n55\n58\n7\n10\n23\n26\n39\n42\nÂ Â\n9\n8\n57\n56\n41\n40\n25\n24\nÂ Â\n50\n63\n2\n15\n18\n31\n34\n47\nÂ Â\n16\n1\n64\n49\n48\n33\n32\n17\nAside from the row and column sums being constant, this square also has many other \"magical\" properties. Further examples of Franklin's magic squares would not be published until two centuries after his death, and doubtless many more were lost. Those which do survive are quite impressive.\nFranklin enjoyed close personal and professional relationships with quite a few of the important thinkers of his day, such as Hume, Priestley, Lavoisier and\nCondorcet\n. He was a member of the learned societies of many nations. Among these were the\nRoyal Society\n, which awarded him its prestigious Copley medal for his work in electricity, and the American Philosophical Society, of which he was a founder. He received several honorary degrees, including a doctorate from St. Andrews.",
