  "biografia": "Frances Evelyn Cave-Browne-Cave,\nknown as Evelyn,\nwas the daughter of Sir Thomas Cave-Browne-Cave\n(1835\n-\n1924)\nand Blanche Matilda Mary Anne Milton\n(1851\n-\n1928)\n. Thomas Cave-Browne-Cave was a civil servant who became Deputy Accountant-General of the Army from\n1897\nto\n1900\nand a Commissioner of the Royal Hospital Chelsea from\n1899\nto\n1923\n.Â He was appointed Companion, Order of the Bath in\n1907\nand was appointed Knight in\n1911\n. He married Blanche Matilda Mary Anne Milton in Immanuel Church, Streatham Common, on\n30\nApril\n1870\n. Blanche Milton was the daughter of Sir John Milton and Blanche Matilda Elinor Feild. Thomas and Blanche Cave-Browne-Cave had six children only five of whom reached adulthood: Blanche IsabelÂ Cave-Browne-CaveÂ\n(12\nJuly\n1871\n-\n10\nAugust\n1871)\n; Jeanette GertrudeÂ Cave-Browne-CaveÂ\n(16\nSeptember\n1872\n-\n9\nMarch\n1950)\n;\nBeatrice MabelÂ Cave-Browne-Cave\nÂ\n(30\nMay\n1874\n-\n9\nJuly\n1947)\n; Frances EvelynÂ Cave-Browne-CaveÂ\n(21\nFebruary\n1876\n-\n30\nMarch\n1965)\n, the subject of this biography; Thomas ReginaldÂ Cave-Browne-Cave\n(11\nJanuary\n1885\n-\n26\nNovember\n1969)\n; and Henry MeyrickÂ Cave-Browne-Cave\n(1\nFebruary\n1887\n-\n5\nAugust\n1965)\n.\nPerhaps we should explain how the family came to have, what must appear, a slightly unusual surname. It was not unusual when upper-class families intermarried to keep the surname of both sides of the family by adopting a hyphenated name containing both family names. The name Cave dates back to William the Conqueror who, in\n1069\n, conferred on two Yorkshire brothers the Lordships of North and South Cave. King Charles I had created the baronetcy in June\n1641\nfor Thomas Cave, who had supported the King in the English Civil War, and this hereditary honour, having the holder addressed as \"Sir\", had continued to be inherited. \"Cave\" had become \"Cave-Browne\" in\n1752\nand the additional \"Cave\" had been added in\n1839\n. Frances Evelyn Cave-Browne-Cave appears on her mathematical publications as \"F E Cave-Browne-Cave\" but in her less formal works she gives her name as \"F E Cave.\" We will refer to Frances EvelynÂ Cave-Browne-Cave as \"Evelyn\" and her sister\nBeatrice Mabel Cave-Browne-Cave\nas \"Beatrice\" throughout this biography to avoid confusion.\nEvelyn was brought up in quite privileged circumstances. At the time of the\n1881\ncensus she was five years old living at Burnage, North Side, Streatham Common with her parents, her maternal grandmother, her two sisters and three servants\n(\na domestic parlour maid, a nursemaid and a cook\n)\n. The three sisters were all educated at home and by the time of the\n1891\ncensus Evelyn was living with her parents, two sisters, two brothers, and four servants\n(\ncook, nurse, parlour maid, and housemaid\n)\n. She was fortunate to grow up in a family where at least two of her siblings, her sister Beatrice and brother Thomas Reginald, shared her enthusiasm for mathematics. In\n1895\nshe sat the entrance examination for Girton College, Cambridge and was admitted. Her sister Beatrice sat the Girton College entrance examinations at the same time and was also admitted. Neither of Evelyn's brothers studied at university but both became engineers, first in the navy and then the Royal Air Force on its formation in\n1918\n. We give a few more details of their careers below.\nAt Cambridge, Evelyn was in the same year as\nG H Hardy\nand\nJames Hopwood Jeans\n. One of her lecturers was\nWilliam Young\n.\nMary Cartwright\nrecalled\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nFrances Cave told me that once, while she was being taught by\nWilliam Young\n, he kept tilting his chair until it slipped and he went under the table. With great difficulty she and the others refrained from laughing. He then got up and all he said was, \"Take out a fresh sheet of paper.\"\nIn\n1898\nEvelyn sat Part I of the Mathematical Tripos examinations and was a Wrangler. That is not quite correct since at this time women were not ranked in the list of Wranglers but simply told their position between two men. Evelyn was ranked between the Fourth and Fifth Wranglers, so above her were Ronald William Henry Turnbull Hudson\n(1876\n-\n1904)\n, the Senior Wrangler, John Forbes Cameron\n(1873\n-\n1952)\n,Â\nJames Hopwood Jeans\nand\nG H Hardy\n. In the following year she graduated after taking Part II of the Mathematical Tripos examinations, again being First Class. After this outstanding performance, Evelyn was offered a three-year research studentship by Girton College. This, in fact, was the first research grant that Girton had awarded and it had come about through the efforts of Florence Margaret Durham\n(1869\n-\n1949)\n. Florence Durham had been a student at Girton College, taking the Natural Sciences Tripos Part\n1\nin\n1891\nand Part\n2\nin\n1892\n. She had written to the\nGirton Review\nsaying that the women's colleges should:-\n... encourage advanced and research work and thus to show the world that women mean to do serious work and have higher aims in view than mere success in examination.\nThis led to the setting up of the research studentship which was awarded\nto Evelyn in\n1899\n.\nEvelyn undertook research at Girton College, advised by\nKarl Pearson\n. In\n1902\nshe published\nOn the Correlation between the Barometric Height at Stations on the Eastern Side of the Atlantic\nin the\nProceedings\nof the\nRoyal Society\n. The author is given as F E Cave-Browne-Cave with some assistance from\nKarl Pearson\n. The paper has the following introduction:-\nIn a memoir on the correlation and variation of the barometric height at divers stations in the British Isles by Professor\nKarl Pearson\nand Dr\nAlice Lee\n, it is suggested\n(\ni\n)\nthat interesting results might be obtained by correlating the barometer at stations on the east and west sides of the Atlantic, allowing an interval of time between the observations, and\n(\nii\n)\nthat with a certain distance between stations, the correlation would be found to be negative,Â i.e., a high barometer at the one station corresponding to a low barometer at the second. In order to deal with these points, steps were taken in\n1897\nto collect the necessary material. Twenty years,\n1879\n-\n1898\ninclusive, were selected for consideration, and the early morning barometric observations for these years, copied from material provided by the kindness of the British Meteorological Office for the following East Atlantic stations:- BÃ¸dÃ¸, FlorÃ¸, Skudesnaes, Valencia, Lisbon, and Funchal. These give a very fair chain of stations from the north of Norway to Madeira. On the west side of the Atlantic we obtained data for the same years for Halifax and Toronto by aid of the Director of the Canadian Meteorological Service.\nIn\n1903\nEvelyn, who in that year was appointed as a lecturer in Girton College, and her sister\nBeatrice\n, who was teaching mathematics at Streatham and Clapham High School\n[\n3\n]\n:-\n... were among six collaborators who worked on a large scale study of child development, overseen by Pearson, that analysed data collected from over\n4000\nchildren, including some of\nBeatrice\n's high school students. Their part-time work for the biometrics Lab was uncompensated until a grant established in\n1904\nby the Worshipful Company of Drapers allowed\nPearson\nto provide his assistants with small stipends.\nWe learn a little more about this study from\n[\n8\n]\n:-\nThe project collected physical measurements and character assessments from\n4000\nchildren and their parents in order to establish evidence of the inheritance of what\nPearson\ncalled \"moral qualities,\" attributes that we would now identify as aspects of intelligence or personality. Both sisters Cave-Browne-Cave were among the six collaborators who worked on the project. ...\n[\nPearson\n's\n]\ncollaborators gathered the data by measuring and observing the children. ... Only a few assistants, including Frances and\nBeatrice Cave-Browne-Cave\n, processed the data, creating tables, and computing correlations.\nIn\n1905\nEvelyn published a follow-up paper to the one she had published in\n1902\n. The paper was titled\nOn the Influence of the Time Factor on the Correlation between the Barometric Heights at Stations more than\n1000\nMiles apart\nand had the single author F E Cave-Browne-Cave. Like the earlier paper, it was published in the\nProceedings\nof the\nRoyal Society\n. The paper begins:-\nAn investigation of the relationship of the daily barometric heights on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean has been in progress for some years, and in a preliminary note by Professor\nPearson\nand myself some account was given of the contemporaneous relationship of a chain of stations from the extreme north of Norway down the west coasts of Europe and Africa. Observations for this east side of the Atlantic have now been copied for twenty years, as far as stations are available from Norway to the Cape, and the only need here is more aid in the very laborious reductions necessary before any inferences can be drawn. A similar chain of stations from Nova Scotia to the Falkland Isles has been completed, with the exception of Brazil, from which, so far, we have been able to obtain no data whatever.\nThis paper was the last of Evelyn's research publications and from that time on she concentrated on teaching and administration. In\n1907\nshe was awarded an external M.A. degree by Trinity College, Dublin.\nIn\n1918\nshe was appointed as director of studies at Girton College and carried out the duties of that role in addition to her lecturing. We learn something of her attitude to mathematics and to teaching from a letter she wrote to\nNature\nin\n1922\n[\n5\n]\n:-\nIn a notice\n[\npublished in 'Nature'\n]\nof an address by Dr Hoffman, the words are used: \"Imagination is what the mathematician is ever trying to get rid of.\" As such misconceptions as this are unfortunately rather widespread, it may be useful to protest against them. Imagination is essential to mathematics. The work of the great mathematicians affords many striking examples of creative imagination, and for the proper understanding and appreciation of even the elementary parts of the subject the use of imagination is necessary. One of the most important qualities of a good mathematical teacher is the power of stimulating the pupils' imagination, and it is, perhaps, the neglect of this faculty by some teachers which is responsible for the dullness and lifelessness of what is too often taught in schools under the name of mathematics.\nDavis comments on Evelyn as a teacher in\n[\n6\n]\n:-\nDuring discussions concerning his academic appointment in\n1930\n, Thomas\n[\nEvelyn's brother\n]\nconfirmed that his sister believed the primary function of a university was to teach, and that trouble taken with weaker students was more rewarding because one could make a proportionately greater improvement. Evelyn was a gifted teacher who was especially talented in helping less able students: a stammer that affected her normal speech completely disappeared when she was teaching.\nWe learn a little more of her character by looking at\n[\n4\n]\nbut first we set the scene. William Hurrell Mallock\n(1849\n-\n1923)\npublished the novel\nThe New Republic\nin\n1877\n. It was a satirical work making fun of several of the leading people at Oxford University. One of the famous people featuring in the novel was\nWilliam Kingdon Clifford\nwho was depicted as Mr Saunders.\nAlan Broadbent\n, editor of\nThe Mathematical Gazette\nhad suggested in an editorial that Mr Saunders's attitude described in the novel was a distortion and not a falsification of\nClifford\n's attitude. Evelyn writes in\n[\n4\n]\n:-\nSIR, - I protest most strongly against your suggestion that Mallock's \"portrait\" in 'The New Republic' is only a distortion and not a falsification of\nClifford\n's attitude. Anyone who compares the 'Lectures and Essays' with 'The New Republic' can easily see the fundamental difference between\nClifford\nand Mr Saunders. Yours, etc., F E Cave.\nWe also learn of Evelyn's character from\n[\n6\n]\n:-\nCavey, as she was sometimes affectionately known, was an archetypal Girtonian of austere and old-fashioned tastes. She was fond of gardening and a former student particularly remembered the zest with which she chopped wood for her sitting-room fire. She was mainly responsible for drafting the original college statutes in\n1924\n. She retired in\n1936\nto live with her siblings in Southampton, and died in Shedfield Lodge Nursing Home ...\nThe official notice of her death states:-\nFrances Evelyn Cave-Browne-Cave of Bassett Mount, Beechmount Road, Bassett, Southampton died\n30\nMarch\n1965\nat Shedfield Lodge Nursing Home, Sedfield, Hampshire.\nShe was buried in St Peter's Churchyard, Wellesbourne, Stratford-on-Avon District, Warwickshire. Her father, four of her siblings\n(\nBeatrice and her two brothers\n)\n, and many others named Cave-Browne-Cave are buried in St Peter's Churchyard.\nWe promised further details of Evelyn's brothers. Thomas Reginald Cave-Browne-Cave attended Dulwich College and became an Engineering Officer in the Royal Navy. He transferred in\n1913\nto Naval Wing of the Royal Navy Air Service and then to the R.A.F. on its formation. He devoted himself to the design, construction and operation of aircraft. He presented a paper at the British Association meeting on airships in\n1919\n. In\n1931\nhe was appointed Professor of Engineering at Southampton University. In\n1954\nhe won the Bicentenary Competition, 'Life in the year\n2000\n', of the Royal Society of Arts, with his essay 'A scheme for roof-top roadways'. He read his winning essay to the Society on\n24\nNovember\n1954\n.\nHenry Meyrick Cave-Browne-Cave initially followed a similar career to his brother, being trained at Dulwich College, and becoming an Engineering Officer in the Royal Navy. In World War I, he served in the Royal Navy Air Service and then joined the R.A.F. on its formation as a lieutenant colonel. He became Commanding Officer of the Far East Flight but a flying accident on January\n1939\ncaused him serious injuries and ended his active career.",
