  "biografia": "Johannes Haantjes\nwas the second son of Hantje Johans Haantjes\n(1880\n-\n1939)\nand Reinskje Spijksma\n(1883\n-\n1943)\n. Hantje and Reinskje  married in\n1907\n. Johannes had one older brother Johan Haantjes\n(1908\n-\n1978)\nwho studied physics and became director of the Philips Physics Laboratory in Eindhoven, and one younger brother Jetze Haantjes\n(1914\n-\n1975)\n. He also had four younger sisters Pietje Haantjes\n(1911\n-\n2002)\n, Janneke Haantjes\n(1913\n-\n1994)\n, Hinke Haantjes\n(1916\n-\n1992)\n, and Grietje Haantjes\n(1922\n-\n2014)\n. Hantje Haantjes was a teacher and, at the time his son Johannes was born, he was the headmaster of the school in the village of Itens. Reinskje had also been a teacher before she married. Johannes attended his father's school in Itens for his primary education, then moved to the Hogere Burgerschool in Leeuwarden for his secondary education. Itens is only a small village and it had no secondary school. Leeuwarden, about\n14\nkm northeast of Itens, is the closest large town. When Johannes was in the middle of his secondary education, his father was appointed as headmaster of the school in Valkenburg\n(\nSouth Holland\n)\nso he completed his schooling in Leiden, a major city a few kilometres to the east of Valkenburg\n(\nwhich is now part of Katwijk\n)\n.\nAfter graduating from the High School in Leiden in\n1927\n, Haantjes entered the University of Leiden where his chosen major subjects were mathematic and physics. His lecturers included Jan Cornelis Kluyver\n(1860\n-\n1932)\nand Willem van der Woude\n(1876\n-\n1974)\n. Van der Woude had studied for his doctorate at Groningen advised by\nPieter Hendrik Schoute\nand, from\n1916\n, was professor of mathematics and mechanics at the University of Leiden. Haantjes was also taught by\nJan Arnoldus Schouten\nwho was the professor of mathematics at Delft University but taught a course on differential geometry at Leiden as a guest lecturer. Another of Haantjes' lecturers was Johannes Droste\n(1886\n-\n1963)\n. Droste had received a Ph.D. in\n1916\nfor his thesis\nThe gravitational field of one or more bodies according to the theory of Einstein\n(\nDutch\n)\nwhich he worked on at Leiden advised by\nH A Lorentz\n. After teaching at the\nGymnasium\nin Gorkum, he was appointed as\nPaul Ehrenfest\n's assistant at Leiden before being promoted to professor in\n1930\n.\nHaantjes continued his studies at the University of Leiden, undertaking research for his doctorate advised by van der Woude. Although\nJan Schouten\nwas not on the faculty of the University of Leiden, he did advise Haantjes in an unofficial capacity. On\n19\nMay\n1933\nHaantjes was awarded a Ph.D. for his\n102\n-page thesis\nHet beweeglijk assenstelsel in de affiene ruimte\nâ\n(\nThe moving coordinate system in the affine space\n)\n. In\n[\n1\n]\nvan der Woude gives the background to the thesis:-\nLet me first remind you that at the beginning of this century\n[\n20\nth century\n]\n, certainly also in the Netherlands, there was interest in multi-dimensional and non-Euclidean geometry. Yet differential magnetism was still predominantly three-dimensional. It had found a certain conclusion through rather extensive textbooks such as the \"Lezioni\" by\nLuigi Bianchi\n, but especially through the encyclopaedic four-part \"ThÃ©orie des Surfaces\" by\nGaston Darboux\n. But then comes an almost stormy interest in many more general forms of differential magnetism. Why the sudden reversal? Undoubtedly under the influence of the then physical theories. Think, for example,\nEinstein\n; he needs a space that is neither three-dimensional nor Euclidean. Thus suddenly multi-dimensional, flat or curved, affine, projective, conformal geometries arise.\nA few months after Haantjes' thesis was accepted, his first paper, a joint publication with his thesis advisor van der Woude appeared. This paper\nÃber das bewegende Achsensystem im affinen Raum: Ableitung der Grundformeln der FlÃ¤chentheorie\nâ\n(\nOn the moving axis system in an affine space: Deviation from the basic formula of flat theory\n)\nwas written in German and was published in the\nProceeding\nof the\nKoninklijke Nederlandse Akademie van Wetenschappen\n. The authors begin their introduction as follows:-\nIt is well known that the use of a moving axis system for the handling of many questions from differential geometry makes a considerable simplification. In the present work an axis system is considered whose movement depends on two parameters. By allowing the origin of this system to describe an area in three-dimensional\n(\naffine\n)\nspace, the basic formulas\n(\nrelations between the two fundamental-value tensors\n)\nare derived simultaneously with the formulas, which are of great importance for the applications ...\nBy the time this paper was published, Haantjes was already working as an assistant to\nJan Schouten\nat Delft University. Willem van der Woude writes\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nIt did not take him much time to familiarize himself with the new calculation method and to immerse himself completely in the geometric world of thought of his boss. He was precise, critical and - a characteristic that repeatedly emerges - very keen on completing an investigation once it had begun.\nSchouten\nand Haantjes published two joint papers in\n1934\n, namely\nGenerelle Feldtheorie. VIII. AutogeodÃ¤tische Linien und Weltlinien\nâ\n(\nGeneral Field Theory. VIII. Autogeodetic lines and world lines\n)\nand\nÃber die konforminvariante Gestalt der Maxwellschen Gleichungen und der elektromagnetischen Impuls-Energiegleichungen.\n(\nKonforme Feldtheorie I\n)\nâ\n(\nOn the conformally invariant design of the Maxwells equations and the electromagnetic impulse-energy equations.\n(\nConformal Field Theory I\n)\n)\n. After a year at Delft, in\n1934\n, he was appointed as a docent at the University of Leiden but also continued to hold the assistantship at Delft until\n1938\n. At Leiden he taught geometry and mechanics to students of mathematics and theoretical physics. He interrupted his work in Delft and Leiden with a short stay at the University of Edinburgh, Scotland, where he gave differential geometry lectures.\nIn\n1936\nHaantjes and\nJan Schouten\nwere co-authors of the article\nOn the theory of the geometric object\nwhich was published in the\nProceedings\nof the\nEdinburgh Mathematical Society\n. The authors begin the article by reviewing the history of the idea of a \"geometric object.\"\nWe give a version of the start of the Introduction at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nIn\n1938\nhe became professor of mathematics, mechanics and the theory of relativity at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam\n(\nFree University of Amsterdam\n)\n.\nOn\n4\nApril\n1939\nHaantjes married Marie Antoinette Mulder in Leiden. Marie was the daughter of Jean Pierre Mulder\n(1879\n-\n1959)\n, a book printer, and Anna Marie van der Most van Spijk\n(1880\n-\n1960)\n. At the time of the marriage, Haantjes was\n29\nyears old and his wife Marie was\n24\n. They had four children, the eldest being Hanneke Haantjes\n(1940\n-\n2007)\n. Marie Antoinette Haantjes died in\n2001\n.\nFollowing World War II, in\n1945\nhe was made a full professor of mathematics and mechanics at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. He delivered his inaugural lecture\nDe zekerheid der meetkunde\nâ\n(\nThe certainty of geometry\n)\non\n4\nOctober\n1945\n(\nit was published in\n1946)\n. For a version of this speech, see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nHe remained in Amsterdam until\n1948\nwhen he was appointed as full professor of geometry at the University of Leiden. This position had become vacant since his former Ph.D. supervisor van der Woude had retired. Haantjes gave his inaugural lecture\nOver enige grondbegrippen uit de meetkunde\nâ\n(\nOn some basic concepts of geometry\n)\nin Leiden on\n28\nMay\n1948\n.\nHaantjes published over\n50\npapers in his short career and we will now look at the titles and give a short extract from a review, of a few of these. We give English versions of the titles of the Dutch papers.\nConformal differential geometry. Curves in conformal euclidean spaces\n(1941)\n: The object of this paper is to obtain intrinsic equations for a curve in EuclideanÂ n-space which determine it up to conformal point transformations. The method is that of proportional Euclidean metrics rather than polyspherical coordinates and therefore ordinary tensor analysis is used.\n(\nwith C Smits\n)\nThe differential geometry of MÃ¶bius in the plane\n(1943)\n: In this paper the differential geometry of plane curves is developed with respect to the group of conformal transformations, which transform circles into circles\n(\nthe so-called\nMÃ¶bius\n-group\n)\n, by studying the group of linear fractional transformations in a complex variableÂ\nz\n=\nx\n+\ni\ny\nz = x + iy\nz\n=\nx\n+\ni\ny\n.\nConformal differential geometry. V. Special surfaces\n(1943)\n: This paper uses the methods developed by the author in four previous papers. Some special surfaces in three-space are studied. Among the results are the following three theorems.\n(1)\nIf a system of lines of curvature of a surface consists of\nDarboux\ncurves, then it consists of circles.\n(2)\nA necessary and sufficient condition that a line of curvature is spherical is that the angle between the conformal osculating plane and the tangent plane is constant along the curve.\n(3)\nIf one system of lines of curvature consists of conformal geodesics the other system consists of circles. There are also conditions that the normal circles of a surface all pass through a fixed point and studies of surfaces of which the normal circles form a normal congruence.\nThe certainty of geometry\n(1946)\n: Lecture at the Free University of Amsterdam.\nSymmetrization in the hyperbolic plane\n(1947)\n: According to\nSteiner\n, a closed curve is \"symmetrized\" by the process of shifting every section perpendicular to a given line till its midpoint lies on the line. This process diminishes the circumferenceÂ\nL\nL\nL\nÂ of any curve not symmetrical about the given line, while leaving the areaÂ\nO\nO\nO\nÂ unchanged. Hence any closed curve other than a circle yields a shorter closed curve for some direction of the line. The author considers, in the hyperbolic plane, a closed curve whose geodesic curvature is everywhere greater than\n1\nand shows that this property is retained after symmetrization.\nEquilateral point-sets in elliptic two- and three-dimensional spaces\n(1948)\n: A point set in a metric space is called equilateral if its pairs of different points have the same distance. A method is given for deriving all equilateralÂ n-tuples in elliptic space. In particular, in the elliptic plane there are equilateral sextuples, but no septuples. In three-dimensional space there are six kinds of\n(\nnoncongruent\n)\nequilateral quintuples, two kinds of sextuples and no septuples.\nPtolemy's theorem\n(1952)\n: IfÂ\np\n1\n,\np\n2\n,\np\n3\n,\np\n4\np_{1}, p_{2}, p_{3}, p_{4}\np\n1\nâ\n,\np\n2\nâ\n,\np\n3\nâ\n,\np\n4\nâ\nÂ are any four points of euclidean three-space, the\n(\nextended\n)\ntheorem of\nPtolemy\nasserts that the three products\nÂ Â Â Â Â\np\n1\np\n2\nÃ\np\n3\np\n4\n,\nÂ\np\n1\np\n3\nÃ\np\n2\np\n4\n,\nÂ\np\n1\np\n4\nÃ\np\n2\np\n3\np_{1}p_{2} \\times  p_{3}p_{4}, Â p_{1}p_{3} \\times  p_{2}p_{4}, Â p_{1}p_{4} \\times  p_{2}p_{3}\np\n1\nâ\np\n2\nâ\nÃ\np\n3\nâ\np\n4\nâ\n,\nÂ\np\n1\nâ\np\n3\nâ\nÃ\np\n2\nâ\np\n4\nâ\n,\nÂ\np\n1\nâ\np\n4\nâ\nÃ\np\n2\nâ\np\n3\nâ\nof opposite distances satisfy the triangle inequality, and the four points are concyclic if and only if the sum of two of these products equals the third. This note contains a purely metric proof of the theorem ...\nHaantjes also wrote the book\nInleiding tot de Differentiaalmeetkunde\nâ\n(\nIntroduction to differential geometry\n)\n(1954)\n.\nDirk Struik\nwrites in a review:-\nThis attractive book is an introduction to the classical differential geometry of curves and surfaces in euclidean three-dimensional space with the aid of the vector and the tensor calculus. In its seven chapters we find not only a clear and comprehensive exposition of such subjects as the\nFrenet\nformulas, the\nGauss\n-\nCodazzi\nequations and the\nGauss\n-\nBonnet\ntheorem, but also a short but adequate treatment of the elements of the analysis of vectors and tensors. These methods are introduced only at the place where they are needed for the geometrical demonstrations. Some special features are a sketch of\nBonnet\n's existence theorem for surfaces with given first and second fundamental tensors and a derivation of the\nGauss\n-\nBonnet\ntheorem based on the consideration of triangles of which two sides are geodesic. There are more than a hundred problems, with indications for their solution at the end, and thirty-five good illustrations.\nToday Haantjes is remembered by those working in metric geometry for the Haantjes-\nFinsler\ncurve. It is one of the many extensions of the standard concept of curvature, including applications to wavelets. The Haantjes-\nFinsler\ncurve is a metric notion of curvature suggested by\nPaul Finsler\nand developed by Haantjes in his paper\nDistance geometry. Curvature in abstract metric spaces\n(1947)\n.\nWillem van der Woude writes that at the University of Leiden, Haantjes\n[\n1\n]\n:-\n... was an excellent teacher ... He was greatly appreciated in the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics and in the Senate, also in the positions in which he performed outside of a university context. No wonder, he was kind and kind-hearted, knew what he wanted, but easily adapted to others. He had ecclesiastical and social interest, was a student elder of the Reformed Church and a member of the supervisory committee for secondary education in Leiden. He was known as a geometric expert of very general knowledge and as one of the best experts in differential geometry at all levels.\nHaantjes was a dedicated Christian who had many social interests. When in Leiden he was a student elder in the Reformed Church. After he moved to Amsterdam he held the office of elder of the Reformed Church. He was the secretary of the \"Free Courses\" of the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam until\n1953\n. He was also much involved with school mathematics examinations. He often acted as an examiner for the \"Lager Onderwijs\", the primary certificate, and for the \"Middelbaar Onderwijs\", the Hogere Burgerschool examination. He regularly attended international conferences, for example the Colloque de GÃ©omÃ©trie DiffÃ©rentielle, in Louvain in\n1951\n, publishing\nSur la gÃ©omÃ©trie infinitÃ©simale des espaces mÃ©triques\nâ\n(\nThe geometry of the infinitesimal descriptive space\n)\nin the\nProceedings\n, and the Convegno Internazionale di Geometria Differenziale, Italia,\n1953\n, publishing\nOn the notion of geometric object\nin the\nProceedings\n.\nAmong the honours he received, we mention his election to the\nRoyal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences\n(\nKoninklijke Nederlandse Akademie van Wetenschappen\n)\nin\n1952\n. He was also a member of the\nDutch Mathematical Society\n(\ntheÂ Koninklijke Wiskundig Genootschap\n)\nand served as its treasurer in the years\n1939\n-\n1955\n. In October\n1950\nthe Board of the\nKoninklijke Wiskundig Genootschap\nappointed a small committee with the task of drawing up a report on the structure and regulations for the International Congress of Mathematicians to be held in Amsterdam in\n1954\n.\nH D Kloosterman\nwas chair of this committee with Haantjes as its secretary. In\n1955\nhe was elected as president of the\nDutch Mathematical Society\nbut due to ill health he was soon forced to resign.\nIn\n1955\nhe received a request from the Clarendon Press to undertake the writing of a treatise on the foundations of differential geometry for publication in their Oxford Tracts series. This shows the strong international reputation that Haantjes had acquired. Sadly illness prevented him from writing this book. Around the middle of\n1955\nhe was rather tired when the summer vacation began but after that his health began to rapidly deteriorate. His last papers\nOnÂ\nX\nm\nX_{m}\nX\nm\nâ\n-forming sets of eigenvectors\nand\n(\nwith R Nottrot\n)\nDistance geometry. Directions in metric spaces. Torsion\nwere published in\n1955\n. Despite receiving the best medical help and the most loving nursing he died in February\n1956\nand was buried on\n11\nFebruary at the Rhijnhof Cemetery in Oegstgeest.",
