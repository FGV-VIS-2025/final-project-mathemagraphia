  "biografia": "Alfonso Del Re\nwas the son of Raffaele Del Re and Rosa Margotta. He was born in the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies at a time when major changes were occurring due to the move towards the unification of Italy. In\n1860\nAvellino became part of the Kingdom of Sardinia and the following year it became part of the Kingdom of Italy. Alfonso's father, Raffaele Del Re, was a tailor. Alfonso began his education in his home town but, when he was fifteen years old, he went to Naples to complete his secondary school studies. After graduating from a private high school in Naples, he entered the University of Naples.\nDel Re's first paper,\nRelazione tra due determinanti\nâ\n(\nRelationship between two determinants\n)\n, was published in the\nGiornale di Matematiche\n(\nBattaglini\n)\nin\n1881\n. Before completing his laurea he had a number of other papers published:\nLa quadrica dei dodici punti e la quadrica dei dodici piani\nâ\n(\nThe quadratic of the twelve points and the quadratic of the twelve planes\n)\n(1884)\n;\nOblique e circoli osculatori alle coniche in relazione tra loro ed in relazione con altri elementi geometrici di cui sono casi particolari\nâ\n(\nOblique and osculating circles at conics in relation to each other and in relation to other particular cases of geometric elements\n)\n(1884)\n, and\nSulle funzioni di forza\nâ\n(\nOn the functions of force\n)\n(1885)\n. These were substantial pieces of work having\n15\npages,\n43\npages and\n13\npages respectively.\nFor a list of Del Re's publications, see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nIn\n1885\n, still one year away from completing his laurea, he was appointed as an assistant to the Chair of Projective Geometry at Naples. He was awarded his laurea in\n1886\nand continued teaching at the University of Naples. In\n1889\nhe moved to the university of Rome where he again worked as an assistant.\nDel Re began to enter competitions for professorships. In\n1891\nhe entered the competition for the extraordinary professorship in analytic and projective geometry at the University of Rome. A committee consisting of\nEugenio Bertini\n,\nEnrico D'Ovidio\nand\nGiuseppe Veronese\nconsidered six candidates, ranking\nGuido Castelnuovo\nin first position with\n49\n/\n50\npoints, Del Re second with\n46\n/\n50\nand in joint third place,\nLuigi Berzolari\nand\nMario Pieri\nwith\n39\n/\n50\n. In November\n1892\n, having won the contest to hold an extraordinary professorship in projective and analytic geometry at the University of Modena, he began teaching there. However, he continued to apply for professorships that became vacant over the following few years.\nIn\n1893\nDel Re entered the competition for the chair of projective geometry at the University of Naples. This was won by\nDomenico Montesano\n, who had previously held a chair in Bologna, with\n45\n/\n50\npoints. Second was\nLuigi Berzolari\nwith\n44\n/\n50\n, third Del Re with\n43\n/\n50\nand fourth\nMario Pieri\nwith\n41\n/\n50\n. The next competition was also in\n1893\nfor the chair of projective and descriptive geometry at the University of Turin. This had become vacant when\nGiuseppe Bruno\ndied in February\n1893\n. The referees for this chair were Ferdinando Aschieri\n(1844\n-\n1907)\n,\nEugenio Bertini\n,\nEnrico D'Ovidio\n,\nCorrado Segre\nand\nGiuseppe Veronese\n.\nLuigi Berzolari\nwas appointed, ranked first with\n45\n/\n50\npoints, second equal were Del Re and\nMario Pieri\nwith\n41\n/\n50\npoints.\nWhen\nDomenico Montesano\nwon the competition for the chair at Naples in\n1893\n, he moved from the University of Bologna leaving vacant the extraordinary professorship in descriptive and projective geometry there. What followed was a drawn out battle for the position which is now known as the \"Bologna Affair.\" Given the results of the two earlier competitions, Del Re and\nPieri\nwere considered the leading candidates. The faculty at Bologna, encouraged by\nPincherle\n, decided that they wished to appoint\nPieri\nwithout a competition. The minister of education, however, did not approve\nPieri\n's appointment, telling the Faculty at Bologna that they had to hold a competition and make a temporary appointment while this was taking place.\nFederigo Enriques\nwas appointed to the temporary post in January\n1894\n. With no competition announced, Del Re made a request to the minister of education that he be transferred from the University of Modena to Bologna for family reasons. Since by this time Del Re held a full chair in Modena and was requesting a move to an extraordinary position at Bologna, this seemed a strong request. The Faculty at Bologna repeatedly requested the minister to hold a competition but no competition was held. The minister replied to the Faculty that he could not accept their request for a competition and saw no reason not to appoint Del Re and said he would appoint him immediately if the Faculty agreed.\nEnriques\n, keen to remain at Bologna, asked\nCastelnuovo\nto intervene and make sure the minister did not agree to Del Re's request. With no competition taking place, the Faculty at Bologna reappointed\nEnriques\nfor another temporary year in January\n1895\n. It then became clear that there were three candidates with strong cases,\nEnriques\n, Del Re and\nPieri\nand the Faculty requested the minister to set a commission to decide between these three without opening a competition. The Faculty at Bologna now split with\nArzelÃ\nfavouring Del Re's transfer with\nPincherle\nand others opposed.\nEnriques\nwas appointed for yet another temporary year, the year\n1896\n. Just before the Faculty meeting in November\n1895\nwhich made that decision,\nEnriques\nhad written\n[\n3\n]\n:-\n... lamenting the number of recommendation letters that Del Re had secured, and complaining that Del Re was always there lobbying and had gained so much ground that\nPincherle\nfeared a major coup. Del Re was arguing that he needed to relocate his family to Bologna. He had even approached\nEnriques\nhimself asking for support and offering to help secure for\nEnriques\nthe position he would vacate at Modena!\nThe \"Bologna Affair\" ended in\n1896\nwhen the minister resigned after a crisis following the Battle of Adwa, and a new minister was appointed who immediately opened a competition.\nEnriques\nwas appointed but Del Re does not appear to have entered the competition. In\n1899\nDel Re went back to the University of Naples when he was appointed to the Chair of Descriptive Geometry at the Institute of Mathematics. He held this chair until his death.\nLet us now follow\n[\n7\n]\nin describing Del Re's mathematical contributions.\nBecause of his versatility and his in-depth studies in many fields of the exact sciences, he was able to obtain important results which he presented in one hundred and twenty five publications. His research developed in many directions. It comprised studies of pure and applied geometry as well as analytic and projective geometry\n(\nLezioni di geometria proiettiva e analitica\nâ\n(\nProjective and analytical geometry lessons\n)\n, Modena\n1894)\n, studies of algebra\n(\nSopra certe relazioni di identitÃ  fra determinant e matrici\nâ\n(\nOn some identity relations between determinants and matrices\n)\n, Naples\n1916)\n, of symbolic analysis of forms\n(\nLezioni sulle forme fondamentali dello spazio rigato, sulla dottrina degli immaginari e sui metodi di rappresentazione nella geometria descrittiva\nâ\n(\nLectures on fundamental forms on ruled space, on the doctrine of the imaginaries and on the methods of representation in descriptive geometry\n)\n, ibid.\n1906)\n, works on statics, kinematics and dynamics, on the space of three and four dimensions\n(\nSulla statica dello spazio a\n4\ndimensioni\nâ\n(\nOn the statics of space in\n4\ndimensions\n)\n, Roma\n1908)\nas well as spaces of\nn\ndimensions, for any\nn\nand constant curvature\n(\nLe equazioni generali per la statica e dinamica dei sistemi materiali ad n dimensioni ed a curvature costante nell'analisi di Grassmann\nâ\n(\nThe general equations for the statics and dynamics of material systems of n dimensions and constant curvature in the analysis of Grassmann\n)\n, ibid.\n1912\n;\nLe equazioni generali per la dinamica dei corpi rigidi ad n dimensioni ed a curvature costante nell'analisi di Grassmann\nâ\n(\nThe general equations for the dynamics of rigid bodies of n dimensions and of constant curvature in the analysis of Grassmann\n)\n, Naples\n1915)\n, according to the most advanced position at the time and in close competition with research at the international level, oriented towards an algebraic and formal formulation and with an impetus from the geometry of\nJ J Sylvester\n,\nK G von Staudt\n,\nW R Hamilton\nand even\nD Hilbert\n. In all of these fields he focused, with a modern spirit and according to a formal set-up, on explaining the results obtained from other authors, mostly foreign authors, rather than producing entirely new results himself.\nDel Re also worked on the algebra of logic in the period of the great\nexploit\n, taking place at the end of the last century; his lectures on the discipline\n(\nLezioni di algebra della logica\nâ\n(\nLectures on the algebra of logic\n)\n, Napoli\n1907)\n, which he gave in Naples, were then published and obtained unanimous approval in Italy and abroad\n(\ncf. B A Bernstein,\nPostulati per la logica delle classi in termini della operazione \"eccezione\", e pruova dell'indipendenza dei postulate dovuti a Del Re\nâ\n(\nPostulates for class logic in terms of the 'not-if' operation, and the independence of the postulates due to Del Re\n)\n, Napoli\n1918)\n. They occupy a pre-eminent place within the publications in the field both for the originality of their content and for the way in which the treatment of the subject is carried out following an axiomatic approach. Furthermore, Del Re also took an interest in natural philosophy, which towards the end of the last century\n(\nthe\n19\nth century\n)\nwas an object of many studies based on the dominant position of positivism. About this, we recall the address he gave in the November of\n1896\nat the inauguration of the academic year of the University of Modena, titled:\nSulla struttura geometrica dello spazio in relazione al modo di percepire i fatti naturali\nâ\n(\nOn the geometric structure of space in relation to the way of perceiving natural events\n)\n(\nNaples\n1901)\n. Here he anticipated the relativistic theory in general terms, tackling arguments which were then developed by\nAlbert Einstein\n. In particular, he worked on the mathematical aspect of the theory of relativity, treating analytically a particular type of transformations of\nH A Lorentz\n(\nSulle trasformazioni Voigt-Lorentz in elettrodinamica\nâ\n(\nOn the Voigt-Lorentz transformations in electrodynamics\n)\n, ibid.\n1913)\n.\nDel Re was fellow of a number of academies, among which were the Academy of Sciences of Naples and the Pontiniana Academy.\nWe add a few more details. First we note the mathematical models described in\n[\n5\n]\n:-\nEquipped with its own organic and very fine workmanship was the small collection developed by Alfonso Del Re in the Room of Descriptive Geometry attached to the corresponding chair of which he was the professor. Del Re also mentions this in 'The programme of the course and programme of the examination for the academic year\n1906\n-\n1907\n', where the list of geometric models, constructed between\n1901\nand\n1906\nby the students of the School of Descriptive Geometry of the University of Naples, is presented. There are\n36\nmodels, of which thirty-one are in wood and wire, three in wood and brass, and two in wood, brass and horsehair. In this fine collection, the frames - generally called \"castles\" - which held the natural fibres of the striped surfaces represented, were made of artistically worked wood using a fretwork technique.\nGiovanni Acocella discusses Del Re's\nCorso di Algebra della Logica\nâ\n(\nCourse in algebra of logic\n)\nin\n[\n4\n]\n:-\nThe 'Course of Algebra of Logic' published in Naples in\n1907\nby professor Alfonso M Del Re was the subject of extensive quotations, especially by some American scholars. I talked about this course, which took place regularly in the four years preceding its publication, at the previous Congress of the SISM in Alba. Del Re's course followed the path traced out by\nErnst SchrÃ¶der\nand took into account the complete set of independent postulates for class logic which were first set out by\nEdward Huntington\nin July\n1904\n. With a later\n1911\nmemoir, Alfonso Del Re illustrated a series of arguments on the independence of his series of postulates, in addition to those implicit in the reference to Huntington. B A Bernstein in a paper read before the\nAmerican Mathematical Society\n(\nin San Francisco\n)\non\n25\nOctober\n1913\n, after quoting the contributions of\nCharles Peirce\n,\nEdward Huntington\nand\nH M Sheffer\n, proposed a series of postulates of completion in terms of the operation \"exception\". Bernstein himself deduced the sufficiency of these from the series of postulates indicated by A Del Re in his 'Logical Algebra', adding new evidence to those implicit in the reference to\nHuntington\n. In a postscript to an Italian translation of\n1918\n, Dr Rosaria Giordano reports on the content of the letter that Bernstein himself sent to Del Re on\n8\nApril\n1917\n. In the same postscript he took note of a small necessary change, advising that all that remains is the integration of the reading of the text of 'Algebra della Logica' with the reading of the Memoir of Del Re of\n1911\n.\nFinally we note that Abbagnano, a famous philosopher, married Del Re's daughter Rosa Del Re in\n1924\n, three years after Del Re's death.",
