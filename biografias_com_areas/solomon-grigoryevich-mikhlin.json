  "biografia": "Solomon Grigoryevich Mikhlin\nwas born in Kholmech, a Belorussian village, into a Jewish family of modest means: his real name was Zalman Girshevich Mikhlin, and he was the youngest of five children. In the document\n[\n12\n]\nhe states that his father was a petty trader. However, this could be untrue since people of his generation sometimes lied about the profession of their parents in order to avoid limitations in their access to higher education. A different version, reported in\n[\n10\n]\n, states that S G Mikhlin's father was a melamed\n(\na teacher of religion\n)\nat a primary religious school\n(\nkheder\n)\n. His first wife was Victoria Isaevna Libina. In\n1940\nthey adopted a son, Grigory Zalmanovich.\n(\nDetails of S G Mikhlin's family and his student years can be found in reminiscences of Grigory Z Mikhlin\n[\n11\n]\n.\n)\nVictoria died of peritonitis in\n1961\nduring a boat trip on the Volga - apparently, there had been no doctor on board. The book\n[\n1\n]\nis dedicated to her memory. Later S G  Mikhlin married Eugenia Yakovlevna Rubinova, born in\n1918\n, who became his companion throughout the rest of his life.\nHe graduated from a secondary school in Gomel\n(\nBelorussia\n)\nin\n1923\nand entered the Leningrad State Pedagogical Institute, named after Herzen, in\n1925\n. In January\n1927\nhe became a second year student in the Department of Mathematics and Mechanics\n(\nMatMekh\n)\nof Leningrad State University after passing all the first year examinations without attending any lectures.\nSergei Lvovich Sobolev\nstudied in the same class as Mikhlin. Among their university professors were Nikolai Maximovich GÃ¼nther and\nVladimir Ivanovich Smirnov\n. The latter became Mikhlin's master thesis supervisor: the topic of the thesis, defended in\n1929\n, was the convergence of double power series. In\n1930\nhe started his teaching career, working for short periods in several Leningrad institutes. In\n1932\nhe obtained a position at the Seismological Institute of the\nUSSR Academy of Sciences\n, where he worked till\n1941\n. He was awarded the degree of \"Doktor nauk\" in Mathematics and Physics in\n1935\n(\nequivalent to the Doctor of Science\n)\n, without having to earn the \"Kandidat nauk\" degree\n(\nequivalent to a Ph.D.\n)\n, and finally in\n1937\nhe was promoted to the rank of professor. During World War II he was a professor at the State Alma Ata University\n(\nKazakhstan\n)\n. In\n1944\nMikhlin returned to Leningrad State University as full professor. From\n1964\nto\n1986\nhe headed the Laboratory of Numerical Methods at the Research Institute of Mathematics and Mechanics of the same university. From\n1986\nuntil his death Mikhlin continued as a senior researcher at that laboratory.\n(\nAn interesting source of information about Mikhlin's laboratory is the article by M Anolik\n[\n2\n]\n.\n)\nIn\n1966\nMiklin and\nMaz'ya\nlaunched a Tuesday seminar on integral and partial differential equations at MatMekh. Both beginners and well established mathematicians gave two-hour talks. Among invited speakers were Mark Krasnoselsky,\nIsrael Gohberg\n, Alexander Dynin, Igor Simonenko, Mark Freidlin,\nOlga Oleinik\n, and also foreign visitors GÃ¼nther Wildenhain, Lars-Inge Hedberg, Siegfried PrÃ¶ssdorf and Gaetano Fichera. When the Department of Mathematics and Mechanics moved to the Leningrad suburb of Peterhof in\n1978\n, the seminar became more specialized, turning into the seminar of Mikhlin's laboratory on numerical methods.\nIn\n1961\nMikhlin received the State Order of the Badge of Honour. He was awarded the Laurea honoris causa by the Karl-Marx-Stadt\n(\nnow Chemnitz\n)\nPolytechnic University in\n1968\n. He was also elected to membership of two academies, the German\nAcademy of Sciences Leopoldina\nin\n1970\nand the\nAccademia Nazionale dei Lincei\nin\n1981\n, but, according to Gaetano Fichera\n[\n6\n]\n, in the USSR Mikhlin never received honours befitting his scientific stature, mainly due of the anti-Semitic policy of the communist regime.\nHe lived during the period of contemporary Russian history when the Communist party ideology ruled academic life. Local administrators and party functionaries interfered with scientists on either ethnic or ideological grounds. Every citizen's ethnicity was specified in his/her passport and always taken into account by academic authorities. Frequently, ethnic Jews could not enter prestigious departments of universities to study for scientific degrees. They were not allowed to travel and publish abroad, they were not included\n(\nwith a few exceptions\n)\nin official delegations for international conferences and congresses. Even their publications were discriminated by the editorial boards of the best Soviet journals.\nAs a matter of fact, before and during World War II, as well as in the first decade after it, Mikhlin did not experience difficulties on the same scale as younger Jewish Soviet mathematicians did from the mid-\n1960\ns. He could travel to countries of the Eastern European block and even was a member of the Soviet delegation at the\n1958\nInternational Congress of Mathematicians in Edinburgh, Scotland. He was a full professor of the University, a permanent member of the Scientific Board at MatMekh, and the head of a laboratory. Nevertheless, he strongly felt the general anti-Semitic atmosphere. \"They have power but we have theorems. In them is our strength\", Mikhlin once said, as reported by\nVladimir Maz'ya\n.\nFichera, examining Mikhlin's life in\n[\n6\n]\n, finds it surprisingly similar to the life of\nVito Volterra\nunder the fascist regime. He notes that anti-Semitism in communist countries took different forms compared to its Nazi counterparts. The communist regime did not resort to brutal mass homicide of Jews, but imposed on them a number of restrictions, making their life difficult. During the period from\n1963\nto\n1981\n, Fichera met Mikhlin at several conferences in the Soviet Union, and realised that he was in a state of isolation, later describing several episodes revealing this. Perhaps, the most illuminating example is the election of Mikhlin into the\nAccademia dei Lincei\n. As already mentioned, in June\n1981\n, Solomon G Mikhlin was elected a Foreign Member of the class of Mathematical Sciences of the\nAcademy\n. However, at first he was nominated to receive the Antonio Feltrinelli Prize. The anticipated likely confiscation of the prize money by Soviet authorities spurred Italian academicians \"to honour him in a different way, which could not be expropriated by any political authority\", as Fichera\n[\n6\n]\nreports. Thus, Mikhlin was elected as a Foreign Member of the\nAcademy\n. Mikhlin was subsequently not allowed to visit Italy by the Soviet authorities\n(\nthis episode is also remembered by\nVladimir G Maz'ya\n, see\n[\n9\n]\n)\n, so Fichera and his wife brought the tiny golden lynx badge, the symbol of the\nAccademia dei Lincei\nmembership, directly to Mikhlin's apartment in Leningrad on\n17\nOctober\n1981\n. The only guests of that \"ceremony\" were\nVladimir Maz'ya\nand his wife Tatyana Shaposhnikova.\nThe circumstances of Mikhlin's death are described by Gaetano Fichera in\n[\n6\n]\n, who refers to a conversation with Mark Vishik and\nOlga Oleinik\n. On the\n29\nth\nof August\n1990\n, Mikhlin left home to buy medicines for his wife Eugenia. On public transport, he suffered a lethal stroke. He had no documents with him, therefore he was identified only some time after his death - this may be the cause of different dates of death reported in several biographies and obituary notices. Mikhlin's wife Eugenia survived him by only a few months.\nComprehensive descriptions of Mikhlin's work appear in the papers\n[\n6\n]\n,\n[\n7\n]\nand in the references cited therein. Considering his research activity, perhaps, one of the first things to note is that he was the author of monographs and textbooks which became classics for their style. His main contributions belong to elasticity theory and elliptic boundary value problems, singular integrals and\nFourier\nmultipliers, as well as numerical mathematics.\nIn mathematical elasticity theory, Mikhlin was concerned with three themes: the plane problem\n(\nmainly from\n1932\nto\n1935)\n, the theory of shells\n(\nfrom\n1954)\nand the\nCosserat\nspectrum\n(\nfrom\n1967\nto\n1973)\n. Dealing with the plane elasticity problem, he proposed two methods for its solution in multiply connected domains. The first one is based upon the so-called complex\nGreen\n's function and the reduction of the related boundary value problem to integral equations. The second method is a certain generalisation of the classical Schwarz algorithm for the solution of the\nDirichlet\nproblem in a given domain by reducing it to simpler problems in smaller domains whose union is the original one. Mikhlin studied its convergence and gave applications to special applied problems. He proved existence theorems for the fundamental problems of plane elasticity involving inhomogeneous anisotropic media. Concerning the theory of shells, there are several Mikhlin's articles dealing with it. He studied the error of the approximate solution for shells, similar to plane plates, and found out that this error is small for the so-called purely rotational state of stress. As a result of his study of this problem, Mikhlin also gave a new invariant form of the basic equations of the theory. He also proved a theorem on perturbations of positive operators in a\nHilbert space\nwhich let him to obtain an error estimate for the problem of approximating a sloping shell by a plane plate. Mikhlin studied also the spectrum of the operator pencil of the classical\nNavier\n-\nCauchy\noperator i.e. the\nCosserat\nspectrum. The full description of this spectrum and the proof of the completeness of the system of eigenfunctions are also due to Mikhlin, and partly to\nVladimir G Maz'ya\nin their only joint work.\nPerhaps, his most important contributions are his works on the theory of singular integral operators and singular\nintegral equations\n: he is one of the founders of the multi-dimensional theory, jointly with\nFrancesco Tricomi\nand Georges Giraud. Such integral operators are called \"singular\" since the singularity of their kernel is so strong that the integral does not exist in the ordinary sense, but only in the sense of the\nCauchy\nprincipal value. Mikhlin was the first to develop a theory of singular integral equations as a theory of operator equations in function spaces\nL\n2\nL_{2}\nL\n2\nâ\n. In\n1936\nhe found a rule for the composition of double singular integrals\n(\ni.e. in the Euclidean plane\n)\nand introduced the fundamental notion of the symbol of a singular integral. This enabled him to prove that the algebra of bounded singular integral operators is isomorphic to the algebra of either scalar or matrix-valued functions. He established\nFredholm\n's theorems for singular integral equations and systems of such equations under the hypothesis of non-degeneracy of the symbol. He also proved that the index of a single singular integral equation in the Euclidean space is zero.\nIn\n1961\nMikhlin developed a theory of multidimensional singular integral equations on\nLipschitz\nspaces which are widely used in the theory of one-dimensional singular integral equations. However, a direct extension of the related theory to the multidimensional case meets some technical difficulties, and Mikhlin suggested another approach to this problem. Namely, he obtained basic properties of this kind of singular integral equations as a by-product of the\nL\np\nL_{p}\nL\np\nâ\n-space theory of these equations. Mikhlin also proved a now classical theorem on multipliers of\nFourier\ntransform in the\nL\np\nL_{p}\nL\np\nâ\n-space, based on an analogous theorem of\nJÃ³zef Marcinkiewicz\non\nFourier\nseries. A complete collection of his results in this field up to\n1965\n, as well as contributions by\nFrancesco Tricomi\n, Georges Giraud,\nAlberto CalderÃ³n\nand\nAntoni Zygmund\n, is contained in the monograph\n[\n1\n]\n. Fichera\n[\n6\n]\nremarks that Mikhlin, with his discoveries in singular integral operators, was a forerunner of the theory of pseudo-differential operators developed by Joseph J Kohn,\nLouis Nirenberg\n,\nLars HÃ¶rmander\nand others. Mikhlin's multiplier theorem is widely used in different branches of mathematical analysis, particularly in the theory of differential equations.\nFour Mikhlin papers, published in the period\n1940\n-\n1942\n, deal with applications of the method of potentials to the mixed problem for the wave equation. In particular, he solved the mixed problem for the two-space dimensional wave equation in the half-plane by reduction to the planar\nAbel\nintegral equation. For a planar domain with a sufficiently smooth curvilinear boundary, he reduced the problem to an integro-differential equation, which he is able to solve when the given boundary is analytic. In\n1951\nMikhlin proved the convergence of the Schwarz alternating method for second order elliptic equations. He also applied methods of\nfunctional analysis\n, at the same time as Mark Vishik but independently of him, to the investigation of boundary value problems for degenerate second order elliptic partial differential equations.\nHe was, again citing Fichera\n[\n6\n]\n, one of the pioneers of modern numerical analysis together with\nBoris Galerkin\n,\nAlexander Ostrowski\n,\nJohn von Neumann\n, Walter Ritz and Mauro Picone. His work in the field of numerical analysis can be divided into several branches. The first branch deals with the study of convergence of variational methods for problems connected with positive operators, in particular, for some problems of mathematical physics. Both \"a priori\" and \"posteriori\" estimates of the errors concerning the approximation given by these methods are obtained by him. The second branch deals with the notion of stability of numerical processes introduced by Mikhlin himself. When applied to the variational method, this notion enabled him to state necessary and sufficient conditions in order to minimise errors in the solution of the given problem when the error arising in the numerical construction of the algebraic system resulting from the application of the method itself is sufficiently small, no matter how large is the system's order. The third branch is the study of variational-difference and finite element methods. Mikhlin investigated the completeness of the coordinate functions used in these methods in the\nSobolev\nspace\nW\n{\n1\n,\nÂ\np\n}\nW^{\\{1,Â p\\}}\nW\n{\n1\n,\nÂ\np\n}\n, deriving the order of approximation as a function of the smoothness properties of the functions to be approximated. He also characterised the class of coordinate functions which give the best order of approximation, and studied the stability of the variational-difference process and the growth of the condition number of the variation-difference matrix. Mikhlin also studied the finite element approximation in weighted\nSobolev\nspaces related to the numerical solution of degenerate elliptic equations. He found the optimal order of approximation for some methods of solution of variational inequalities. The fourth branch of his research in numerical mathematics is a method for solving\nFredholm\nintegral equations which he called the \"resolvent method\". Its essence relies on the possibility of substituting the kernel of the integral operator by its variational-difference approximation, so that the resolvent of the new kernel can be expressed by simple recurrence formulae. This eliminates the need to construct and solve large systems of equations. During his last years, Mikhlin contributed to the theory of errors in numerical processes, proposing the following classification of errors.\n1\n.\nApproximation error\n: is the error due to the replacement of an exact problem by an approximating one.\n2\n.\nPerturbation error\n: is the error due to the inaccuracies in the computation of the data of the approximating problem.\n3\n.\nAlgorithm error\n: is the intrinsic error of the algorithm used for the solution of the approximating problem.\n4\n.\nRounding error\n: is the error due to the limits of computer arithmetics.\nThis classification is useful since it enables one to develop computational methods aiming to diminish the errors of each particular type, following the \"divide et impera\" principle.\nAn active teacher, Mikhlin was the \"Kandidat nauk\" advisor of a number of mathematicians. A partial list of them includes Yuri K Dem'yanovich, Vladimir L Fomin, Lyudmila N Gagen-Torn\n(\nDovbysh\n)\n, Joseph A Itskovich, Anatolii E Kosulin, Arno Langenbach, Natalia M Mikhailova-Gubenko, Boris A Plamenevsky, Siegfried PrÃ¶ssdorf, R K Radeva, Vera D Sapozhnikova, Tatyana O Shaposhnikova, and Irina V Tsaritsina.\nMikhlin was also a mentor and friend of\nVladimir Maz'ya\n. He did not play the role of official supervisor, but his friendship with the young undergraduate\nMaz'ya\nhad a great influence on Vladimir's mathematical style.",
