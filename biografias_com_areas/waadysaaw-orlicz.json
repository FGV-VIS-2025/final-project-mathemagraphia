  "biografia": "WÅadysÅaw Roman Orlicz\nwas born in Okocim, a village near Cracow. His parents, Franciszek and Maria nÃ©e Rossknecht, had five sons. His father died when he was only four years old.\nIn\n1919\nOrlicz's family moved to LwÃ³w\n(\nwhich is now Lviv in Ukraine\n)\n, where he completed his secondary education and then studied mathematics at the Jan Kazimierz University in LwÃ³w having\nStefan Banach\n,\nHugo Steinhaus\nand Antoni Lomnicki as teachers.\nFrom\n1922\nto\n1929\nhe worked as a teaching assistent at the Department of Mathematics of Jan Kazimierz University in LwÃ³w. In\n1928\nhe wrote his doctoral thesis\nSome problems in the theory of orthogonal series\nunder the supervision of\nEustachy Å»yliÅski\n. In the same year he married Zofia Krzysik. In the late twenties and early thirties Orlicz worked as a teacher in private secondary schools and in a military school.\nOrlicz spent the academic year\n1929\n/\n30\nat GÃ¶ttingen University on a scholarship in theoretical physics, not in mathematics. During his stay in GÃ¶ttingen he started his collaboration with\nZygmunt Wilhelm Birnbaum\n(\nalso from LwÃ³w\n)\n. They published two papers in\nStudia Mathematica\nin\n1930\nand\n1931\n. Their results became a starting point for Orlicz to consider and investigate in\n1932\nand\n1936\nfunction spaces more general than\nL\np\nL^{p}\nL\np\nspaces which later on became known as\nOrlicz spaces\n.\nIt should be emphasized that from the\nfunctional analysis\npoint of view\n(\nthat is, as function spaces\n)\nOrlicz spaces appeared for the first time in\n1932\nin Orlicz's paper:\nÃber eine gewisse Klasse von RÃ¤umen vom Typus B\nâ\n(\nOn a certain class of spaces of type B\n)\nin\nBull. Int. Acad. Polon. Sci\n. A\n1932\n,\n8\n/\n9\n,\n207\n-\n220\nwith an additional condition on the function\n(\nthe so called\nÎ\n2\n\\Delta _{2}\nÎ\n2\nâ\n-condition for large\nu\nu\nu\n)\n, and in full generality\n(\nthat is, without the\nÎ\n2\n\\Delta _{2}\nÎ\n2\nâ\n-condition\n)\nin\n1936\n.\nIn the years\n1931\n-\n1937\nOrlicz worked at the LwÃ³w Technical University. In\n1934\nhe was granted the\nhabilitation\n(\nvenia legendi\n)\nfor a thesis entitled\nInvestigations of orthogonal systems\n.\nWorking in LwÃ³w Orlicz participated in the famous meetings at the Scottish CafÃ©\n(\nKawiarnia Szkocka\n)\nwhere\nStefan Banach\n,\nHugo Steinhaus\n,\nStanisÅaw Ulam\n,\nStanisÅaw Mazur\n,\nMarek Kac\n,\nJuliusz Schauder\n,\nStefan Kaczmarz\nand many others talked about mathematical problems and looked for their solutions. The group gained international recognition and was later described as the\nLwÃ³w School of Mathematics\n.\nA collection of\n193\nmathematical problems from meetings at the Scottish CafÃ© appeared later on as the\nScottish Book\n. Orlicz is the author or co-author of\n14\nproblems there.\n(\nR D Mauldin edited\nThe Scottish Book, Mathematics from the Scottish CafÃ©\n(\nBirkhÃ¤user\n1981)\nwhich contains problems and also commentaries on them by specialists\n)\n.\nYou can see a picture of the Scottish CafÃ© at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nIn\n1968\nwhen presenting the mathematical output of\nSteinhaus\n(\nin an article published in\nWiadom. Mat\n. in\n1969)\n, Orlicz wrote:-\nIn LwÃ³w under the leadership of our dear masters\nBanach\nand\nSteinhaus\nwe were practising intricacies of mathematics.\nIn\n1937\nOrlicz became a professor at PoznaÅ University\n(\nnow Adam Mickiewicz University\n)\nand spent the Second World War in LwÃ³w. He was professor at the State University of Iwan Franko from January\n1940\nto June\n1941\nand from August\n1944\nto February\n1945\nhe also taught at the school of commerce and handicrafts and lectured at forestry courses. In March\n1945\nOrlicz went back to Poland and in May\n1945\nhe returned to University of PoznaÅ. In July\n1948\nOrlicz was promoted to an ordinary professorship.\nUntil his retirement in\n1974\nhe worked both at the University of PoznaÅ and the Mathematical Institute of the\nPolish Academy of Sciences\n, PoznaÅ Branch. Orlicz continued his seminar\nSelected Problems of Functional Analysis\nuntil\n1989\n. The seminar ran every Wednesday from half past twelve to two o'clock in Mathematical Institute. He was interested in works of other mathematicians and in branches far removed from functional analysis.\nOrlicz collaborated with several mathematicians. Collaboration with\nMazur\nwas especially fruitful. They wrote a dozen joint papers and their results are now considered classical theorems. When in\n1960\nSteinhaus\nwas writing about\nBanach\nhe emphasised this fact\n(\nNauka Polska\n8\n(4)\n(1960)\n,\n157\nor\nWiadom. Mat\n.\n4\n(1961)\n,\n257\nor\n[\n2\n]\n,\n242)\n:-\nMazur\nand Orlicz are direct pupils of\nBanach\n; they represent the theory of operations today in Poland and their names on the cover of \"Studia Mathematica\" indicate direct continuation of\nBanach\n's scientific program.\nAltogether Orlicz published\n171\nmathematical papers, about half of them in cooperation with several authors. He was the supervisor of\n39\ndoctoral dissertations and over\n500\nmaster's theses.\nOrlicz participated in congresses of mathematics in Oslo\n(1936)\n, Edinburgh\n(1958)\n, Stockholm\n(1962)\nand Warsaw\n(1983)\n, and in many scientific conferences. He was invited to universities in Canada, China, Germany and Israel.\nHis book\nLinear Functional Analysis\n,\n(\nPeking\n1963\n,\n138\npp - in Chinese\n)\n, based on a series of lectures delivered in German on selected topics of functional analysis at the Institute of Mathematics of the\nAcademia Sinica\nin Beijing in\n1958\n, was translated into English and published in\n1992\nby World Scientific, Singapore. Orlicz is also a co-author of two school textbooks.\nOrlicz was the editor of\nCommentationes Mathematicae\n(1955\n-\n1990)\n, and of\nStudia Mathematica\n(1962\n-\n1990)\n, and President of the\nPolish Mathematical Society\n(1977\n-\n1979)\n.\nIn\n1956\nOrlicz was elected a corresponding-member of the\nPolish Academy of Sciences\nand in\n1961\nits full member. Three universities\n(\nYork University in Canada, PoznaÅ Technical University and Adam Mickiewicz University in PoznaÅ\n)\nconferred upon him the title of doctor\nhonoris causa\n, in\n1974\n,\n1978\nand\n1983\n, respectively.\nOrlicz was awarded many high state decorations, prizes as well as medals of scientific institutions and societies, including the\nStefan Banach\nPrize of the\nPolish Mathematical Society\n(1948)\n, the Golden Cross of Merit\n(1954)\n, the Commander's Cross of Polonia Restituta Order\n(1958)\n, Honorary Membership of the\nPolish Mathematical Society\n(1973)\n, the Alfred Jurzykowski Foundation Award\n(1973)\n,\nCopernicus\nMedal of the\nPolish Academy of Sciences\n(1973)\n, Order of Distinguished Teacher\n(1977)\n,\nWacÅaw SierpiÅski\nMedal of the Warsaw University\n(1979)\n, Medal of the Commission for National Education\n(1983)\nand the Individual State Prizes\n(\nsecond degree in\n1952\n, first degree in\n1966)\n.\nOrlicz's contribution is important in the following areas in mathematics: function spaces\n(\nmainly\nOrlicz spaces\n)\n, orthogonal series, unconditional convergence in Banach spaces, summability, vector-valued functions, metric locally convex spaces, Saks spaces, real functions,\nmeasure theory\nand integration, polynomial operators and modular spaces.\nOrlicz spaces\nL\nÏ\n=\nL\nÏ\n(\nÎ©\n,\nÎ£\n,\nÎ¼\n)\nL^{\\phi} = L^{\\phi} (\\Omega , \\Sigma , \\mu)\nL\nÏ\n=\nL\nÏ\n(\nÎ©\n,\nÎ£\n,\nÎ¼\n)\nare Banach spaces consisting of all\nx\nâ\nL\n0\n(\nÎ©\n,\nÎ£\n,\nÎ¼\n)\nx \\in  L^{0}(\\Omega , \\Sigma , \\mu)\nx\nâ\nL\n0\n(\nÎ©\n,\nÎ£\n,\nÎ¼\n)\nsuch that\nâ«\nÎ©\nÏ\n(\nÎ»\nâ£\nx\n(\nt\n)\nâ£\n)\nd\nÎ¼\n(\nt\n)\n<\nâ\n\\int _{\\Omega } \\phi(\\lambda|x(t)|)d\\mu(t) < â\nâ«\nÎ©\nâ\nÏ\n(\nÎ»\nâ£\nx\n(\nt\n)\nâ£\n)\nd\nÎ¼\n(\nt\n)\n<\nâ\nfor some\nÎ»\n=\nÎ»\n(\nx\n)\n>\n0\n\\lambda = \\lambda(x) > 0\nÎ»\n=\nÎ»\n(\nx\n)\n>\n0\nwith the\nOrlicz norm\n:\nâ£\nâ£\nx\nâ£\nâ£\nÏ\n0\n|| x ||^{0}_{\\phi}\nâ£\nâ£\nx\nâ£\nâ£\nÏ\n0\nâ\n= sup\n{\nâ«\nÎ©\nâ£\nx\n(\nt\n)\ny\n(\nt\n)\nâ£\nd\nÎ¼\n(\nt\n)\n:\nâ«\nÎ©\nÏ\nâ\n(\nâ£\ny\n(\nt\n)\nâ£\n)\nd\nÎ¼\n(\nt\n)\nâ¤\n1\n}\n\\{\\int _{\\Omega } |x(t)y(t)|d\\mu(t) : \\int _{\\Omega } \\phi^{^{*}}(|y(t)|)d\\mu(t) â¤ 1 \\}\n{\nâ«\nÎ©\nâ\nâ£\nx\n(\nt\n)\ny\n(\nt\n)\nâ£\nd\nÎ¼\n(\nt\n)\n:\nâ«\nÎ©\nâ\nÏ\nâ\n(\nâ£\ny\n(\nt\n)\nâ£\n)\nd\nÎ¼\n(\nt\n)\nâ¤\n1\n}\nor the\nLuxemburg-\nNakano\nnorm\n:\nâ£\nâ£\nx\nâ£\nâ£\nÏ\n|| x ||_{\\phi}\nâ£\nâ£\nx\nâ£\nâ£\nÏ\nâ\n= inf\n{\nÎ»\n>\n0\n:\nâ«\nÎ©\nÏ\n(\nâ£\nx\n(\nt\n)\nâ£\n/\nÎ»\n)\nd\nÎ¼\n(\nt\n)\nâ¤\n1\n}\n\\{\\lambda > 0 : \\int _{\\Omega } \\phi(|x(t)|/\\lambda)d\\mu(t) â¤ 1 \\}\n{\nÎ»\n>\n0\n:\nâ«\nÎ©\nâ\nÏ\n(\nâ£\nx\n(\nt\n)\nâ£\n/\nÎ»\n)\nd\nÎ¼\n(\nt\n)\nâ¤\n1\n}\nOrlicz spaces\nL\nÏ\nL^{\\phi}\nL\nÏ\nare a natural generalization of\nL\np\nL^{p}\nL\np\nspaces. They have very rich topological and geometrical structure; they may possess peculiar properties that do not occur in ordinary\nL\np\nL^{p}\nL\np\nspaces.\nOrlicz's ideas have inspired the research of many mathematicians. In recent decades those spaces have been used in analysis, constructive theory of functions, differential equations, integral equations,\nprobability\n, mathematical statistics, etc.\n(\ncf. monographs on Orlicz spaces: M A Krasnoselskii and Ya B Rutickii,\nConvex Functions and Orlicz Spaces\n(\nGroningen\n1961)\n,\nJ Lindenstrauss\nand L Tzafriri,\nClassical Banach Spaces\nI, II\n(\nSpringer\n1977\n,\n1979)\n, C Wu and T Wang,\nOrlicz Spaces and their Applications\n,\n(\nHarbin\n1983\n- Chinese\n)\n, A C Zaanen,\nRiesz Spaces\nII,\n(\nNorth-Holland\n1983)\n, C Wu, T Wang, S Chen and Y Wang,\nTheory of Geometry of Orlicz Spaces\n(\nHarbin\n1986\n- Chinese\n)\n, L Maligranda,\nOrlicz Spaces and Interpolation\n,\n(\nCampinas\n1989)\n, M M Rao and Z D Ren,\nTheory of Orlicz Spaces\n(\nMarcel Dekker\n1991)\nand S Chen,\nGeometry of Orlicz Spaces\n(\nDissertationes Math.\n356\n,\n1996)\n.\nThe term\nOrlicz spaces\nappeared in the sixties in the Mathematics Subject Classification index of the\nAmerican Mathematical Society\nin Section\n4635\n, which is now\n46\nE\n30\n,\nSpaces of measurable functions\n(\nL\np\n-spaces, Orlicz spaces, etc.\n)\n.\nTo emphasize the importance of Orlicz spaces in a jocular way, Professor Orlicz used to say that when he was occasionally asked:-\nWhy are Orlicz spaces \"better\" than L\np\nspaces?\nhe liked to answer:-\nTell me first why\nL\np\nL^{p}\nL\np\nspaces are \"better\" than\nL\n2\nL^{2}\nL\n2\n?\nHere is another anecdote in connection with Orlicz spaces:\nProfessor Orlicz had a small apartment and he once applied to the city administration for a bigger one. The answer of an employee was:-\nYour apartment is really small but we cannot accept your claim since we know that you have your own spaces !\nOrlicz's name is associated not only with the Orlicz spaces but also with the Orlicz-Pettis theorem, Orlicz property, Orlicz theorem on unconditional convergence in\nL\np\nL^{p}\nL\np\n,\nMazur\n-Orlicz bounded consistency theorem,\nMazur\n-Orlicz theorem on inequalities,\nMazur\n-Orlicz theorem on uniform boundedness in\nF\nF\nF\n-spaces, Orlicz category theorem, Orlicz interpolation theorem, Orlicz norm, Orlicz function, convexity in the sense of Orlicz,\nF\nF\nF\n-norm of\nMazur\n-Orlicz, Drewnowski-Orlicz theorem on representation of orthogonal additive functionals and modulars, Orlicz theorem on\nWeyl\nmultipliers, Matuszewska-Orlicz indices,\nHardy\n-Orlicz spaces,\nMarcinkiewicz\n-Orlicz spaces, Musielak-Orlicz spaces, Orlicz-\nSobolev\nspaces and Orlicz-\nBochner\nspaces.\nFor example, the Orlicz-Pettis theorem says that in Banach spaces the classes of weakly subseries convergent and norm unconditionally convergent series coincide.\nThe Orlicz theorem on unconditional convergence in\nL\np\nL^{p}\nL\np\nis:\nIf\n1\nâ¤\np\n<\nâ\n1 â¤ p < â\n1\nâ¤\np\n<\nâ\nand\nâ\nf\nn\n\\sum  f_{n}\nâ\nf\nn\nâ\nis unconditionally convergent in\nL\np\nL^{p}\nL\np\n, then\nâ\nâ£\nâ£\nf\nn\nâ£\nâ£\nm\na\nx\n(\np\n,\n2\n)\n<\nâ\n\\sum  || f_{n} || ^{max(p,2)} <  â\nâ\nâ£\nâ£\nf\nn\nâ\nâ£\nâ£\nm\na\nx\n(\np\n,\n2\n)\n<\nâ\n.\nIn\n1988\n, on the occasion of Orlicz's\n85\n-th birthday, Polish Scientific Publishers\n(\nPWN\n)\npublished his\nCollected Papers\n[\n3\n]\nin two volumes with a total of\n1754\npages, reproducing\n141\nhis articles from\n1926\n-\n1985\n.\nKuratowski\n[1\n, p.\n40]\nhas written about creation of the Polish School of Mathematics stating that:-\n...functional analysis owes its magnificient development to\nBanach\nand his students, especially to\nMazur\n, Orlicz and\nSchauder\n.\nOrlicz's scientific achievements are presented in detail in the papers by Maligranda-Matuszewska\n[\n7\n]\n, Maligranda-Wnuk\n[\n11\n]\nand Maligranda\n[\n6\n]\n. Paper\n[\n11\n]\ncontains a complete list of Orlicz's publications\n(171\npapers and\n3\nbooks\n)\n.\nIn the late seventies Orlicz started to collect information about mathematicians from LwÃ³w and he was planning to write a book on the\nHistory of the LwÃ³w School of Mathematics\n(\nhe published only two articles:\nThe LwÃ³w School of Mathematics between the Wars\n, Wiadom.
