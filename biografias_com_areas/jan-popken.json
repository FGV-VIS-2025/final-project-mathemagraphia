  "biografia": "Jan Popken\n's parents were Jan Popken\n(1868\n-\n1954)\n, son of Pieter Popken and Annis Boerhof, and Jantje Hofman\n(1873\n-\n1946)\n, daughter of Jan Hofman and Janna Haveman. Jan, the subject of this biography, had three siblings Annis Popken, Willem Popken and Pieter Popken. We have given his birthplace as Hijkersmilde near Smilde which was the situation when he was born but we note that Hijkersmilde is now a district of Smilde. The family were well off with Jan Popken Sr. having a thriving farm. He was also a threshing entrepreneur and, at the height of his business, had two threshing machines at his disposal and a hundred workers.\nAfter attending secondary school, Popken was able to study mathematics and physics at the University of Groningen since his parents were well off and able to support their son financially through university. Popken was taught by Johan Antony Barrau\n(1873\n-\n1953)\nwho had been advised by\nDiederik Korteweg\nfor his doctorate. Barrau had taught at the University of Delft before being appointed professor of synthetic, analytical and descriptive differential geometry at Groningen in\n1913\n. Another of Popken's teachers, who arrived in Groningen in\n1923\n, was the number theorist Johannes Gaultherus van der Corput\n(1890\n-\n1975)\n. Popken graduated with a candidate's degree\n(\nthe candidate's degree in the Netherlands is a first degree of the standard of a B.Sc.\n)\non\n15\nFebruary\n1927\n. Popken continued to study at Groningen, undertaking research, and obtained a second degree cum laude on\n2\nJuly\n1930\n. He had already some papers published in both French and German, namely\nSur la nature arithmÃ©tique du nombre e\nâ\n(\nSur la nature arithmetic du nombre e\n)\n(1928)\nand\nZur Transzendenz von e\nâ\n(\nOn the Transcendence of e\n)\n(1929)\n.\nLet us try to explain the problem on which Popken was undertaking research. A number\nk\nk\nk\nis\nalgebraic\nif, for some polynomial\nf\n(\nx\n)\nf(x)\nf\n(\nx\n)\nwith integer coefficients, not all zero,\nf\n(\nk\n)\n=\n0\nf(k) = 0\nf\n(\nk\n)\n=\n0\n. If\nk\nk\nk\nis not algebraic then it is called\ntranscendental\nso, in that case\nf\n(\nk\n)\nâ\n0\nf(k) â  0\nf\n(\nk\n)\nî\nâ\n=\n0\nfor every such polynomial\nf\nf\nf\n.\nLiouville\nshowed the existence of transcendental numbers in\n1844\nand constructed such numbers. The first number, not specially constructed to have this property, which was shown to be transcendental was\ne\ne\ne\nby\nHermite\nin\n1873\n. Now define the\nheight\nH\nH\nH\nof a polynomial to be the sum of the absolute values of its coefficients. For a given\nn\nn\nn\nand\nH\nH\nH\nthere are only finitely many polynomials\nf\nf\nf\nwith degree â¤\nn\nn\nn\nand height â¤\nH\nH\nH\n. If\nk\nk\nk\nis transcendental, then for a given\nn\nn\nn\nand\nH\nH\nH\nthere must exist\nC\nC\nC\nsuch that\nâ£\nf\n(\nk\n)\nâ£\n>\nC\n|f(k)| > C\nâ£\nf\n(\nk\n)\nâ£\n>\nC\nfor every\nf\nf\nf\nof degree â¤\nn\nn\nn\nand height â¤\nH\n.\nC\n(\nn\n,\nH\n)\nH. C(n, H)\nH\n.\nC\n(\nn\n,\nH\n)\nis called the\ntranscendental measure\nof\nk\nk\nk\n. The problem of finding the transcendental measure of e was posed by\nÃmile Borel\nin\n1899\nand, in\n1928\n, soon after he had completed his first degree, Popken read\nBorel\n's paper and decided to try to improve the bound for the transcendental measure of e. That is precisely what he did in the\n1929\npaper we mentioned above.\nAfter graduating in July\n1930\n, Popken spent two semesters at the University of GÃ¶ttingen with the number theorist\nEdmund Landau\n. The result of the expertise that Popken gained from\nEdmund Landau\nwas seen in his joint paper with Jurjen Koksma,\nZur Transzendenz von e\nÏ\nâ\n(\nOn the Transcendence of e\nÏ\n)\nwhich was published by\nCrelle\n's Journal in\n1932\n. In this paper the authors gave a transcendental measure for\ne\nÏ\ne^{\\pi}\ne\nÏ\n. After the study trip to GÃ¶ttingen, Popken returned, for financial reasons back to his birthplace Smilde. These were difficult times, even for such a gifted young mathematician, and jobs were scarce. Withdrawn to his parents' home, he wrote his thesis\nÃber arithmetische Eigenschaften analytischer Funktionen\nâ\n(\nAbout Arithmetic Properties of Analytical Functions\n)\nwhich earned him a doctorate from the University of Groningen on\n12\nJuly\n1935\n. His thesis advisor was Johannes van der Corput who wrote the following about Popken's thesis in\n[\n4\n]\n(\nwe give a full quote\n)\n:-\nIn my opinion, this dissertation is one of the best in mathematics to have appeared in the Netherlands in this century. If, after exactly\n36\nyears, I read it again, and delve into the subject again, I am struck not only by the results achieved and by the deep reasoning used, reasoning different from that usually used in the rest of mathematics, but also by the graceful form in which he has cast his work. Although many eminent mathematicians had devoted their energies to this difficult area, only a few general propositions were known, while it was the intention of the author to derive a number of comprehensive propositions. To this end, he divides his thesis consisting of\n121\npages into six parts. In the introduction, he discusses the old results obtained by others and the new ones from the author himself. Five parts follow. Parts I and II are devoted to the solutions of Hurwitz differential equations; part III deals with algebraic functions, part IV with functions that satisfy algebraic equations and finally part V with certain functions that he calls elementary.\nThe dissertation is written in the well-known\nEdmund Landau\nstyle, nowhere a word too much, but nowhere a word too little. With regard to the propositions, people sometimes wonder what the point of a particular proposition is, but nowhere is there given any information on this, because that connection appears later in the proof of a major proposition where the earlier proposition is applied. In an oral presentation, when dealing with such an assertion, it will as a rule be indicated with a few vague words how it fits into the direction of the requested theorem, but that indication does not fit into the aforementioned style, where no vagueness is allowed.\nIn Popken's dissertation there are fifteen major propositions with almost twice as many, most elaborate, minor propositions, which, all artfully and ingeniously combined, yield exactly the intended results. Many mathematics practitioners can read the dissertation without difficulty, because the entire argument is divided into so many small steps that each result follows from a single carefully worded statement. But a reading, step by step, takes weeks and even though the reader can then guarantee the correctness of the results achieved, he does not yet oversee the series of thoughts that led the author when writing the work.\nVan der Corput felt that Popken never received the credit that he deserved for this remarkable piece of work\n[\n4\n]\n:-\nThe period after his dissertation until the end of World War II was bleak for this scholar. His dissertation, however important, was actually read, understood and appreciated by only a few in the Netherlands. After all, mathematicians do not easily have the opportunity to take a period of one month away from the time available to them, solely for the purpose of studying a piece of writing that is outside of their interest. I have the impression that he has received a shock during that period, of which he never fully recovered, but he never spoke about it.\nFrom\n1937\nto\n1945\nhe worked as a teacher in The Hague, Veendam, and in Ter Apel. In\n1937\nPopken\nhabilitated\nat the University of Groningen with the thesis\nOver het rekenkundig karakter van getalen\nâ\n(\nOn the arithmetic character of numbers\n)\n. On\n3\nMay\n1937\nhe gave his public inaugural lecture entitled\nOver het rekenkundig karakter van getallen\nâ\n(\nOn the arithmetic character of numbers\n)\n. He remained a\ndocent\nat the University of Groningen until\n1940\n. The situation in the Netherlands changed dramatically in May\n1940\n. From the start of World War II in September\n1939\nthe Netherlands had declared itself neutral but on\n10\nMay\n1940\nGerman troops invaded the country. Popken left Groningen and moved to the University of Leiden where he was appointed as a docent in\n1940\n. The students, however, called for a strike after the Dean of the Faculty of Law made a protest speech on\n29\nNovember\n1940\n. The German occupiers closed the university but students were allowed to remain until they had taken their examinations in November\n1941\n. At this stage the Germans attempted to Nazify the university but most of the professors resigned in protest. Popken was still able to work as a school teacher but he had no university position until\n1945\nwhen the war ended.\nAfter the war Popken was appointed as a scientific assistant at the University of Groningen, a position he held from\n1945\nto\n1947\n. The war had caused a gap in Popken's publication record which had been an average of around two papers a year up to\n1940\n. The war, however, forced a gap in the record with no papers appearing between\n1941\nand\n1944\n. He was appointed to the Mathematical Centre in Amsterdam in\n1947\nbut later the same year he was appointed as a professor at the University of Utrecht. He delivered his inaugural lecture\nDe jeugdperikelen van het getal\nâ\n(\nThe youth pericles of the number\n)\non\n20\nOctober\n1947\n.\nWe give an English version of Popken's lecture on the primitive peoples' difficulties with numbers at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nPopken had married in Groningen on\n9\nAugust\n1947\nto Catharina Cornelia Johanna ten Cate, the stepdaughter of van der Corput. Three children were born from that marriage, Jeannette Popken, born in Utrecht on\n19\nMay\n1948\n, Peter Popken, born in Utrecht on\n30\nNovember\n1949\n, and Marion Popken, born in Utrecht on\n15\nDecember\n1952\n.\nOn\n19\nAugust\n1950\nPopken arrived in New York having sailed on the\nVolendam\nfrom Rotterdam, Netherlands. He was on his way to the International Congress of Mathematicians held at Harvard University from\n30\nAugust\n30\nto\n6\nSeptember\n1950\n. He sailed back from New York to Rotterdam on the same ship, the\nVolendam\n, leaving on\n18\nSeptember. In October\n1950\nthe Board of the Koninklijke Wiskundig Genootschap\n(\nDutch Mathematical Society\n)\nappointed a small committee with the task of drawing up a report on the structure and regulations for the International Congress of Mathematicians to be held in Amsterdam in\n1954\n.\nH D Kloosterman\nwas chair of this committee with\nHaantjes\nas its secretary and Popken as one of the three other members.\nPopken held the position as professor at the University of Utrecht for eight years before moving to Amsterdam when he was appointed as Professor of analysis, algebra and number theory at the university there on\n19\nJanuary\n1955\n. He gave his inaugural lecture,\nMathesis en maatschappij\nâ\n(\nMathesis and Society\n)\n, on\n11\nMarch\n1957\n. J H Wansink writes\n[\n5\n]\n:-\nThe danger is not inconceivable that mathematical lectures are difficult to digest for some listeners due to their technical nature and are therefore only slightly appreciated by these listeners. The Amsterdam inaugural lecture of Prof dr Popken, also addresses the non-mathematicians in his audience in a richly documented argument. The work of the mathematician is to discover new paths in mathematics, paths that are sometimes decisive for the course of humanity, even though the mathematician may have been far ahead of his time. This statement is illustrated by compelling examples. The inaugural lecture also sketches how the tragic isolation and unpopularity of mathematics grew especially in the\n19\nth century, at a time when many influential outsiders often identified mathematics with totally petrified school mathematics. A turn comes in the twentieth century; an understanding arises for the meaning of mathematics in philosophy. In the second industrial revolution we now live in, enthusiastic and successful searches are being made for new ways to which mathematics can be applied. Nobody left this lecture uninformed.\nPopken spent the summer of\n1959\nat the University of California in Berkeley. While at Berkeley, from\n18\nJune to\n20\nJuly\n1959\n, Popken delivered the course 'Elementary mathematics for advanced students'. This course studied selected topics in elementary mathematics, with particular emphasis on their historical development. It was designed to be particularly useful for high school teachers of mathematics. He also gave the course 'Algebraic and transcendental numbers'. It covered irrational numbers, algebraic numbers, approximation of algebraic numbers by rationals,\nLiouville\nnumbers, the theorem of\nThue\n-\nSiegel\n-\nRoth\n, transcendence of e and Ï, the Lindemann theorem, and some recent results in the theory. Note that\nRoth\nin the\nThue\n-\nSiegel\n-\nRoth\ntheorem is\nKlaus Roth\n.\nOn\n31\nAugust\n1962\nPopken, his wife Catharina, and his three children Jeannette, Peter and Marion flew to New York. They gave their permanent address as Boslaan\n2\n, Amstelveen, Holland. We note that Amstelveen is about\n8\nkm to the south of Amsterdam. Popken was on his way the spend time at the University of California in Berkeley and gave their address in the United States as\n1597\nHawthorne Terrace, Berkeley. While in the United States, Popken participated in the\n1962\nconference 'Studies in mathematical analysis and related topics' held at Stanford University. He delivered the paper\nOn multiplicative arithmetic functions\nwhich was published in the proceedings of the conference.\nOn\n12\nApril\n1965\nPopken changed from the position of Professor of Analysis, algebra and number theory to being Professor of Pure Mathematics, still at the University of Amsterdam.\nIn the later stages of his career, Popken became increasingly interested in the history of mathematics. He continued, however, to publish papers on a variety of different topics. For example, after being appointed to the University of Amsterdam he published papers such as:\nSome theorems concerning transcendental numbers\n(1956)\n;\nArithmetical properties of the Taylor coefficients of algebraic functions\n(1959)\n;\nAlgebraic dependence of arithmetic functions\n(1962)\n;\nOn the so-called von Neumann numbers\n(1962)\n;\nIrrational power series\n(1963)\n;\nNote on a generalization of problem of Hilbert\n(1965)\n;\nAlgebraic independence of certain zeta functions\n(1966)\n;\nA measure for the differential-transcendence of the zeta-function of Riemann\n(1969)\n; and\nA contribution to the Thue-Siegel-Roth problem\n(1970)\n.\nThis publication record hides the fact that in the final years of his life he was suffering a tiring and painful illness. Despite the extremely difficult conditions, he continued to work up to his death at\n64\nyears of age.\nAmong the honours he received was election to the\nRoyal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences\nin\n1954\n.\nFinally, we note that at least seven of his Ph.D. students\n(\nsome while he served at Utrecht and some at Amsterdam\n)\nbecame university lecturers in mathematics and all these seven have in turn supervised Ph.D. students of their own. The most famous of these seven is, perhaps, is Abraham van der Sluis\n(1928\n-\n2004)\nwho graduated from the University of Amsterdam in\n1956\nwith his thesis\nGeneral Orthogonal Polynomals\nand went on to set up the computer centre at the University of Utrecht where he was director until\n1970\n.",
