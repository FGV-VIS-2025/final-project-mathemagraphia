  "biografia": "Giovanni Guccia\n's father was Giuseppe Maria Guccia and his mother was Chiara Cipponeri. Giovanni was born in Sicily into an important wealthy Sicilian family. His father was related to the Marquis of Ganzaria and no expense was spared to give Giovanni a good education. He was educated in Palermo where he not only learnt academic subjects, but he also became an expert horseman and excelled in sports in general.\nGuccia began his studies at the university in Palermo but he later undertook research under\nCremona\nin Rome. While a student at Rome, Guccia attended the French Association for the Advancement of Science which was held at Rheims. The paper he read at the meeting in Rheims was on certain rational surfaces and his presentation was highly praised by\nSylvester\n. This was encouragement indeed for the young mathematician beginning his research career.\nIn\n1880\nGuccia submitted his doctoral dissertation on a class of surfaces representable point by point on a plane to the University of Rome and after successfully defending his thesis he returned to his native town of Palermo. Appointed to the university there, he began to work out an ambitious research programme. In\n1884\nhe set up\nMathematical Circle of Palermo\nand, being from a wealthy family, he was able to provide all the necessary resources to have the project rapidly become successful. Speziali writes in that, for the new society, Guccia provided\n[\n1\n]\n:-\n... the meeting place, a library and all necessary funds. His generous offer was favourably received, and on\n2\nMarch\n1884\nthe society's provisional statutes were signed by twenty-seven members. The goal was to stimulate the study of higher mathematics by means of original communications presented by the members of the society on the different branches of analysis and geometry, as well as on rational mechanics, mathematical physics, geodesy, and astronomy.\nThe publication for the new society was the\nRendiconti del Circolo Matematico di Palermo\n. Guccia himself had four articles appear in the first volume of this publication, the first on\nCremona\ntransformations and a generalisation of a theorem due to\nHirst\n, while the second was on a generalisation of a theorem due to\nMax Noether\n. This first volume appeared in four parts: July\n1885\n, September\n1886\n, December\n1886\n, and September\n1887\n. The completed volume was presented by\nBertrand\nto the\nAcadÃ©mie des Sciences\nin Paris on\n7\nNovember\n1887\n, stating that it was a publication of remarkably high quality. When Guccia's society passed a statute allowing foreign members in February\n1888\n, it had rapidly reached its goal of becoming a top quality international society with a leading mathematical publication.\nIn\n1889\nGuccia was appointed to the chair of geometry at Palermo which he held for the rest of his life. He set up a mathematical publishing house in Palermo in\n1893\nadding further publications to the\nRendiconti del Circolo Matematico di Palermo\n. Guccia became editor of all these publications.\nAs we have indicated above, Guccia's work was on geometry, in particular\nCremona\ntransformations, classification of curves and projective properties of curves. His results published in volume one of the\nRendiconti del Circolo Matematico di Palermo\nwere extended by\nCorrado Segre\nin\n1888\nand\nCastelnuovo\nin\n1897\n. Speziali writes in\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nAlthough the majority of Guccia's publications are very short, they all contain original ideas and new relations profitably used by other geometers. This is particularly true of his publications on projective involutions, which laid the foundations for the generalisations of Federico\nEnriques\nand Francesco\nSeveri\n.",
