  "biografia": "Bob Thomason\nentered Michigan State University in\n1971\nto read for a mathematics degree. He graduated in\n1973\nand then went to Princeton University to study for his doctorate. His supervisor at Princeton was John Moore and he wrote a dissertation on category theory in which he produced results which were to become fundamental tools in\ntopology\n.\nAfter graduating with his doctorate in June\n1977\nThomason was appointed as Moore instructor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. This was a two year appointment and Thomason remained there until he took up a three year post as\nDickson\nassistant professor at the University of Chicago in\n1979\n.\nThings did not go smoothly for Thomason, however, at the University of Chicago. While working on conjectures of\nQuillen\n-Lichtenbaum connecting K-theory to Ãtale\ncohomology\nThomason produced what was first thought to be a remarkable proof. However, an error was found in\n1980\nand\n[\n4\n]\n:-\n... Thomason began to feel uncomfortable about the scepticism expressed by others. Perceiving this as persecution, he resigned from his position at Chicago in June\n1980\n.\nDuring the two years after Thomason resigned from Chicago he spent some time at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and one year at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton. This was a mathematically profitable time for him and he was able to complete the results that had gone wrong while he was at Chicago along with some other major pieces of work.\nThomason's next post was at Johns Hopkins University where he was appointed in\n1983\n. During the six years he spent there he produced a series of outstanding papers solving, among others, problems arising from\nGrothendieck\n's work in his paper with Berthelot and Illusie\nThÃ©orie des Intersections et ThÃ©orÃ¨me de Riemann-Roch\n(1971)\n. For example in a\n1983\npaper he found a partial solution of\nGrothendieck\n's absolute cohomological purity conjecture.\nDuring his time at Johns Hopkins University, Thomason was awarded a Sloan Fellowship which enabled him to spend the year\n1987\nat Rutgers University. Thomason spent three years working on the problems of\nGrothendieck\nreferred to above. In\n[\n4\n]\na most remarkable story is told regarding this work:-\nWhile at Rutgers, he put everything in place except for one step ... On January\n22\n1988\n, he had a dream in which his recently deceased friend Thomas Trobaugh told him how to solve the final step.... Awaking with a start, he worked out the argument for the missing step. In gratitude, he listed his friend as a coauthor of the resulting paper.\nThe importance of this work was recognised when Thomason was chosen to give an address at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Kyoto in\n1990\n.\nIn October\n1989\nThomason was appointed to a post in Max Karoubi's laboratory at the University of Paris VII. He continued to produce outstanding work, publishing six papers before his death in\n1995\n. He had health problems which were to lead to his death\n[\n4\n]\n:-\nBob had diabetes and always had to strictly control what he ate. This made going to restaurants with Bob an awkward affair, because he would not eat something until he was sure it had no nutritional content. Early in November\n1995\n[\nsome accounts say late October\n]\n, just before his\n43\nrd\nbirthday, he went into diabetic shock and died in has apartment in Paris.\nThomason first important results concerned a proof that all infinite loop space machines produce equivalent output. Working with J P May he wrote a paper\nThe uniqueness of infinite loop space machines\n. Quoting from the paper:-\nAn infinite loop space machine is a functor which constructs spectra out of ... space level data. There are many such machines known ...; they are given by such widely disparate topological constructions that it is far from obvious that they turn out equivalent spectra when fed the same data. The purpose of this paper is to prove that all machines which satisfy certain reasonable properties do in fact turn out equivalent spectra.\nThomason then developed material which he had studied for his doctorate considering the\nhomotopy theory\nof the category of small categories and the homotopy theory of the category of small symmetric monoidal categories.\nWe have already mentioned Thomason's results on the conjectures of\nQuillen\n-Lichtenbaum connecting K-theory to Ã©tale cohomology which he achieved during\n1980\n-\n83\n. A reviewer of his paper\nAlgebraic K-theory and Ã©tale cohomology\n(1985)\nwrote:-\nThis paper is one of the most important papers in algebraic K-theory since a paper by D\nQuillen\n... in\n1972\n. Versions of the paper have circulated in manuscript form for several years and it is good to see it appear finally. The paper is important both for the results proved, and for the techniques used. The author pushes the applications of stable homotopy and homotopical algebra to algebraic K-theory and\nalgebraic geometry\nfurther than anyone else and his methods have exerted considerable influence on other workers in the field.\nThomason's work during the next three years was on equivariant algebraic K-theory. He worked on the algebraic K-theory of algebraic group actions on schemes. He produced a theorem published in\n1988\nsaid to be:-\n... one of the most important and powerful tools in algebraic K-theory. It is also one of the most sought-after. Much work has been done in attempts to extend\nQuillen\n's localization theorem to more general contexts, but none has even begun to approach the complete generality achieved in this paper.\nA\n1990\nhe contributed a paper\n(\nthe one written after his dream with Thomas Trobaugh as coauthor\n)\nto\nThe Grothendieck Festschrift\nwhich is described as a 'landmark paper'.\nThomason solved a problem in\n1995\nwhich had been posed by\nGrothendieck\n. The problem concerned lifting a homotopy structure. He lectured on this result in Genova only about three weeks before his death. He never wrote these results up for publication.\nWeibel paints a picture of Thomason in\n[\n4\n]\n:-\nLike many of his colleagues, Bob Thomason hated to waste energy on trivial matters, like fashion. He made the decision early in life to dress only in black clothing, thus simplifying that portion of his life. With his pointed goatee, he looked like a beat poet to outsiders, but mathematicians knew him as one of the greatest talents of his generation. Few have had the simultaneous grasp of topology, algebraic geometry and K-theory that Thomason did.",
