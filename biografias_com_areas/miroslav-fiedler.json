  "biografia": "Miroslav Fiedler\nwas brought up in Prague where he attended school. His mathematical talents were clear by the time he was at secondary school and he showed these more widely by winning the mathematical problem solving competition in the journal\nRozhledy matematicko-prirodovedecke\n. After graduating from high school in\n1945\n, Fiedler entered the Charles University of Prague to study mathematics and physics. As an undergraduate, he was taught by Bohumil Bydzovsky\n(\nborn\n1880)\nwho had himself studied at the Charles University where he had been strongly influenced by his teacher and advisor\nEduard Weyr\n. Bydzovsky's interests were mainly in geometry and he passed this love to Fiedler whom he advised while he wrote his undergraduate thesis\nHyperosculating points of algebraic plane curves and their generalization in\nS\nr\nS_{r}\nS\nr\nâ\n. For this thesis, which contained generalizations of Bydzovsky's results, Fiedler was awarded the degree of RNDr\n(\nrerum naturalium doctor\n)\nin\n1950\n. This degree, although it is in some sense a doctorate, has a level more nearly equivalent to a Master's Degree.\nFollowing the award of the RNDr, Fiedler undertook research at the Central Institute of Mathematics in Prague. He became a member of the first group of postgraduate students organized by\nEduard Cech\nin the Central Institute of Mathematics. In\n[\n2\n]\n, Fiedler writes:-\nThis group\n(\nwhich included\nIvo Babuska\n,\nJaroslav HÃ¡jek\n, Jaroslav Kurzweil, Jan Marik, Vlastimil PtÃ¡k, FrantiÅ¡ek Sik, Otto Vejvoda, Milos ZlÃ¡mal and others\n)\nwould stimulate mathematical research in Czechoslovakia after a gap during the war.\nIn\n1948\na totalitarian government began to run Czechoslovakia and they closed down all the learned societies. In November\n1952\nthe\nCzechoslovak Academy of Sciences\nwas founded which served both a learned society and also as an organisation to run all the research institutes which were incorporated into it. At this time the Central Institute of Mathematics in which Fiedler was undertaking research became part of the\nCzechoslovak Academy of Sciences\n. In\n1953\nthe Czechoslovak government brought a degree structure into the education system essentially the same as that in the USSR, so in particular the degree CSc.\n(\nCandidate of Science, essentially equivalent to a Ph.D. in standard\n)\nwas introduced. The degree could be awarded by the\nCzechoslovak Academy of Sciences\n. Fiedler was already undertaking research supervised by\nEduard Cech\nwhen the new degree was introduced and he became one of the first to be awarded the degree in\n1955\nfor his thesis\nGeometry of the simplex\n. He published his thesis in three parts\n(1954\n,\n1955\n,\n1956)\nbut these were not his first publications, having already published\nSolution of a problem of Professor E Cech\n(1952)\n,\nOn certain matrices and the equation for the parameters of singular points of a rational curve\n(1952)\n, and\n(\nwith L GranÃ¡t\n)\nRational curve with the maximum number of real nodal points\n(1954)\n. Note that we give these titles in English although they were in Czech; we do the same for other titles below.\nOver the next few years Fiedler's research activities were remarkable not only for the depth of the results he achieved but also for the diverse areas of mathematics in which he worked. As well as geometry, he began to study numerical methods, matrix theory and graph theory. Examples of papers he published on these topics are:\nNumerical solution of algebraic equations which have roots with almost the same modulus\n(1956)\n;\nNumerical solution of algebraic equations by the Bernoulli-Whittaker method\n(1957)\n;\nOn some properties of Hermitian matrices\n(1957)\n;\n(\nwith Jiri SedlÃ¡cek\n)\nOn W-bases of directed graphs\n(1958)\n; and\n(\nwith Josej Bily and FrantiÅ¡ek Nozieka\n)\nDie Graphentheorie in Anwendung auf das Transportproblem\nâ\n(\nThe application of graph theory to a transportation problem\n)\n(1958)\n. In\n1963\nhe was awarded the degree DrSc\n(\nDoctor of Sciences\n)\n, the highest possible degree essentially equivalent to the\nhabilitation\nin level, following a defence of his thesis. Two years later, in\n1965\n, he was appointed as a full professor of mathematics in the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics of the Charles University of Prague. In\n[\n1\n]\nthe following appreciation of his contributions is given:-\nSince the early days of his research career, his favourite subjects have been geometry, graph theory, linear algebra, and their applications to numerical computations. Through\n2006\n, he has authored or co-authored six books\n(\ntwo of which have been published in English\n)\nand close to\n200\nof papers in these and related fields\n(\na bibliography is attached\n)\n. Some of his results have shaped entire research areas, and his work has deeply influenced scientific computing in general. For many years he lectured at universities throughout the former Czechoslovakia. He always cared about talented students on the high school level - for\n50\nyears he has been a leading figure in organizing mathematical competitions including the Mathematical Olympiad.\nFiedler's impressive contributions soon gained him an international reputation and he was given invitations to lecture at many conferences and also to make longer research visits to several universities. He spent six months as a Visiting Research Mathematician at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, USA, in\n1964\n, he spent the academic year\n1969\n-\n70\nas a Visiting Professor at Auburn University at Auburn, Alabama, USA, returning there ten years later for a six months research visit in\n1979\n-\n1980\n. He was also a Visiting Professor at the University of South Carolina on two separate occasions spending over four months there in\n1984\nand again in\n1987\n.\nThe above quoted appreciation mentions Fiedler's six books. The first of these books were\n(\nwith Karel Culik and Vaclav Dolezal\n)\nCombinatorial Analysis in Practice\n(1967)\n, and\n(\nwith Jaroslav Zemanek\n)\nSelected Problems of the Mathematical Olympiads\n(1976)\n. Next we mention\nSpecial matrices and their applications in numerical mathematics\npublished in Czech in\n1981\n. An updated English translation appeared in\n1986\n, with a second edition appearing in\n2008\n. Fiedler writes in the Preface:-\nIn developing this book, the author has considered special matrices in the general sense and also included some more or less auxiliary topics that made it possible to present some facts or processes more demonstratively. An example is the graph theory.\nIn\n2001\nhe published a book which mentions three of the topics which made up his special interest in its title:\nMatrices and graphs in Euclidean geometry\n(2001)\n. Many of Fiedler's results published over the years\n1985\n-\n2000\nwere collected together in the book\nLinear optimization problems with inexact data\n(2006)\nwhich he co-authored with Josef Nedoma, Jaroslav Ramik, Jiri Rohn and Karel Zimmermann. The authors aimed their monograph at those interested in optimization, operations research, linear algebra and fuzzy sets.\nFiedler has received many honours for his contributions. In particular he received the Hans Schneider Prize from the International Linear Algebra Society:-\n... for research, contributions, and achievements at the highest level of Linear Algebra.\nThe Prize was awarded in March\n1993\nat a meeting in Pensacola, Florida, USA and, at the same meeting,\nIsrael Gohberg\nand Shmuel Friedland received the Prize. They became the first three winners of this award. Fiedler has also been awarded, jointly with Vlastimil PtÃ¡k, the National Prize of the Czech Republic in\n1978\n. In\n[\n2\n]\nFiedler writes about the joint work he undertook with his long-time colleague PtÃ¡k:-\nI should mention our results on M-matrices and P-matrices, on the theory of norms and applications in iterative processes, later on linear operators on polyhedral cones, on structured matrices\n(\nHankel\n,\nBÃ©zout\nand\nLoewner\n)\nand on some inequalities. We published\n25\njoint papers. I always enjoyed to work with Mila\n[\nthe name by which Vlastimil PtÃ¡k was known to his friends\n]\nand gave top priority to such work. Maybe our approaches to problems were partly complementary. Mila sought more for a theoretical point of view while I was closer to technical considerations.\nFiedler was elected an honorary member of the\nUnion of Czechoslovak Mathematicians and Physicists\nin\n1985\n, received the\nBernard Bolzano\nGold Medal from the\nCzechoslovak Academy of Sciences\nin\n1986\n, and the De Scientia et Humanitate Optime Meritis of the\nAcademy of Sciences of the Czech Republic\nin\n2006\n, this being the highest medal of the Academy.",
