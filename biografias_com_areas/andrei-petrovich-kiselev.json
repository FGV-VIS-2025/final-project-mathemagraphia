  "biografia": "Andrei Petrovich Kiselev\n's name is sometimes transliterated as\nKiselyov\n. His father Petr Kiselev was born around\n1815\nand his mother Anna N was born around\n1818\n. It was a family of merchants who were quite poor. Andrei was the youngest of his parents' six children having older siblings Nicholas\n(\nborn about\n1838)\n, Pelagia\n(\nborn about\n1848)\n, Petr\n(\nborn about\n1848)\n, Mari\n(\nborn about\n1850)\n, and Alexandr\n(\nborn about\n1851)\n. Kiselev attended the district school in Mtsensk and from there he went to the\nGymnasium\nin Oryol, the main city in the region. There is no way that Kiselev's family could have afforded to give him this high quality school education but he was able to attend these school partly through the generosity of merchant friends who helped support him and partly through scholarships he was awarded by the schools because of his outstanding performance. It is worth recording at this point that at least two of the mathematics teachers who taught Kiselev during his school years taught from textbooks that they had written themselves. Perhaps this influenced Kiselev to become a writer of textbooks when he himself became a school teacher. He graduated from this Gymnasium in\n1871\nhaving won the gold medal and, in the same year, entered the Physics and Mathematics Faculty of St Petersburg University.\nAt St Petersburg University, Kiselev was taught by a number of world-class mathematicians. He attended lectures by\nPafnuty Lvovich Chebyshev\n,\nAleksandr Nikolaevich Korkin\n,\nEgor Ivanovich Zolotarev\n,\nOsip Ivanovich Somov\nand others. In\n1874\n, while an undergraduate, he married Mari Edwardovna Schultz; they had three children. Their son Vladimir graduated from St Petersburg State University and then joined the Navy, their daughter Elena began training to become a mathematics teacher but was forced to give up because of illness, and their other daughter graduated from the St Petersburg Women's Medical Institute. Kiselev graduated in\n1875\nfrom the Physics and Mathematics Faculty of St Petersburg University with a degree which entitled him to teach in Gymnasia. After graduating, he taught mathematics, mechanics and drawing at the 'real school' in Voronezh which had recently opened. A real school, which followed the German model, trained people to enter technical higher education while a Gymnasium trained people to enter the university system. Despite the Gymnasium being the higher quality institution, nevertheless the real schools on the whole taught their pupils more mathematics.\nKiselev taught at the 'real school' in Voronezh until July\n1891\nwhen he spent a year teaching at a Gymnasium in Kursk before returning to Voronezh to teach at the Voronezh cadet corps. This was not the first time he had taught there for during his years teaching at the real school he had also done some part-time teaching at the cadet corps. He continued to teach at the Voronezh cadet corps until he retired in\n1901\n. He ended up a rich man because of his textbooks which became classics and were used in Russia for a great many years. Let us now list these texts.\nHere are the most important of Kiselev's textbooks:\nSystematic arithmetic course for secondary schools\n(1884)\n;\nElementary Algebra\n(1888)\n;\nElementary Geometry\n(1892\n-\n1893)\n;\nAdditional topics in algebra\n(\na course of the\n7\nth\ngrade real schools\n)\n(1893)\n;\nQuick arithmetic for urban schools\n(1895)\n;\nA Brief algebra for girls' schools and seminaries\n(1896)\n;\nAn elementary physics for secondary schools with a number of exercises and problems\n(1902)\n;\nPhysics\n(\ntwo volumes\n)\n(1908)\n;\nElements of the differential and integral calculus\n(1908)\n;\nThe initial study of derivatives for the\n7\nth\ngrade real schools\n(1911)\n;\nGraphical representation of some of the features discussed in elementary algebra\n(1911)\n;\nOn topics in elementary geometry, which are usually solved by means of limits\n(1916)\n;\nBrief algebra\n(1917)\n;\nBrief arithmetic for urban county schools\n(1918)\n;\nIrrational numbers, considered as infinite non-periodic fractions\n(1923)\n; and\nElements of algebra and analysis\n(2\nvolumes\n)\n(1930\n-\n1931)\n.\nIt was the first three of these books which were the main school mathematics texts in Russia for many years. Many of the other books were simply adaptations of these three to different types of educational establishments. However, books on other subjects such as\nPhysics,\nwhich went through\n13\neditions, and\nElements of the differential and integral calculus\nwhich also went through multiple editions were also popular but never came near to matching the incredible popularity of\nSystematic arithmetic course for secondary schools\n,\nElementary Algebra\nand\nElementary Geometry\n. The following gives a good indication of the sales of these books\n[\n7\n]\n:-\nA surviving notebook of Kiselev's indicates that, for example, in\n1915\nalone his earnings from 'Arithmetic' and 'Algebra' were ten times greater than his annual pension\n(\nwhich was, it should be noted, almost a general's pension\n)\n.\nA review of\nElementary Geometry\nwritten in\n1893\n, the year after the book was published, states quite correctly that it was:-\n... structured in accordance with the views on the exposition of this subject that have been expressed by the authors of the latest French and German handbooks, particularly the former.\nThis was clearly the case for, in the Preface to the first edition of this book, Kiselev quotes ten geometry courses in French and German published in the previous decade. What made these books so successful? Here is the reasons given by a Russian educator in\n1941\n[\n7\n]\n:-\nKiselev's textbooks came out on top because they were exemplars of a teacher's common sense and experience. The well-known Russian mathematics educator Ivan Andronov\n(1941)\nonce wrote that Kiselev knew his strengths and did not undertake that for which his strengths might not have been sufficient. Kiselev's textbooks are well-organized and logical\n(\nlater, they were found to contain not a few logical gaps, but all of these were beyond the understanding of the ordinary student\n)\n. In the course in geometry - Kiselev's most popular course - practically all of the assertions are grounded and proved. But Kiselev never tried to offer a strict axiomatic course with complete indication of axioms and all of the references that a professional mathematician would have considered necessary.\nThere were other reasons too which were not related to the quality of the texts but rather to Kiselev's skills as a salesman. He sent free copies of his books to teachers and to the offices of journals where he hoped a review might appear. These selling techniques are common today but in Kiselev's time these were new ways of selling books and they certainly added to the success of the books. However, success ultimately depends on having outstanding books and Kiselev seems to have produced books with just the right approach. Kiselev himself suggested that the properties required of a good textbook were precision, simplicity, and conciseness.\nWhen the Russian Revolution took place in\n1917\nit looked at first as if Kiselev's good life, living off a good pension and royalties, would be over. He had retired in\n1901\nand after a while had moved to St Petersburg to be near his publishers. However, the city was badly affected by the Revolution and the civil war that followed. With food scarce and his pension and income from books taken away, Kiselev returned to Voronezh where he took up teaching again in the colleges there. Kiselev's books became irrelevant to the Communist ideas of education in the years following the Revolution where all textbooks were considered unnecessary. However, many teachers ignored the new ideas and continued to use Kiselev's books. Slowly they returned to full use after the\nMoscow Mathematical Society\n, at a meeting held on\n9\nApril\n1937\n, recommended that Kiselev's\nGeometry\nshould be, for the time being, the book used by schools. By the\n1950\ns the book was still in widespread use and most Russian mathematicians who were at school in the early\n1960\ns said that they had used Kiselev's books.\nWe give an idea of the style of Kiselev's\nGeometry\nby quoting from Alex Bogomolny's review of\nPlanimetry\n[\n4\n]\n:-\nThe most shining example is Kiselev's treatment of the circumference and Ï. Circumference is defined as the limit of the perimeters of regular polygons inscribed into the circle when the number of sides is doubled indefinitely. Doesn't that sound impressive? But consider then that Kiselev precedes the definition with a reasonably developed theory of limits. The book gives a very clear introduction into the theory of limits which, although not\n100\n% rigorous, neither noticeably cuts corners. For example, the book does prove that the limit\n(\nwhich is the circumference\n)\nexists. This comes after a thorough discussion of similarity. In particular, he proves that regular polygons with the same number of sides are similar, and their sides have the same ratio as their radii. Combining this with the theory of limits he derives the fact that the ratio of the circumference to the diameter is the same for all circles and thus introduces Ï.\nHere is another example of Kiselev's style, this time from Alex Bogomolny's review of\nStereometry\n[\n5\n]\n:-\nOn the whole, the economy of presentation is nothing short of remarkable. Just to take one example:\nCavalieri\n's Principle. Kiselev rightly observes that to justify it one needs methods that would go beyond elementary mathematics. However, the principle is elegant and useful and mentioning it supplies an engaging historical background along with a viable demonstration of the continuity of the evolution of mathematics over time. So, based on the theory of limits developed in the first part\n(\nPlanimetry\n)\n, Kiselev proves\n(\nalthough without ever employing the symbol lim\n)\nthe principle for triangular pyramids and uses the occasion to mention\nHilbert\n's third problem. Later on, he applies the principle to determine the volume of a ball\n(\nbut now without proof\n)\nand makes use of the opportunity to mention the work of\nArchimedes\nand of the recovery of his tomb by Cicero.\nHe was able to return to St Petersburg, by then known as Leningrad, towards the end of his life. It was around this time that Kiselev said:-\nI am happy that I lived to see the days when mathematics became the property of the broad masses. Is it possible to compare the meagre circulation of pre-revolutionary times to the present. And it's not surprising. After all, the whole country is now studying. I am glad that in my old age I can be useful to their great motherland.\nWe should say a little about two further aspects of Kiselev's life, namely his ideas as a teacher and his involvement in politics. We know a little about his ideas on teaching through a report he wrote in\n1907\n. We quote from\n[\n7\n]\n:-\nAt that time, the liberally-minded public took a decisive stand against examinations as a practice that constrained students, engendered a regime of rigid control, and so on. Kiselev spoke about the various \"aberrations\" in the schools: the fact that classes were overcrowded, the fact that there was not enough time properly to interview and assess all of the students in a class, the fact that school schedules were poorly designed, as a result of which there were \"empty\" lessons at the end of the year, which students spent playing games. He spoke about the importance of independent work and examinations as a means of instigating students to engage in such work, and he pointed out that an examination is often the teacher's only opportunity thoroughly to evaluate the students. He concluded his report, however, not by urging that examinations be preserved, but merely by recommending that no support be given to petitions for their elimination, leaving the decision to others.\nRather than give details of his political career, suffice to say that for many years he sat on the Voronezh city council. He also served on the boards of many educational institutions. In the time before the Revolution, he stood for the Russian National Duma on a fairly right-wing policy. He argued that the most pressing problem was agriculture. He did not agree with policies to take land away from the landowners but argued that peasants should be settled on unoccupied lands. He was not elected to the Russian National Duma but continued to play a big role in local Voronezh politics.\nHe has been honoured in a number of ways. During his lifetime Kiselev was awarded the Order of St Anne\n3\nrd\ndegree\n(1894)\n, the Order of St Stanislaus\n2\nnd\ndegree\n(1896)\n, the Order of St Anne\n2\nnd\ndegree\n(1899)\n, and the Order of the Red Banner of Labour\n(1934)\n. After his death more honours were given to him: in his native town of Mtsensk the Gymnasium No\n3\nhas been named after him; also in Voronezh there is a school named after him; and the building which houses the history department of Oryol State University is named after him.\nHe taught several pupils who went on to have top careers as mathematicians. For example\nSergei Alekseevich Chaplygin\nwas taught in Voronezh by Kiselev. A great many others, such as\nIossif Vladimirovich Ostrovskii\n, were turned on to mathematics by reading Kiselev's books. But perhaps the greatest compliment of all was from\nVladimir Igorevich Arnold\n. When asked what textbook was best to use in schools, he replied, \"I would go back to Kiselev\".\nAfter his death in Leningrad, Kiselev was buried in the Volkov cemetery, in an area reserved for academics. His grave is next to that of the famous chemist Dmitry Ivanovich Mendeleev who produced the periodic table.",
