  "biografia": "Dusa McDuff\nwas christened Margaret Dusa Waddington. Her father, Conrad Hal Waddington, was appointed Professor of Genetics at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland while her mother, Margaret Justin Blanco White, was an architect who had a Civil Service post in Edinburgh. Dusa was educated at a girls school in Edinburgh and, although the standard was less good than at the boys school, nevertheless she had an exceptionally good mathematics teacher. She wrote:-\nI always wanted to be a mathematician\n(\napart from a time when I was eleven when I wanted to be a farmer's wife\n)\n, and assumed that I would have a career, but I had no idea how to go about it: I didn't realise that the choices which one made about education were important and I had no idea that I might experience real difficulties and conflicts in reconciling the demands of a career with life as a woman.\nBy the time that Dusa completed her secondary schooling in Edinburgh she had a boyfriend. This led to her choosing the University of Edinburgh for her undergraduate studies, turning down a scholarship which she had won to go to Cambridge University. During her undergraduate years at Edinburgh Dusa married her boyfriend and took his name becoming Dusa McDuff. Awarded a B.Sc. from Edinburgh in\n1967\n, Dusa went to Girton College, Cambridge for her doctoral studies.\nAt Cambridge McDuff was supervised by G A Reid and she worked on problems in\nfunctional analysis\n. This time her husband followed her to Cambridge. She solved a difficult problem on von Neumann algebras, constructing infinitely many different factors of type\nI\nI\n1\nII_{1}\nI\nI\n1\nâ\n, and published the work in the\nAnnals of Mathematics\n.\nAfter completing her doctorate in\n1971\nMcDuff was appointed to a two-year Science Research Council Postdoctoral Fellowship at Cambridge. Then McDuff followed her husband again, this time with a six month visit to Moscow. He was studying the Russian Symbolist poet Innokenty Annensky and Dusa had no specific plans, yet it would turn out a very profitable visit for her mathematically. She met\nIsrail Gelfand\nin Moscow and he gave her a deeper appreciation of mathematics. McDuff wrote:-\nGelfand\namazed me by talking of mathematics as though it were poetry. He once said about a long paper bristling with formulas that it contained the vague beginnings of an idea which he could only hint at and which he had never managed to bring out more clearly. I had always thought of mathematics as being much more straightforward: a formula is a formula, and an algebra is an algebra, but\nGelfand\nfound hedgehogs lurking in the rows of his spectral sequences!\nAfter the Moscow visit, where she studied\nGelfand\n-Fuchs\ncohomology\n, McDuff returned to Cambridge. There she attended\nFrank Adams\n's\ntopology\nlectures and around this time her first child was born. However her research at this time was not well focused and she began to lose her way a little. Appointed to a position as a lecturer at the University of York in\n1973\nshe began to work with Graeme Segal on classifying spaces of categories. To a certain extent she considered this as a second doctorate to regain direction for her research.\nPerhaps\n1974\nwas a turning point for McDuff. She was invited to spend a year at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She wrote:-\nThis was a turning point. While there I realised how far away I was from being the mathematician I felt that I could be, but also realised that I could do something about it. For the first time, I met some other women whom I could relate to and who also were trying to become mathematicians. I became much less passive: I applied to the Institute for Advanced Study and got in, and even had a mathematical idea again, which grew into a joint paper with Segal on the group-completion theorem.\nBack in England, McDuff separated from her husband and, soon afterwards, she was appointed to a post at the University of Warwick in\n1976\n. McDuff had a friend, the mathematician\nJack Milnor\nwho worked in Princeton. After two years at Warwick, McDuff resigned her tenured post there and accepted an untenured post at the State University of New York at Stony Brook so that she could be close to\nMilnor\n. McDuff wrote:-\nI still worked very much in isolation and there are only a few people who are interested in what I did, but it was a necessary apprenticeship. I had some ideas, and gained confidence in my technical abilities. Of course, I was influenced by the clarity of\nJack Milnor\n's ideas and approach to mathematics, and was helped by his encouragement. I kept my job in Stony Brook, even though it meant a long commute to Princeton and a weekend relationship, since it was very important to me not to compromise on my job as my mother had done. After several years, I married Jack and had a second child.\nFrom the early\n1980\ns McDuff worked on symplectic topology. During a sabbatical term at the Institut des Hautes Ãtudes Scientifiques in Paris in\n1985\nshe studied\nGromov\n's work on elliptic methods which became the basis for much of her later work. In\n1984\nshe was promoted to full professor at Stony Brook, being Chair of the Mathematics Department there from\n1991\nto\n93\n.\nMcDuff has received many honours for her remarkable mathematical achievements. In\n1991\nshe was awarded the Ruth Lyttle Satter Prize of the\nAmerican Mathematical Society\n. The quotations we have given in this article are taken from the acceptance speech she gave on the occasion of the presentation of the Prize. Many other honours have come her way, perhaps the most prestigious of which is her election as a Fellow of the\nRoyal Society of London\nin\n1994\n. The citation for her election to the Fellowship read:-\nMcDuff is best known for her work in the geometry of multi-dimensional structures. Her work in symplectic geometry, functional analysis and diffeomorphism groups has provided understanding and unexpected results in a whole range of areas of great importance. Her work is based on a deep and wide mathematical understanding, and has opened an extraordinarily fertile new branch of mathematics.\nIn\n1995\nshe was elected a Fellow of the\nAmerican Academy of Arts and Science\n.\nIn addition to these honours McDuff has been invited to give many prestigious lectures. She gave the Invited Address at the\nAmerican Mathematical Society\nWinter meeting in Atlanta in\n1988\n, the first Progress in Mathematics lecture at the American Mathematical Society Summer meeting in Boulder in\n1989\n, an Invited Address at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Kyoto in\n1990\n, and a Plenary Address at the Second European Congress in Budapest in\n1996\n.\nAlthough her research contributions to mathematics have been truly outstanding, McDuff has given service to mathematics in many other ways. She has been involved in reform of undergraduate teaching at Stony Brook, is on the editorial board of Notices of the\nAmerican Mathematical Society\n, and has been an active member of Women in Science and Engineering. We give one further quote from her acceptance speech of the Ruth Lyttle Satter Prize concerning women in mathematics:-\nI think that there is quite an element of luck in the fact that I have survived as a mathematician. I also got real help from the feminist movement, both emotionally and practically. I think things are somewhat easier now: there is at least a little more institutional support of the needs of women and families, and there are more women in mathematics so that one need not be so isolated. But I don't think that all the problems are solved.\nIn\n1998\nMcDuff was named Distinguished Professor at SUNY at Stony Brook. She is the Helen Lyttle Kimmel '\n42\nProfessor of Mathematics at Barnard College where she teaches \"Introduction to Higher Mathematics\" and courses in geometry and topology. She has continued to receive prestigious awards such as honorary degrees from the University of Edinburgh\n(1997)\nand the University of York\n(2000)\n. In\n2007\nthe\nLondon Mathematical Society\nelected her to Honorary Membership of the Society:-\n...  in recognition of her research in many areas of mathematics and in particular in symplectic topology.\nIn the\nBulletin\nof the\nLondon Mathematical Society\nMcDuff's important contributions which led to her honorary membership are described:-\nIn the early eighties, shortly before\nGromov\n's work on pseudo-holomorphic curves began to move the subject in new directions, McDuff began her study of symplectic topology and geometry. Among her early contributions to the field is a paper on the flux homomorphism and a celebrated theorem on the classification of rational and ruled symplectic\n4\n-manifolds. Her work includes fundamental theorems on the symplectic blowup construction, a theorem on the symplectic packing problem\n(\njoint with Leonid Polterovich\n)\n, and a series of seminal joint papers with FranÃ§ois Lalonde on the symplectic energy and the stability of Hamiltonian flows. Among the many applications of this work is an important extension of\nGromov\n's non-squeezing theorem. This work also introduced a technique called symplectic inflation, an application of which is a theorem of McDuff on the existence of two symplectic structures in the same cohomology class that can be connected by a path of symplectic forms, but not by a path representing the same cohomology class. This is a remarkable result\n(\nand so far the only known phenomenon of its kind\n)\nas the two symplectic forms cannot be distinguished by their\nGromov\n-\nWitten\ninvariants. Among her many other contributions, old and new, are fundamental results on symplectic fibrations, the Hofer metric, Hamiltonian circle actions, and the cohomology of symplectomorphism groups.\nThroughout her distinguished career Dusa McDuff has received various awards, including invitations to address the International and European Congresses of Mathematics, several honorary degrees, a Fellowship of the Royal Society, and a Membership of the National Academy of Sciences. These reflect the inspiration she has been and is to a generation of mathematicians.\nOutside mathematics McDuff says that her interests are reading, chamber music, playing the cello, gardening, walking, and talking to friends.",
