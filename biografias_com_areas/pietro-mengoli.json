  "biografia": "Pietro Mengoli\nwas taught mathematics by\nCavalieri\nat the University of Bologna before he himself taught at Bologna from\n1648\n. While he taught he studied for a doctorate in philosophy which was awarded by the University of Bologna in\n1650\n. Continuing to study while he held chairs of mathematics, three years later he obtained a second doctorate in civil and canon law from Bologna. He was also ordained into the priesthood.\nAfter\nCavalieri\ndied in November\n1647\n, Mengoli had been appointed to his chair at the University of Bologna. Mengoli held a number of chairs at the University of Bologna where he taught all his life. He was professor of arithmetic from\n1648\nto\n1649\n, then professor of mechanics from\n1649\nto\n1668\nand, finally, professor of mathematics from\n1668\nuntil his death in\n1686\n. In addition to these chairs he was also a priest in the parish of Santa Maria Maddelena in Bologna from\n1660\n.\nHis role in the development of mathematics is described in\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nMengoli's mathematics was superficially conservative. He did not subscribe to the innovations of\nTorricelli\n, and his own discoveries were set out in abstruse Latin that made his works laborious to read. His books were nevertheless widely distributed in the seventeenth century, and were known to\nCollins\n,\nWallis\n, and\nLeibniz\n; they were then almost forgotten, so that Mengoli's work has been studied again only recently. His significance to the history of science lies in the transitional position of his mathematics, midway between\nCavalieri\n's method of indivisibles and\nNewton\n's fluxions and\nLeibniz\n's differentials.\nMengoli used infinite series to good effect in\nNovae quadraturae arithmeticae, seu de additione fractionum\nâ\n(\nNew arithmetic of areas, and the addition of fractions\n)\npublished in Bologna in\n1650\n, developing ideas which had first been investigated by\nCataldi\n. He begins with the summation of geometric series, then shows that the harmonic series does not converge. In doing so he became the first person to prove that it was possible for a series whose terms tend to zero to be made larger than any given number. He also investigated the harmonic series with alternating signs which he proved converges to log\n(2)\n. This series was also investigated by\nNicolaus Mercator\n.\nOther interesting results about series in\nNovae quadraturae arithmeticae\nâ\n(\nNew arithmetic of areas, and the addition of fractions\n)\ninclude a study of the sum of reciprocals of the triangular numbers\n1\n2\nn\n(\nn\n+\n1\n)\n{1\\over2}n(n+1)\n2\n1\nâ\nn\n(\nn\n+\n1\n)\n. Mengoli showed that\n1\n3\n+\n1\n6\n+\n1\n10\n+\n1\n15\n+\n.\n.\n.\n+\n1\n1\n2\nn\n(\nn\n+\n1\n)\n=\nn\nâ\n1\nn\n+\n1\n\\large\\frac{1}{3}\\normalsize  + \\large\\frac{1}{6}\\normalsize  + \\large\\frac{1}{10}\\normalsize  + \\large\\frac{1}{15}\\normalsize  + ... + \\large\\frac{1}{{1\\over2}n(n+1)}\\normalsize  = \\large\\frac{n-1}{n+1}\\normalsize\n3\n1\nâ\n+\n6\n1\nâ\n+\n1\n0\n1\nâ\n+\n1\n5\n1\nâ\n+\n.\n.\n.\n+\n2\n1\nâ\nn\n(\nn\n+\n1\n)\n1\nâ\n=\nn\n+\n1\nn\nâ\n1\nâ\n.\nHe then argued that the difference\n1\nâ\nn\nâ\n1\nn\n+\n1\n1 - \\large\\frac{n-1}{n+1}\\normalsize\n1\nâ\nn\n+\n1\nn\nâ\n1\nâ\ncould be made smaller than any given positive number by taking\nn\nn\nn\nlarge enough so the sum of the series was\n1\n. He then showed that\n1\n1\n+\nr\n+\n1\n2\n(\n2\n+\nr\n)\n+\n1\n3\n(\n3\n+\nr\n)\n+\n.\n.\n.\n=\n1\nr\n(\n1\n+\n1\n2\n+\n1\n3\n+\n.\n.\n.\n+\n1\nr\n)\n\\large\\frac{1}{1+r}\\normalsize  + \\large\\frac{1}{2(2+r)}\\normalsize  + \\large\\frac{1}{3(3+r)}\\normalsize  + ... = \\large\\frac{1}{r}\\normalsize (1 + \\large\\frac{1}{2}\\normalsize + \\large\\frac{1}{3}\\normalsize + ... + \\large\\frac{1}{r}\\normalsize )\n1\n+\nr\n1\nâ\n+\n2\n(\n2\n+\nr\n)\n1\nâ\n+\n3\n(\n3\n+\nr\n)\n1\nâ\n+\n.\n.\n.\n=\nr\n1\nâ\n(\n1\n+\n2\n1\nâ\n+\n3\n1\nâ\n+\n.\n.\n.\n+\nr\n1\nâ\n)\nHence for\nr\n=\n1\n,\n2\n,\n3\n,\n.\n.\n.\n,\n10\nr = 1, 2, 3, ... , 10\nr\n=\n1\n,\n2\n,\n3\n,\n.\n.\n.\n,\n1\n0\nMengoli showed that the series whose\nn\nn\nn\nth term is\n1\nn\n(\nn\n+\nr\n)\n\\large\\frac{1}{n(n+r)}\\normalsize\nn\n(\nn\n+\nr\n)\n1\nâ\nconverges having sum\nS\nS\nS\nwhere\nr\n=\n1\n,\nS\n=\n1\nr = 1, S = 1\nr\n=\n1\n,\nS\n=\n1\nr\n=\n2\n,\nS\n=\n3\n4\nr = 2, S = \\large\\frac{3}{4}\\normalsize\nr\n=\n2\n,\nS\n=\n4\n3\nâ\nr\n=\n3\n,\nS\n=\n11\n18\nr = 3, S = \\large\\frac{11}{18}\\normalsize\nr\n=\n3\n,\nS\n=\n1\n8\n1\n1\nâ\nr\n=\n4\n,\nS\n=\n25\n48\nr = 4, S = \\large\\frac{25}{48}\\normalsize\nr\n=\n4\n,\nS\n=\n4\n8\n2\n5\nâ\nr\n=\n5\n,\nS\n=\n137\n300\nr = 5, S = \\large\\frac{137}{300}\\normalsize\nr\n=\n5\n,\nS\n=\n3\n0\n0\n1\n3\n7\nâ\nr\n=\n6\n,\nS\n=\n49\n120\nr = 6, S = \\large\\frac{49}{120}\\normalsize\nr\n=\n6\n,\nS\n=\n1\n2\n0\n4\n9\nâ\nr\n=\n7\n,\nS\n=\n363\n980\nr = 7, S = \\large\\frac{363}{980}\\normalsize\nr\n=\n7\n,\nS\n=\n9\n8\n0\n3\n6\n3\nâ\nr\n=\n8\n,\nS\n=\n761\n2240\nr = 8, S = \\large\\frac{761}{2240}\\normalsize\nr\n=\n8\n,\nS\n=\n2\n2\n4\n0\n7\n6\n1\nâ\nr\n=\n9\n,\nS\n=\n7129\n22680\nr = 9, S = \\large\\frac{7129}{22680}\\normalsize\nr\n=\n9\n,\nS\n=\n2\n2\n6\n8\n0\n7\n1\n2\n9\nâ\nr\n=\n10\n,\nS\n=\n7381\n25200\nr = 10, S = \\large\\frac{7381}{25200}\\normalsize\nr\n=\n1\n0\n,\nS\n=\n2\n5\n2\n0\n0\n7\n3\n8\n1\nâ\nHe also showed that the series whose\nn\nn\nn\nth term was\n1\nn\n(\nn\n+\n1\n)\n(\nn\n+\n2\n)\n\\large\\frac{1}{n(n+1)(n+2)}\\normalsize\nn\n(\nn\n+\n1\n)\n(\nn\n+\n2\n)\n1\nâ\nconverges with sum\n1\n4\n\\large\\frac{1}{4}\\normalsize\n4\n1\nâ\n. However, perhaps not surprisingly, he failed to be able to sum the series whose\nn\nn\nn\nth term is\n1\nn\n2\n\\large\\frac{1}{n^{2}\\normalsize}\nn\n2\n1\nâ\n.\nMengoli also wrote\nGeometriae speciosae elementa\nâ\n(\nSpecial elements of geometry\n)\n(1659)\non limits of geometrical figures. This work, which is examined in detail in\n[\n10\n]\n, is particularly interesting for it contains a definition of a definite integral in terms of the area of a plane figure rigorously given by constructing circumscribing and inscribing parallelograms which sum to equal limits. He defines limits of positive variable quantities using ideas that he had used in looking at limits of series. He called a positive variable quantity\nquasi-infinite\nif it could be made larger than any given number,\nquasi-nil\nif it could be made smaller than any given positive number, and\nquasi-a\nif it could be made smaller than any number greater than\na\na\na\nand greater than any number less than\na\na\na\n. By examining the limits of sums, products and quotients of variable quantities, Mengoli was setting up the basic rules if the calculus thirty years before\nNewton\nand\nLeibniz\n. Both of these were influenced by his contribution, in the case of\nLeibniz\nthe influence was direct as he read Mengoli's work while in the case of\nNewton\nhe knew of it indirectly through studying\nWallis\n.\nIn\nCircolo\n(1672)\nMengoli found an infinite product expansion for\n1\n2\nÏ\n\\large\\frac{1}{2}\\normalsize \\pi\n2\n1\nâ\nÏ\n. He also computed the definite integral\nâ«\n0\n1\nx\nm\n/\n2\n(\n1\nâ\nx\n)\nn\n/\n2\nd\nx\n\\int_0^1  x^{m/2}(1 - x)^{n/2} dx\nâ«\n0\n1\nâ\nx\nm\n/\n2\n(\n1\nâ\nx\n)\nn\n/\n2\nd\nx\n.\nOther work by Mengoli included work on astronomy, work on\nrefraction\nin the atmosphere and a book\nSpeculazioni musicali\n(1670)\non the theory of music. In this Mengoli's criticises of the theory of resonance set out by\nGalileo\n. For details of this work see\n[\n9\n]\nwhere the author describes the \"amazing\" assumption that the human ear has two drums and places this idea in the context of Mengoli's natural philosophy.\nThe paper\n[\n11\n]\nexamines correspondence by Mengoli in which he discusses problems due to\nOzanam\n. This gives new insight into Mengoli's mathematics. The authors:-\n... analyse a little-known aspect of Pietro Mengoli's mathematical activity: the difficulties he faced in trying to solve some problems in Diophantine analysis suggested by\nJ Ozanam\n. Mengoli's recently published correspondence reveals how he cherished his prestige as a scholar. At the same time, however, it also shows that his insufficient familiarity with algebraic methods prevented him, as well as other Italian mathematicians of his time, from solving the so-called 'French' problems.",
