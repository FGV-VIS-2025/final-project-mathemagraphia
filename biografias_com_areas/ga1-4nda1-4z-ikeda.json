  "biografia": "GÃ¼ndÃ¼z Ikeda\n's mother was a school teacher and his father was a statistician. Known as\nMasatoshi Ikeda\nfor the first part of his life spent in Japan, he was the youngest of his parents four children, having two elder sisters and one elder brother. He entered Osaka University to study mathematics, obtaining his Rigaku-Shi degree\n(\nequivalent to a B.Sc.\n)\nin\n1948\n. Of course his education had taken place through the years of World War II and the extremely hard years immediately following the war. He once said of these years:-\nWe were out of food, at the edge of starving, yet we were reading\nPontryagin\n's Topological Groups without skipping a word.\nHe remained at Osaka University, undertaking research on\nFrobenius\nand quasi-Frobenius algebras for his doctorate supervised by\nKenjiro Shoda\n. He worked with a number of mathematicians at Osaka, joining the research group led by\nT Nakayama\n. Ikeda's first publication\nSupplementary remarks on Frobenius algebras\nwas written jointly with\nNakayama\n, and appeared in the\nOsaka Mathematics Journal\nin\n1950\n. He was awarded his doctorate in\n1953\nfor a thesis which included sufficient material for seven excellent published papers. In addition to the paper named above, the seven papers included two further papers on quasi-Frobenius algebras, and one on generalizing GaschÃ¼tz's results on group algebras to\nFrobenius\nrings.\nIkeda was awarded a Yukawa Scholarship to conduct research on cohomology theory of associative algebras at Nagoya University for session\n1953\n-\n54\n. He returned to Osaka University as a Lecturer in Mathematics in\n1954\nwhere he continued working on algebras, and published three further papers on the\ncohomology\nof algebras. In\n1955\nhe attended the Algebraic Number Theory Symposium in Tokyo and it changed the direction of his research. He decided as a result of that meeting to move towards\nalgebraic number theory\nand an Alexander von Humboldt Foundation Fellowship allowed him to spend the years from\n1957\nto\n1959\nas a research fellow at the Mathematisches Seminar of Hamburg University, working with\nHasse\n's research group. His main research during this period was on the embedding problem of\nGalois theory\n.\nAnother important event happened during these years for he met the Turkish research fellow Emel Ardor, also in Hamburg on an Alexander von Humboldt Fellowship. She has written\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nDr Ikeda began to show me his interests. He asked me several questions about Turkey, Turkish, and life and customs in Turkey. I soon found out the reason for this curiosity. His teacher\nProfessor Hasse\nhad visited Turkey a couple of times, he loved Turkey, he had friends and students in Turkey, and he was keen on learning Turkish. Further, he met Prof Orhan IÃ§en in Hamburg, and he knew\nCahit Arf\nby name.\n[\nIkeda\n]\nwas keen on learning new things;\n[\nand\n]\nhe, too, developed a passion for Turkey and Turkish.\nIkeda remained as a Lecturer of Mathematics at Osaka University until\n1960\nwhen he first visited Izmir, Turkey, then visited\nCahit Arf\nat Istanbul University.\nArf\nhad studied in GÃ¶ttingen under\nHasse\n, so the two had many common interests. Ikeda was appointed as Foreign Specialist in Mathematics and Statistics at the Medical School of Ege University in Izmir in\n1960\n. After a while, however, he was appointed Associate Professor of Mathematics in the newly established Mathematics Department of Ege University. Cemal KoÃ§ writes in\n[\n3\n]\nabout this period:-\nIn the summer of\n1963\nas a new graduate I paid a visit to the newly established Mathematics Department of Ege University, in Izmir, to apply for a post. At the very moment of my arrival, they introduced to me a young faculty member: Doctor Ikeda. Apparently he was Japanese, polite yet authoritative, and there was an air of general admiration about him; however the rest was a complete mystery for me.\nAfter KoÃ§ was appointed to Ege University he assisted Ikeda with his teaching. He writes of the help that Ikeda gave to him and others at the university:-\nHaving been newly established, Ege University was short of facilities, resulting in, among other things, a limited number of offices in the Mathematics Department. Thus we assistants found ourselves sharing one single office. However, in time, thanks to Dr Ikeda, we transformed this office to an ongoing seminar room, for we had problems in different areas of mathematics and Dr Ikeda was the only one to lend us a hand so benevolently. His generosity and kindheartedness would touch all the faculty at Ege University, as well as all the mathematics assistants, in all of their diverse areas, supervised by himself or not. He was even often found to be helping many a faculty applicant to associate professorship or professorship in Medicine or Agriculture in their various correlation problems.\nIkeda married Emel Ardor, the Turkish research assistant he had met in Hamburg, in\n1964\n. He also became a Turkish citizen in that year and took a more Turkish sounding name, calling himself GÃ¼ndÃ¼z Ikeda. He spent time at the Middle East Technical University in Ankara, was a Visiting Professor at Hamburg during the Spring Semester of\n1966\n, and then in the following year he was promoted to full Professor at Ege University. In May\n1968\nArf\nand\nLanglands\nvisited Ege University to deliver talks on\nThe Cartan-DieudonnÃ© Theorem and Automorphic Forms\n. At a dinner following the talks,\nArf\noffered Ikeda a position at the Middle East Technical University in Ankara where he was now working. Ikeda accepted and took up the position of Professor there in August of\n1968\nand, together with\nArf\n, worked to build up both the undergraduate and postgraduate sides of the Mathematics Department.\nAlthough Ikeda remained in his post at the Middle East Technical University until\n1976\n, he spent\n1970\n-\n71\nas Visiting Professor of Mathematics at San Diego State University, California, USA. He left the Middle East Technical University in\n1976\n, spent the autumn term of\n1976\nat the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, then during the years\n1976\n-\n78\nhe was Chairman of the Mathematics Department of Hacettepe University. In\n1978\nhe returned to the Middle East Technical University where he remained until he retired in\n1991\n.\nAfter he retired, Ikeda was Visiting Professor of Mathematics at the Eastern Mediterranean University, Gazi Magosa, in Turkish-controlled Northern Cyprus from\n1991\nto\n1993\n, then a Senior Researcher at Marmara Research Center, Gebze, Turkey from\n1993\nto\n1995\n. His next appointment was as Senior Research Scientist at the National Research Institute for Electronics and Cryptology, Gebze, Turkey, between\n1995\nand\n1997\n, where he headed a small research group who concentrated on cryptography. Finally he was a Senior Research Scientist at Feza Gursey Institute, Istanbul, where he returned to his main research topic of algebraic number theory.\nIkeda received many honours for his outstanding contributions. He was awarded the TUBITAK Science Prize\n(1979)\n, the Mustafa Parlar Foundation Science Prize\n(1993)\n, and the Marmara Research Center Merit Prize\n(1994)\n. He was elected to the\nTurkish Academy of Sciences\nin\n1997\n.\nKoÃ§, in\n[\n3\n]\n, quotes some advice that Ikeda gave to young mathematicians:-\nAvoid repeating yourselves in order to increase the number of your publications only. Work out real problems of mathematics no matter how big they are ...\nWhen you have worked on a problem for a long time without any outcome, leave it alone for a while and consider also some relatively small problems to keep up your courage and productivity\n.\nDespite his close friendship with\nArf\n, Ikeda was critical of his contributions to Turkish mathematics. He wrote:-\nTo my regret, however,\nCahit Arf\nnever had pupils\n(\nin a true sense\n)\nin Turkey; it might be because he is too great, or because his works are too hard for common mathematicians. In any case, it is a pity not for\nCahit Arf\nbut for Turkish Mathematics. I really do not see why Arf rings are studied by American mathematicians yet not by Turkish mathematicians, and why his wonderful thesis is intensively re-examined by German mathematicians yet not by Turkish mathematicians. I am sure that the growth of Mathematics in a country is, as history shows, only possible if the mathematicians in that country mathematically understand and stimulate each other. So I should like to emphasize again that it is the task of young Turkish mathematicians to work in these fields, first to learn by heart what\nCahit Arf\ndid, and then to continue further study along the lines indicated by him.\nIkeda's teaching is described as follows\n[\n3\n]\n:-\n... he would always prefer to cover many diverse concepts and techniques with their essential features. ... His lectures included neither unnecessary material, nor unnecessary ornaments and digressions. He was meticulous about the content and rigorous in his lectures.\nHis character is well illustrated by the comments:-\nHe was so kindhearted and benevolent that probably there was very few who met him that did not receive profound suggestions and advice to improve their work and ideas. In some gatherings, participants often urged him to talk on mathematics and mathematicians in general.",
