  "biografia": "Gheorghe VrÄnceanu\nwas born into a family of poor peasants. He attended primary school in his own village and, while at primary school his teacher, G Arnautescu, realised his great potential. Arnautescu helped Gheorghe to move to Vaslui High School in\n1912\n, where Gheorghe discovered his love of mathematics.\nVrÄnceanu was awarded an Adamachi scholarship to study at Iasi University, which he entered in\n1919\n, and there he was taught mathematics by Alexandru, Vera Myller, Simeon Sanielevici, Victor Valcovici and Simeon Stoilow, all famous Romanian mathematicians of that time. VrÄnceanu was very highly regarded by his professors and, on\n15\nFebruary\n1922\n, he graduated from the University of Iasi. However, while still a student in his third year, VrÄnceanu was appointed, on\n1\nDecember\n1921\n, as an assistant to the mathematics seminar at the request of S Sanielevici. After a brilliant undergraduate career VrÄnceanu went first to GÃ¶ttingen in\n1923\nwhere he studied under\nHilbert\n, then he went to Rome to study for his doctorate in mathematics.\nIn Rome VrÄnceanu studied under\nLevi-Civita\n, obtaining his doctorate on\n5\nNovember\n1924\nfor a dissertation\nSopra una teorema di Weierstrass e le sue applicazioni alla stabilita\nâ\n(\nOn a theorem of Weierstrass and its applications to stability\n)\nwhich gave a new proof of a theorem on the decomposition of analytical functions of more variables and also studied applications of the theorem to mechanics. The examining board consisted of\n11\nprofessors, headed by\nVolterra\n. His doctoral thesis, and all his earlier publications, concerned applications of analysis to mechanics. VrÄnceanu returned to Iasi and, in\n1926\n, still developing ideas suggested by\nLevi-Civita\n, VrÄnceanu discovered the notion of a non-holonomic space. Today this concept is named after VrÄnceanu.\nAlthough only\n26\nyears old when he made this remarkable discovery, it quickly turned him into a celebrity. He was appointed a lecturer at Iasi University and then, during\n1927\n-\n1928\n, he was awarded a Rockefeller scholarship to study in France and in the United States. In Paris he worked with\nÃlie Cartan\nand then he went to the United States where he studied at Harvard University and Princeton University. He met\nBirkhoff\nand\nVeblen\nand later they became good friends. When his scholarship came to an end he was offered a position as a professor but he preferred to return to Romania, taking up his post in Iasi.\nIn\n1929\nVrÄnceanu moved to Cernauti University where he was appointed professor of analytical geometry, then still at Cernauti he was appointed professor of Differential and Integral Geometry in the following year. After\n10\nyears of great mathematical activity at Cernauti University, he was asked to fill in the professorship at Bucharest University which had become vacant on the death of\nGheorghe ÈiÈeica\nin\n1939\n. In\n1948\nVrÄnceanu was appointed Head of Geometry and\nTopology\nat Bucharest University. He retired from his chair in\n1970\n, continuing to take an active interest in mathematics at the university.\nDuring his time at Cernauti University VrÄnceanu became known as one of the leading geometers in the world. In\n1928\nat the International Congress of Mathematics in Bologna, the notion of a non-holonomic space which he had discovered was studied by\nSchouten\nand\nCartan\n. Meanwhile VrÄnceanu made new discoveries in global geometry.\nAt Bucharest University VrÄnceanu began to organise the mathematics library in a similar way to the one in Iasi. He formed his own group of young geometers and together they wrote teaching texts, as well as the\n4\nvolumes of a\ndifferential geometry\ntext, later translated in German and French. Besides his major contributions to science, VrÄnceanu took an active interest in politics. In\n1944\nhe was one of the founders of a movement which tried to prevent Romania from fighting against Russia.\nVrÄnceanu organised the Mathematical Institute of the\nRomanian Academy\n, a very important step for theoretical and applied researches in his country. Until his death, he was an editor of the\nMathematical Studies and Researches\nand the\nRevue Roumaine de MathÃ©matiques Pures et AppliquÃ©es\n. He tried to make known all the Romanian discoveries in mathematics to the international mathematical community. He also organised many scientific conferences, both inside and outside Romania, the last one being held in September\n1978\nin Craiova. He was much in demend as a lecturer, being invited to lecture at over\n30\ninstitutions world-wide, for example he lectured at universities in Paris, Rome, Princeton, Moscow, Peking, Berlin, London, Salamanca, Geneva and many others.\nDuring his career, VrÄnceanu published over\n300\narticles in journals throughout the world. They cover all the branches of modern geometry, from the classical theory of surfaces to the notion of non-holonomic spaces which he discovered, creating efficient methods and solving fundamental problems. Other topics he studied include the absolute differential calculus of congruences, analytical mechanics,\npartial differential equations\nof the second order, non-holonomic unitary theory, conformal connection spaces, metrics in spherical and projective spaces,\nLie groups\n, global differential geometry, discrete\ngroups\nof affine connection spaces, locally Euclidean connection spaces, Riemannian spaces of constant connection, differentiable varieties, embedding of lens spaces into Euclidean space,\ntangent\nvectors of spheres and exotic spheres, the equivalence method, non-linear connection spaces, and the geometry of mechanical systems.\nVrÄnceanu won many honours, both in his own country and elsewhere. He was elected to the\nRomanian Academy\nas a corresponding member in\n1946\n, then as a full member in\n1955\n. From\n1964\nhe was President of the Mathematics Section of the\nRomanian Academy\n. He won a Government Award\n(1952)\nand other medals and awards for excellence. He was awarded honorary degrees from Bologna University\n(1967)\nand Iasi University\n(1970)\n. He was also elected to the Peloritana dei Pericolanti University in Messina\n(1968)\nand the Royal Flamand Academy of Brussels\n(1970)\n. He was elected a member of the Royal Society of LiÃ¨ge in\n1972\n.\nVrÄnceanu served as a member of the International Committee of the\nInternational Mathematical Union\nfor many years and, in that capacity, he was involved in publishing the complete works of\nÃlie Cartan\n. In\n1975\nVrÄnceanu was elected Vice-president of the\nInternational Mathematical Union\n.",
