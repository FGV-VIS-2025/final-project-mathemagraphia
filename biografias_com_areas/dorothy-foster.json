  "biografia": "Dorothy Foster\nwas the only child of Thomas Sidney Foster, a bank clerk, and his wife Elizabeth Flintoff, a bank cashier. Sydney Foster\n(\nborn\n1902)\nhad married Elizabeth Flintoff\n(\nborn\n1896)\nin\n1932\nin Darlington, County Durham. The family came from Darlington, County Durham and, with her cousin Joy Tabrum, was the direct descendent of the Dixon family of Raby, Cockfield and Newcastle-upon-Tyne. This came through Dorothy's maternal grandparents who were William Flintoff\n(1851\n-\n1903)\nand Mary Amy Dixon\n(1849\n-\n1914)\n. The Dixon fortunes originated in the coal seams under Cockfield Fell, but the family included Jeremiah Dixon\n(1733\n-\n1779)\n, an astronomer who surveyed part of the Mason-Dixon Line, and his brother George Dixon\n(1731\n-\n1796)\n, who first lit a house with coal gas and produced coal tar. For more information about  Jeremiah Dixon and George Dixon, see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nOther Cockfield family members were engineers who worked with George and Robert Stephenson on the Stockton to Darlington and Liverpool to Manchester Railways.\nThe Newcastle branch of the family also produced three noted engineers. John Dixon\n(1835\n-\n1891)\nand his brother Waynman designed a special ship, theÂ Cleopatra,Â to transport the obelisk known as Cleopatra's Needle to London from Alexandria. Their brother, Raylton, owned and ran the Cleveland Dockyard, the largest boatyard on the Tees; he was Mayor of Middlesbrough and was knighted for services to shipbuilding. Of these three engineers, Waynman was a genial man and worked with both brothers, but John and Raylton were rather more combative and competitive. Joy Tabrum\n[\n1\n]\nsuspects this was a common Dixon family trait.\nDorothy Foster grew up in Darlington, living at\n15\nDale Road. She attended Polam Hall School from\n1941\nto\n1952\n. This school had been founded by the Quakers in\n1848\nas a small finishing school for girls. The main School building was once the private mansion of Jonathan Backhouse, the founder of Barclays Bank. Dorothy excelled at Polam Hall School, consistently ranked\n1\nst or\n2\nnd in her class. The reports for her mathematics studies in the Autumn Term of\n1951\nare as follows\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nPure Mathematics\n: Dorothy is working very hard and her work is always of a high standard. Dorothey works independently and shows powers of selection when tackling problems. She should do well!\nApplied Mathematics\n: Dorothy continues to do work of a high standard. She deserves to do very well.\nHer school Report for\n1952\nis as follows\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nScripture:\nAlways interested and most attentive.\nEnglish:\nStyle imaginative, but Dorothy worked extremely well in her coaching periods, and overcame many difficulties she had previously experienced.\nLatin:\nDorothy is a keen and steady worker and deserves to do well in her examination.\nGames:\nDorothy could be a really good tennis player if she gave more time to practice.\nForm Mistress's Report:\nDorothy has devoted herself so wholeheartedly to her work that it has been a real pleasure to teach her; I hope she meets with the success she so well deserves.\nGeneral Conduct:\nDorothy has always maintained a high standard of conduct, and had set a good example to the school.\nDorothy sat the University of Cambridge General Certificate Examinations in the Summer of\n1952\npassing Latin, Mathematics and Further Mathematics at the Advanced Level and the General Paper at the Ordinary Level. Having sent these results to Bedford College, University of London, on\n17\nAugust\n1952\nshe received the following reply from the Assistant to the Registrar sent on the following day:-\nSince you have passed in the required papers in Mathematics and Further Mathematics and in Latin at the Advanced Level, you are qualified to begin reading for a B.A. Honours degree in Mathematics on entering the College in October. A place has been reserved for you in Reid Hall.\nShe began her studies at Bedford College on Tuesday,\n7\nOctober\n1952\n, graduating with a B.Sc. in Mathematics inÂ\n1956\n. She received a letter dated\n13\nJuly\n1955\ncongratulating her on being placed First Class in the examinations. It also informed her that she had been awarded a postgraduate studentship.\nShe described the Mathematics Department at Bedford College as being:-\n... quite small in the\n1950\ns and staff-student relations were informal and friendly. All our lecturers had a heavy teaching load, not uncommon at that time, so there was no provision for weekly tutorials.\nOne of her lecturers at Bedford College was\nGeoffrey Kneebone\n. Dorothy wrote:-\nDr\nKneebone\n, as well as giving excellent lectures, always managed to discuss our weekly written work with us individually. In our first year both he and Mrs Kneebone invited us to their home. On revisiting him on the occasion of the sesquicentenary celebrations of Bedford College inÂ\n1999\nÂ he was as friendly and welcoming as ever.\nHer first paper\nIndefinite quadratic polynomials inÂ nÂ variables\n, published in\n1956\n, gives her address as Bedford College. The research for this work must have been done soon after she sat her degree examinations. She was appointed as an Assistant Lecturer in Mathematics at Royal Holloway College, London in\n1957\n. Her next paper was\nOn a class of quadratic polynomials inÂ nÂ variables\n(1958)\nwritten soon after she began working for a Ph.D. advised by John Henry H Chalk\n(1922\n-\n2004)\n. She writes in this paper\n[\n4\n]\n:-\nI am very grateful to Dr J H H Chalk for all his help and encouragement during my work on this problem.\nDorothy's thesis was\nSome arithmetical properties of quadratic polynomials\n(\nMay\n1960)\n. She writes in the Preface\n[\n3\n]\n:-\nThe problems discussed in this thesis arise in the geometry of numbers, a part of the theory of numbers which originated under the inspiration of\nMinkowski\nat the turn of the last century.\nThe first chapter is introductory and provides the background to the main part of the thesis. The well known theorems which are needed later are stated without proofs, reference being given in the appendix. In each of the remaining three chapters a different problem is considered and is preceded by a short summary. The theorems are numbered according to the chapter in which they occur.\nThe subject matter of this thesis has been suggested by my supervisor, D J H H Chalk. I am very deeply indebted to him for all his invaluable help and encouragement throughout its preparation.\n... Finally I should like to thank Professor W N Bailey for suggesting the theory of numbers as a subject for research, and the University of London for their award of a postgraduate studentship for fifteen months.\nWilfred Norman Bailey\n(1893\n-\n1961)\nwas Head of Mathematics at Bedford College when Dorothy studied there, retiring in\n1958\nbefore she completed her research. In fact there had been a difficulty with Dorothy's Ph.D. studies for, in the middle of her work, her Ph.D. supervisor J H H Chalk had left Bedford College and moved to the University of Toronto in Canada. Supervision had been by letter over the final stages but she had overcome these difficulties seemingly with ease. The Vice-Chancellor, acting on behalf of the Senate, conferred the degree of Ph.D. in the Faculty of Arts\n(\nTheory of Numbers\n)\non her 'in absentia' on\n30\nAugust\n1960\n.\nIn February\n1960\n, even before she had submitted her thesis to Royal Holloway College, Dorothy Foster was appointed to the Department of Mathematics at the University of St Andrews. She received a letter from David M Devine, Joint Clerk to the University Court, written on\n8\nFebruary\n1960\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nI am writing to confirm the offer which was made to you verbally on Saturday of appointment as Lecturer in Mathematics in St Salvator's College in this University.\nThe head of the Department of Mathematics was\nEdward Copson\nwho was the Regius Professor of Mathematics. At this time St Andrews had two mathematics departments, the other being the Department of Applied Mathematics. In the second half of the\n1960\ns the Department of Mathematics changed its name to the Department of Pure Mathematics. Dorothy continued as a member of Pure Mathematics throughout her career, although the Department later became the Division of Pure Mathematics in the School of Mathematics and Statistics.\nShe wrote\n12\npapers between\n1956\nand\n1992\n, five of them co-authored with George Phillips, namely\nThe arithmetic-harmonic mean\n(1984)\n;\nA generalization of the Archimedean double sequence\n(1984)\n;\nThe approximation of certain functions by compound means\n(1984)\n,\nGeneral compound means\n(1985)\n; and\nDouble mean processes\n(1986)\n. Her final three single authored papers were:\nEstimates for a remainder term associated with the sum of digits function\n(1987)\n;\nA lower bound for a remainder term associated with the sum of digits function\n(1991)\n; and\nAveraging the sum of digits function to an even base\n(1992)\n.\nAs a lecturer Dorothy was always exceptionally well prepared, with well thought out lectures. When I\n[\nEFR\n]\nwas a student attending her lectures in the first half of the\n1960\ns it was still a chalk and blackboard time and Dorothy would write extremely fast, with seldom a pause. I attended a complex variable course she taught but the other one of her courses I attended was tragic. It began as a course on linear algebra given by Arthur Hinton Read who taught the material in a \"linear transformations of vector spaces\" style. In the middle of the course, one December Monday morning, Professor\nCopson\ncame into the classroom and gave us the tragic news that Arthur Read had died in an avalanche while mountain climbing that weekend. Dorothy Foster then took over the linear algebra course and taught it in her style, namely matrices as boxes of numbers. Dorothy gave an outstanding advanced course on number theory. One student, Nigel Watt, studied Dorothy's number theory course in the\n1980\ns and took her advice to carry on to study for a Ph.D. in number theory with Martin Neil Huxley at Cardiff University. Nigel Watt has had a highly successful university careeer with around\n30\nnumber theory publications.\nDorothy was the local organiser of the\n1984\nEdinburgh Mathematical Society\nColloquium held in St Andrews. Werner Georg Nowak attended this conference and in a letter sent from Vienna to Dorothy Foster on\n28\nJune\n1988\n, he writes:-\nI have to apologise deeply for being so terribly late in fulfilling my promise to send you some of my material\n(4\nyears is in fact an enormous delay!\n)\n; all I can say as a sort of excuse is that, for some time, I was waiting till my work on the problems we discussed in St Andrews\n(\ndivisors in arithmetic progressions and similar topics\n)\nwould have reached a certain final stage. This, however, did not happen up to the moment; in fact, I am going to talk on an\n-estimate concerning the divisor problem in arithmetic progressions in a splinter group of this year's St Andrews Colloquium.\nAnyway, I look forward with great pleasure to meet you again ... Needless to say that I am still very grateful to you for all you did for me during my stay at St Andrews, in particular for the nice excursion in your car and the tea at your home. ...\nIn\n1992\nDorothy retired from her lectureship at the University of St Andrews. I\n[\nEFR\n]\nremember the day when she walked past my office carrying her electric fire. My office door was always open and she called to me from the corridor, \"I'm off now. Goodbye.\" I replied, \"But we'll see you back in the Mathematical Institute from time to time, won't we, Dorothy.\" She replied simply, \"No. Goodbye.\" Of course I saw her frequently over the years of her retirement but I do not remember seeing her in the Mathematical Institute again.\nIn\n2003\nGeoffrey Kneebone\n, who had taught Dorothy at Bedford College, died and Dorothy, together with fellow student Glenys Ingram, founded the\nGeoffrey Kneebone\nScholarship which is available for a full-time postgraduate student studying MScÂ Mathematics for Applications or MSc Mathematics of Cryptography and Communications at Royal Holloway.\nJohn Tuck, the Director of Library Services, Royal Holloway College, wrote to Dorothy on\n14\nSeptember\n2015\n:-\nRoyal Holloway Library Services is pleased to announce that over the coming months\n2\n,\n000\nRoyal Holloway and Bedford New College research theses will be made available online, and yours is one of the theses that has been selected.\nWe wish to celebrate Royal Holloway and Bedford New College's outstanding record of scholarship through this project, and promote the research output of Royal Holloway and Bedford New Colleges as widely as possible. We see this collection as being of interest for the theses themselves, and also to throw light on the kinds of research that were undertaken in the earlier years of the College.\nIn\n2018\nthe\nLondon Mathematical Society\nrecorded that Dorothy had been a member of the Society for\n60\nyears.\nDorothy had many interests in addition to mathematics. She enjoyed sports, playing tennis on the lawn behind Lower College Hall in the\n1960\ns before the North Haugh tennis courts were built. In the late\n1960\ns and early\n1970\n's the University of St Andrews had small honours classes studying Pure Mathematics and some of the lecturers would go putting on the Himalayas on Wednesday afternoons with the Senior Honours students. Dorothy was an expert putter and we were all surprised to see just how competitive she was. But Dorothy was multi-talented - she was an accomplished pianist and had an enthusiastic interest in literature. She was, for many years, a strong supporter of the Jane Austen Society. She was also an excellent baker and I enjoyed several delightful afternoon teas at her home in Irvine Crescent, St Andrews. Dorothy never lost her interest in mathematics, however, and one of her near neighbours, a retired professor of German, told me that one of the last times he spoke to her she was explaining the 'Seven Bridges of KÃ¶nigsberg problem' to him.\nShe died\n[\n5\n]\n:-\n... peacefully, in her sleep, in St Andrews, aged\n87\nyears, on\n2\nnd July,\n2021\n. Loved by her family, friends and will be sadly missed.",
