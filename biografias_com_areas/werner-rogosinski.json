  "biografia": "Werner Rogosinski\nwas known to his friends and colleagues as\nRogo\n. His parents were Hermann Rogosinski, a counsellor in Breslau, and Helma Braun. Werner was born in Breslau, at that time a German town, although his parents were from Jewish Polish families. The city is now in Poland and known by its Polish name of WrocÅaw. Werner had a sister Lotte and a younger brother Kurt. It was a musical family and Werner learnt to play the piano and violin as a child. His brother Kurt became a professional pianist.\nIn\n1900\n, Werner entered the St Maria Magdalena\nGymnasium\nin Breslau\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nThis was a humanistic gymnasium with strong emphasis on Latin and Greek at which Werner excelled. There was little science and the mathematics course contained no calculus but plenty of geometry. Rogo was happy at school and considered that the training obtained there provided an excellent background for a future pure mathematician. He remained all his life strongly opposed to early specialisation.\nRogosinski graduated from the Gymnasium in\n1913\nand entered Breslau University to study mathematics. However, World War I began in July\n1914\nand, in the following month, Germany declared war on both Russia and France. Rogosinski's studies were interrupted by the war and he undertook military service as a corporal in the medical corps. When he was able to continue his studies he spent time at Freiburg im Breisgau before moving to GÃ¶ttingen to study for his doctorate. At this time GÃ¶ttingen University was probably the best place in the world to study mathematics and Rogosinski flourished, undertaking research directed by\nEdmund Landau\n. At this stage\nLandau\nwas interested in number theory, in particular\nDirichlet\nseries that he had studied for his own doctorate, and it was in this area that Rogosinski worked for his thesis. The particular problem Rogosinski studied involved the\nDirichlet\ndivisor problem, particularly studying a series expansion given by\nGeorgy Voronoy\n. Now\nLandau\nhad managed to get some new results but had failed to solve other variants. Rogosinski gave a new proof of\nVoronoy\n's results as well as solving the cases which had baffled\nLandau\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nRogosinski's solution greatly pleased\nLandau\nand it was from this time that their close friendship developed.\nThis work appeared in Rogosinski's doctoral dissertation\nNeue Anwendung der Pfeifferschen Methode bei Dirichlets Teilerproblem\nâ\n(\nNew applications of Pfeiffer's method to the Dirichlet divisor problem\n)\nwhich he submitted to GÃ¶ttingen University in\n1921\nand was awarded the degree on\n25\nJanuary\n1922\n.\nLandau\nwas an outstanding mathematician but he had a reputation as having an arrogant manner which annoyed his colleagues. He was held in awe by the many bright young students he supervised, but Rogosinski seems to have had a rather different relationship with him. This is illustrated by a nice little episode related by Walter Hayman\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nOn one occasion\n[\nRogosinski\n]\ncut out photographs of the heads of all\n[\nLandau\n's graduate students\n]\nand assembled them as a picture of a group in a little perambulator being pushed by\nLandau\ndressed as a nurse from Spreewald.\nLandau\n, to whom the picture was presented, placed it where everyone was bound to see it sooner or later!\nRogosinski was appointed to the University of KÃ¶nigsberg as a\nPrivatdocent\nin\n1923\nand began publishing papers which typified the contributions he made throughout his life to the theory of functions and to the theory of series. In the following years he published\nÃber Bildschranken bei Potenzreihen und ihren Abschnitten\nâ\n(\nOn image sensors in power series and their sections\n)\n(1923)\n,\nZur Theorie der Dirichletschen Reihen\nâ\n(\nOn the theory of Dirichlet series\n)\n(1924)\n,\nEin Satz tiber Dirichletsche Reihen\nâ\n(\nA set tibet Dirichlet series\n)\n(1924)\n,\nÃber die Abschnitte der Fourierreihen\nâ\n(\nOn sections of  Fourier series\n)\n(1924)\n, and\nÃber die Abschnitte trigonometrischer Reihen\nâ\n(\nOn sections of trigonometric series\n)\n(1925)\n. When Rogosinski arrived at the University of KÃ¶nigsberg, the Mathematics Department was small but had an excellent ordinary professor in\nKonrad Knopp\n. In\n1925\nRichard Brauer\narrived but the arrival of\nGÃ¡bor SzegÅ\nin\n1926\nwas particularly important to Rogosinski since the two quickly became both firm friends and mathematical collaborators. Their first joint paper was\nÃber die Abschnitte von Potenzreihen, die in einem Kreise beschrÃ¤nkt bleiben\nâ\n(\nOn sections of power series, which remain confined in a circle\n)\n(1928)\n. The Department was further strengthened in\n1927\nwith the arrival of\nKurt Reidemeister\n.\nErna Raphael, a friend of Rogosinski's sister Lotte from a young age, had been a friend from childhood. Werner and Erna wanted to marry but had to wait until he was earning a salary, rather than living in relative poverty which was the position of a Privatdocent. This happened in\n1928\nwhen he was promoted to an extraordinary professor and, on the\n27\nSeptember of that year, Werner and Erna were married. The next five years were excellent ones for the Rogosinskis. A steady stream of high quality papers was supplemented in\n1930\nby the publication of his first book, namely\nFouriersche Reihen\nâ\n(\nFourier series\n)\n. This book on\nFourier\nseries was based on lectures that Rogosinski gave on the topic at the University of KÃ¶nigsberg. His students had not studied the\nLebesgue\nintegral so the book did not use this approach, something that Rogosinski planned to change in a new edition but political events in Germany over the following few years meant that all plans had to be cast aside. Before we look at these events, however, we note the hospitality that the Rogosinskis' home in KÃ¶nigsberg offered to their wide range of friends. The family increased in size in\n1932\nwith the birth of their son Peter.\nLife changed for all German people of Jewish background in\n1933\nwhen Hitler came to power. On\n1\nApril there was the so-called \"boycott day\" when Jewish shops were boycotted and Jewish lecturers were not allowed to enter the university. On\n7\nApril\n1933\nthe \"Restoration of the Civil Service\" Law was passed which provided the means of removing Jewish teachers from the universities and, of course, also to remove those of Jewish descent from other roles. All civil servants who were not of Aryan descent\n(\nhaving one grandparent of the Jewish religion made someone non-Aryan\n)\nwere to be retired. There was, however, a clause which exempted those who had fought for Germany in World War I or had been in office since August\n1914\n.\nReidemeister\nwas forced to leave his chair in KÃ¶nigsberg in\n1933\nby the Nazis, whom he strongly opposed, since they classed him as 'politically unsound'.\nRichard Brauer\n, being Jewish, was dismissed from his KÃ¶nigsberg position. Both\nSzegÅ\nand Rogosinski had fought for Germany in World War I so were not immediately dismissed. Despite the terrible position that Rogosinski was in his fine sense of humour did not desert him\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nIn\n1934\nhe told his colleagues that if the Nazis revoked his Venia Legendi he would open a cigar shop near the university and supply his former colleagues and the administrative personnel with cigars having special labels.\nSzegÅ\ngave up the struggle against the Nazi anti-Semitic policies and, anticipating his dismissal, accepted a position at Washington University at St Louis in\n1935\n. Rogosinski carried on despite his position becoming more and more difficult until, in\n1936\n, he was dismissed from his professorship. He moved to Berlin and, during the year\n1936\n-\n37\n, taught mathematics in Jewish schools there. His life was saved in\n1937\nby\nG H Hardy\nand\nJ E Littlewood\nwhen, realising the danger he was in and also the remarkable mathematics he had produced, they invited him to England to join them at the University of Cambridge. Rogosinski went immediately to Cambridge and, six months later, his wife and young son Peter joined him. There followed a few difficult years having to live on a small grant which had been provided by the Society for the Protection of Science and Learning following strong recommendations from\nHardy\nand\nLittlewood\n. However, collaboration between these fine mathematicians provided Rogosinski with a period of exceptional productivity and enjoyment. In\n1939\nhis important paper\nOn subordinate functions\nappeared in the\nProceedings\nof the Cambridge Philosophical Society, communicated by\nG H Hardy\n. Rogosinski begins the paper as follows:-\nThe so-called\nLindelÃ¶f\nprinciple is nothing more than a transformation and systematic application of the simple\nSchwarz\nlemma. Nevertheless, it is a very powerful tool for the solution of many questions in the theory of functions. It is based on the conception of \"subordinate\" functions. In this paper I make some further observations on this principle and also aim at giving precision to it in the case of \"locally schlicht\" functions.\nIn\n1941\nthe University of Aberdeen, having a number of staff on war service, appointed Rogosinski as an assistant lecturer in mathematics. The pay was poor and the position was far too junior for a fine mathematician like Rogosinski at the peak of his abilities but it provided him with a stepping stone which must have made him feel that he was fortunate. He also found a colleague in\nA J Macintyre\n(\nmarried to the mathematician\nSheila Macintyre\n)\nwho joined him in an interesting collaboration. Together they published the note\nSome elementary inequalities in function theory\n(1945)\nand later the major\n50\n-page paper\nExtremum problems in the theory of analytic functions\n(1950)\n. In\n1944\nRogosinski's collaboration with\nHardy\nled to the publication of their book\nFourier Series\n. This was, in many ways, the book that Rogosinski had planned as a rewrite of\nFouriersche Reihen\nâ\n(\nFourier series\n)\nbut based on the\nLebesgue\nintegral.\nE C Titchmarsh\nwrites\n[\n5\n]\n:-\n... the appearance of a Cambridge tract by\nHardy\nand Rogosinski is to be welcomed. It is definitely a book for the pure mathematician, but it should appeal to a large class of readers. It is really quite easy to read. A fair background of knowledge is an advantage, though very little is assumed. The theory is introduced in a \"modern\" manner; \"\nHilbert space\n\", \"strong convergence\", \"closure\", \"completeness\", and general methods of summability are the conspicuous features. ... We believe that it will give a great many mathematicians all over the world as much pleasure to read, as it must have given the authors pleasure to write.\nA second edition of this work was published in\n1950\n, a Russian translation was published in\n1959\n(\nreprinted in\n1962)\n, and a Czech translation was published in\n1971\n.\nRogosinski lectured to the\nEdinburgh Mathematical Society\nin the summer of\n1945\nand, a consequence of this lecture became the book\nVolume and integral\n(1952)\npublished in the Oliver and Boyd Series of University Mathematical Texts.\nWinifred Sargent\nbegins her review of this undergraduate text as follows\n[\n4\n]\n:-\nThis new and welcome addition to a well known collection provides a clear and, in view of its price and size, a surprisingly comprehensive introduction to the theories of measure and integration in Euclidean space\nR\nn\n\\mathbb{R}_{n}\nR\nn\nâ\nof\nn\nn\nn\ndimensions.\nReviewing the same book,\nRalph Jeffery\nwrites:-\nThis book has been written \"primarily for third year Honours students\" in the Universities of Great Britain. ... This book is well suited for the purpose the author had in mind. It gives a complete treatment of absolutely convergent integrals in Euclidean space. The proofs are brief and elegant, and at the same time easy to follow.\nIn\n1945\nRogosinski moved to Newcastle when he was appointed as a lecturer at King's College, University of Durham\n(\nKing's College did not become the University of Newcastle until\n1963)\n. There he was promoted to reader in mathematical analysis in\n1947\nand then to the chair of pure mathematics at King's College in\n1948\nwhen\nA C Offord\nresigned to take up his appointment to the chair at Birkbeck College, London. He also became head of the Mathematics Department and Walter Hayman writes of his time in this role in\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nHe was an excellent Head of Department with a real flair in his appointments. Nearly all of the men he first chose have become professors or readers. ... in Newcastle\n[\nthe Rogosinskis' hospitality\n]\nflourished as never before. After every Colloquium all the staff in pure mathematics were invited in, perhaps\n15\npersons in all and the tables were covered with delicious food. Werner was himself a most stimulating lecturer, convinced of the tremendous importance of mathematics and taking a great delight in every new result that was proved. In all this he was most generous. On one occasion he produced a fine theorem. When he told one of his younger colleagues about this, the latter suggested a slight generalization. Rogo was very pleased and refused to remember in any way that he had made the original discovery.\nIn November\n1953\n,\nJ E Littlewood\nproposed Rogosinski for admission into the\nRoyal Society\nof London. The proposal was seconded by\nA S Besicovitch\n,\nJ C Burkill\n,\nA E Ingham\n,\nM L Cartwright\nand\nW D V Hodge\n. They describe his qualifications in a rather understated way as follows:-\nDistinguished for his contributions to Mathematical Analysis, especially in the theory of\nFourier Series\nand Allied Subjects.\nRogosinski was elected a fellow of the\nRoyal Society\non\n18\nMarch\n1954\n. Another similar distinction which was given to him was election to the\nDanish Academy of Sciences\nin\n1962\n. In fact, after retiring from the King's College chair in\n1959\n, he had moved to Denmark where he had been invited to join the Institute of Mathematics at Aarhus. He spent the last years of his life there.\nWalter Hayman paints a nice picture in\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nRogosinski was a good and kind man genuinely loved by all who knew him. His cheerfulness and vitality were enough to infect any company he was in and where he was it was truly 'gemtitlich'. Beneath his cheerful and out-going nature he had however a serious side. Thus he felt deeply about the events that had happened in Germany and would never go back there. Although in very poor circumstances himself he helped his sister and her husband to escape. His mother and elder brother Rudolf were less fortunate. Mention has been made of Rogo's interest in music. He hated anyone to cough or make a noise let alone talk when music was being played in the Concert Hall or in the home. He also collected stamps, English Commonwealth and old German. He liked going for long tramps. Mathematics was his passion and in his company it was impossible not to believe in the importance of mathematics generally and classical analysis in particular.",
