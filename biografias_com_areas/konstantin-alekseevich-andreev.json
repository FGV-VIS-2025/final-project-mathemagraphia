  "biografia": "Konstantin Alekseevich Andreev\n's family were merchants. Both his father and his paternal grandfather were fur traders. However, when Konstantin Alekseevich was young his father's business collapsed and the family suffered severe hardship. But financial problems were not all that troubled the family for Konstantin Alekseevich had very poor health as a child. An injury to one of his eyes left him partially sighted through his life. These problems made it impossible for Konstantin Alekseevich to attend school until he was twelve years of age. At this time he entered the Third High School in Moscow. Despite the difficulties he had suffered and his lack of schooling, he made remarkable progress, studying from books on his own as well as learning from his teachers. At age fourteen he was sufficiently advanced that he was able to give private tutoring from his home. This let him earn some extra money which helped him purchase books to further his own education.\nIn\n1867\nAndreev entered the mathematics department in the Faculty of Physics and Mathematics of Moscow State University. He wrote about his time as a students in an autobiographical sketch and this is quoted in\n[\n4\n]\n:-\nI think my time as a student was definitely the best time of my life. I got my first experience of independent work on science. I realised the unimaginably vast and fascinating perspectives of the scientific challenges for the mind. I had the examples of my professors who showed so much personal devotion and love for science.\nAmong the professors who influenced Andreev so much during his undergraduate years, he mentions in particular\nAugust Yulevich Davidov\nand\nNicolai Vasilievich Bugaev\n. He expresses how grateful he is that they showed him the way to become a scientist and also because they had faith in his abilities. While he was a student, Andreev wrote an essay\nOn mortality tables\nfor which he was awarded a gold medal. The quality of the essay was so high it was published in the\nMemoirs of Moscow University\nin\n1871\n, becoming Andreev's first publication. In this same year of\n1871\nAndreev began graduate studies taking the two-year course which was necessary preparation for becoming a university professor. During his years as a graduate student he joined the\nMoscow Mathematical Society\nin\n1872\n. He passed the examinations at the end of the graduate course in\n1873\nand was awarded a Master's degree in pure mathematics. In that year a vacancy occurred at Kharkov University and\nBugaev\nstrongly recommended Andreev for the position. He was invited to Kharkov where he defended his\nhabilitation\nthesis in December\n1873\n. He taught at Kharkov University as a\nprivatdocent\nfrom January\n1874\n, starting to teach his first course on analytical geometry at that time.\nEgorov\nwrites\n[\n4\n]\n:-\n... thus began his long-long scientific and teaching activities, to which he devoted his entire life, working selflessly for the benefit of Russian science and Russian education.\nAt Kharkov, Andreev joined the Faculty of Physics and Mathematics which he helped build into a leading centre. Kharkov University had been founded in\n1805\n. The city of Kharkov, thanks to its educational establishments, became one of the most important cultural and educational centres of Ukraine. From the foundation of the university, leading mathematicians had worked there such as\nTimofei Fedorovic Osipovsky\nand\nMikhail Vasilevich Ostrogradski\n. While Andreev was on the faculty, he was joined by\nAleksandr Mikhailovich Lyapunov\nand\nVladimir Andreevich Steklov\nin\n1885\n.\nAndreev defended his Master's thesis\nOn a geometric formation of planar curves\nin February\n1875\nand, following a successful defence, he became an assistant professor at Kharkov. Towards the end of\n1876\nhe was granted leave to study abroad, and he spent most of\n1877\nand the first half of\n1878\nvisiting first Berlin but spending most of the eighteen months in Paris. While in Paris he worked on his doctoral thesis\n(\nequivalent to a British D.Sc.\n)\nwhich he published in Moscow after his return. He successfully defended the thesis in Moscow in February\n1879\nand as a result was promoted to extraordinary professor at Kharkov. Andreev took a leading role in the foundation and development of the\nKharkov Mathematical Society\n. This Society is one of the oldest mathematical societies and was founded in\n1879\n, the year Andreev became an extraordinary professor. He was elected to be the Society's first president. Following on from the work of his doctoral thesis, he published\nOn the formation of the polars in relation to plane geometrical curves\nin Kharkov in\n1880\n. In\n1884\nhe was elected to the\nRussian Academy of Sciences\nand in the same year attended a congress at La Rochelle in France, publishing the paper\nOn Poncelet polygons\nin the Proceedings. While at the congress he was elected a fellow of the Academy of Sciences at Bordeaux. Andreev became an ordinary professor at Kharkov in\n1886\nand, one year earlier he had become a professor at the Kharkov Technological Institute in the year of its foundation.\nIn October\n1898\nAndreev left Kharkov to take up an appointment at Moscow University where he was appointed to the chair of mathematics. He remained in Moscow for the rest of his career. He was dean of the Faculty of Physics and Mathematics from\n1905\nto\n1911\nand during these years introduced important new teaching structures into the Faculty. In\n1911\nhe became seriously ill with a tumour in his throat and this forced him to stop teaching. He travelled abroad in\n1913\nto have an operation on his throat and following this he was able to return to his teaching at Moscow until\n1917\nwhen again ill health forced him to give up. At this time he left Moscow and travelled to the Crimea where he spent his final few years. Some biographies claim that he died in Moscow but, although his wish had always been to die there, in fact he died close to the town of Sevastopol in the Crimea.\nAndreev is best known for his work on geometry, although he also made contributions to analysis. In the area of geometry he did major pieces of work on\nprojective geometry\n. Let us note one particular piece of work for which he has not received the credit he deserves. Gram\ndeterminants\nwere introduced by\nJ P Gram\nin\n1879\nbut Andreev invented them independently in the context of problems of expansion of functions into orthogonal series and the best quadratic approximation to functions.",
