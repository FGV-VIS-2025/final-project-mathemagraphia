  "biografia": "Edward McShane\nwas the son of Augustus McShane, a medical doctor. His mother was Harriet Kenner Butler, who had been a school teacher. After attending school in New Orleans, McShane entered Tulane University. There he studied mathematics and engineering, graduating in\n1925\nwith both Science and Engineering degrees.\nAfter completing his first degrees\n(\nfor he had two!\n)\n, McShane continued to study at Tulane for his Master's degree in mathematics while teaching mathematics as an instructor. It is noted in\n[\n2\n]\nthat he:-\n... once remarked that he had never regretted his decision to become a mathematician rather than an engineer.\nWith the award of a Master's degree from Tulane in\n1927\n, McShane went to the University of Chicago to undertake studies for his doctorate. However, financial difficulties caused him to interrupt his studies and take out the session\n1928\n-\n29\nwhen he taught at the University of Wichita to earn some money. Returning to Chicago, where his studies were supervised by\nBliss\n, he completed work on his thesis and he was awarded his PhD in\n1930\n.\nMcShane spent part of the following two years at Princeton, part at Ohio State, part at Harvard and part at Chicago. During this period he married Virginia Haun on\n10\nSeptember\n1931\n. They would have two daughters, Jennifer and Ginger, and one son, Neill, all of whom were highly talented in both music and mathematics.\nNow\n1932\nwas not a good year to be trying to find a university post in the United States due to the effects of the Depression. McShane and his wife spent the session\n1932\n-\n33\nat GÃ¶ttingen, but if\n1932\nwas a bad year in the United States,\n1933\nwas certainly a bad year in Germany with Hitler coming to power and bringing in his first anti-Jewish legislation. Having seen the frightening start of the Nazi rise to power, the McShane family returned to the United States where McShane spent the next two years at Princeton.\nIn\n1935\nMcShane was appointed to a professorship at the University of Virginia at Charlottesville, where, except for temporary appointments elsewhere, he was to remain for the rest of his life. One of these periods away was when he went to head the Ballistics Research Laboratory at the Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland in\n1942\n-\n45\nduring the Second World War. His joint treatise\nExterior Ballistics\nwritten during this period, and published in\n1953\n, was considered the leading work on ballistics at the time.\nIn\n[\n2\n]\na nice story is told regarding McShane during the McCarthy era. In the early\n1950\ns United States senator Joseph R McCarthy whipped up strong feelings against communism. McShane had been asked to complete a questionnaire. One question asked:-\n... whether he had ever been involved with organisations that had at any time advocated the violent overthrow of the U.S. government.\nIt was quite a brave move for McShane to reply \"yes\", because he was an employee of the State of Virginia! At the University of Virginia this sense of humour added to his popularity with both staff and graduate students who liked\n[\n2\n]\n:-\n... his clear lectures, his amusing anecdotes, and his willingness to think about their problems.\nMcShane is famous for his work in the\ncalculus of variations\n, Moore-Smith theory of limits, the theory of the integral, stochastic\ndifferential equations\n, and ballistics. In fact he wrote three important books on integration, the first being\nIntegration\nwritten in\n1944\nto provide a readable and clear introduction to\nLebesgue\nintegration for students. In\n1953\nhe wrote\nOrder preserving maps and integration processes\nwhich was\n[\n2\n]\n:-\n... an outgrowth of his search for a mathematically correct setting in which to treat the divergent integrals in\nquantum physics\n.\nIn\n1974\n, the year he retired and was made Professor Emeritus at Virginia, McShane published\nStochastic calculus and stochastic models\nwhich again reflected his work on the mathematical setting for quantum mechanics. Then in\n1983\nhe published his third book on integration,\nUnified integration\nwhich provides\n[\n2\n]\n:-\n... a theory of integrals with applications to physics.\nMcShane was much involved with both the\nAmerican Mathematical Society\nand with the\nMathematical Association of America\n. He was\nAmerican Mathematical Society\nColloquium Lecturer in\n1943\n, and later served the Society as President in\n1959\n-\n60\n. He also served as President of the\nMathematical Association of America\nin\n1953\n-\n54\n. Among the honours which he received was the Award for Distinguished Service to Mathematics from the\nMathematical Association of America\nin\n1964\n. Another honour is the fact that the paper\n[\n1\n]\nbelongs to a special volume of the\nSociety for Industrial and Applied Mathematics\nJournal on Control and Optimization\ndedicated to him.\nHe is described in\n[\n2\n]\nas:-\n... a deeply cultured man, with a flair for languages and a great variety of other interests. He was widely known for his warmth, generosity, and modesty, and for his fund of humorous and interesting anecdotes.",
