  "biografia": "Johannes Campanus\nwas chaplain to three popes, Pope Urban IV, Pope Nicholas IV and Pope Boniface VIII. In fact he knew Jacques PantelÃ©on, patriarch of Jerusalem\n1255\n-\n1261\n, during the years when he was patriarch. PantelÃ©on was elected pope on\n29\nAugust\n1261\n, becoming Pope Urban IV, and he made Campanus one of his chaplains He also made him Rector of the Church of Savines in the diocese of Arles in\n1263\nand gave him a canonicate in Toledo's cathedral in\n1264\n. Campanus also held other benefices being chaplain during\n1263\n-\n64\nto Ottobono Fieschi, the cardinal deacon of Saint Adrian's and papal legate to England. Fieschi was elected pope, becoming Pope Adrian V, on\n11\nJuly\n1276\nbut died less than five weeks later. Through Fieschi's influence, Campanus was made parson of Felmersham in Bedfordshire, England, some time before\n1268\n. Urban IV died on\n2\nOctober\n1264\nbut Campanus had other leading ecclesiastical figures as his patron so continued to be able to devote his time to scholarship.\nOne should not think that because Campanus held benefices in France, Spain and England, he must have travelled widely. In fact, although he may have visited these countries, there is no evidence that he did so. It was certainly common practice at this time for leading ecclesiastical figures to give benefices to support their friends who never went in person to the places where they held the benefices.\nRoger Bacon\n, writing in\n1267\n, stated that Campanus was one of the four greatest contemporary mathematicians but, despite some historians believing that\nBacon\nknew Campanus personally, this looks very unlikely. If Campanus did indeed visit Ottobono Fieschi while he was in England then a meeting with\nRoger Bacon\nwould be quite likely but, as we have just explained, this probably did not happen.\nCampanus later held a canonicate of Paris and served as papal chaplain to the two more popes, Nicholas IV\n(1288\n-\n92)\nand Boniface VIII\n(1294\n-\n1303)\n. He lived in the Augustinian Friars' convent at Viterbo for the last few years of his life and in his will he gave instructions for the construction of a chapel to St Anne in the Church of the Holy Trinity in Viterbo. Campanus wrote a Latin edition of\nEuclid\n's\nElements\nin\n15\nbooks around\n1260\nand it was the standard\nEuclid\nfor\n200\nyears. In an edition of this book published in\n1531\nhe is described as 'Magistro Campano' which may indicate that he taught in a university, but there is no other evidence to support this. The date we have given for his death is a guess. It is based on the fact that he drew up his will on\n9\nSeptember\n1296\nand on\n17\nSeptember\n1296\nPope Boniface VIII wrote a letter saying that Campanus had just died. His death must, therefore fall between these dates and we have simply taken the midpoint to minimise any error.\nMost of Campanus's writings were on astronomy. He wrote\nTheorica Planetarum\nwhich, since it is dedicated to Urban IV, must have been written between\n1261\nand\n1264\n. In this work Campanus describes the construction and use of an equatorium, the first to be described by a European. This instrument was basically a mechanical calculator to give the planetary motions. The instrument was made of disks whose rotation recreated the motion of a planet using\nPtolemy\n's deferent and epicycle description. As described by Campanus, the construction is not practical and it is unlikely that Campanus would have made an equatorium himself despite writing in his dedication to Urban IV that the instrument\n[\n2\n]\n:-\n... is a novelty among my discoveries, and furthermore I think it will please your greatness by the usefulness of its amusing approach.\nThe work also contains detailed descriptions of\nPtolemy\n's view of the universe giving the longitude of the planets as well as a geometrical description of the motion of the model. Campanus, using\nPtolemy\n's data, calculated the dimensions of the universe including a calculation of the area of the sphere of the fixed stars. Another astronomical work by Campanus is\nComputus maior\nwhich was a treatise on time-reckoning based on solar and lunar cycles. In this work, among many computational descriptions, he provided details of how to calculate the date of Easter. Campanus also wrote the important text\nTractatus de Sphaera\nwhich was an elementary astronomy book describing celestial phenomena seen during the\n24\nhour rotation of the heavens. He describes planetary motion in some detail, which is unusual for an elementary text at that time. Since the\nTractatus de Sphaera\nrefers to the\nTheorica Planetarum\nand the\nComputus maior\nit must have been written after these other two texts.\nOther astronomical work included a text on using a quadrant and a text on using an astrolabe. Campanus also published his own set of astronomical tables. Data for the planets was taken from the\nAlmagest\nâ\n(\nThe major thesis: from the Arabic 'al-majisti' -- the Arabic translation of the Greek 'Mathematike Syntaxis' later translated into Latin as 'Magna Syntaxis'\n)\nand from the Toledan Tables edited by the Arabian astronomer Azarquiel in\n1080\n, based on his own work and that of\nal-Khwarizmi\nand\nal-Battani\n. Campanus determined the time of each planet's retrograde motion and gave precise instructions on using the tables. He also made calculations in great detail of the distances to the planets and their sizes. In\n[\n9\n]\nKatherine Tredwell gives this summary of Campanus's astronomical contribution:-\nAs an astronomer, Campanus was not innovative in the modern sense. His importance lies rather in his ability to understand and utilise the recently rediscovered astronomy of the ancients. ... his works helped to establish the foundation on which later generations of astronomers would build their critical re-examination of\nPtolemy\n.\nLet us now look a bit further at Campanus's mathematical contributions. Most significant of these is his Latin edition of\nEuclid\n's\nElements\nwhich we have already mentioned above. We have given the date of this work as\n1260\nand this was worked out by\nCharles Sanders Peirce\n(\nsee\n[\n15\n]\n)\nfrom the fact that the manuscript text owned by Jacques PantelÃ©on while still patriarch of Jerusalem is still extant. Peirce writes\n[\n15\n]\n:-\n... we have in the commentary by Campanus, considering its respectable strength, occasionally its remarkable strength, additional evidence of the promising beginning of science which was made in the thirteenth century ...\nThe edition by Campanus relied to some extent on\nAdelard of Bath\n's Latin translations of\nEuclid\n's\nElements\nfrom Arabic sources. Another Latin\nEuclid\nby Robert of Chester was a compilation of writings by commentators on\nEuclid\nand did not contain a translation of the text as such. Campanus, however, borrowed most of his definitions, axioms, postulates and enunciations from this work by Robert of Chester. However, in Book VII, Campanus added definitions, postulates and axioms which he took from\nDe elementis arithmeticae artis\nby\nJordanus Nemorarius\n. Campanus shows that he is familiar with the work of Arab mathematicians and, in Book V, he quotes from\nGherard of Cremona\n's Latin translation of\nAhmed ibn Yusuf\n's treatise on ratio and proportion. In\n1485\nCampanus's\nEuclid\nbecame the first printed edition of\nEuclid\n's\nElements\nwhen it appeared in Venice, and it was in fact the first printed mathematical book of any importance. Between its first printing in\n1485\nand\n1560\nfourteen editions of Campanus's text were printed.\nTwo further mathematical texts are thought with a high degree of certainty to be by Campanus, although a slight doubt remains. These are\nDe figura sectore\nand\nDe proportione\nwhich clearly form two parts of a whole and are based on the work\nDe figura\nby\nThabit ibn Qurra\n. We explained above that Campanus borrowed material from\nDe elementis arithmeticae artis\nby\nJordanus Nemorarius\n. It is fair to note that he also added to the work, for he produced a manuscript which contains three additional propositions. Other mathematical work has been attributed to Campanus, but for most the attribution must be considered rather speculative.\nFinally we should mentions Campanus's contributions to astrology. His contribution here was a major one and most people today who have heard of Campanus know of him because of his 'house system' of dividing the horoscope into twelve houses. In fact it was almost certainly his reputation as an astrologer which led to his being chaplain to three popes. Certainly Urban IV made Campanus his chaplain so that he could advise him on astrological and medical matters. Much of his astrological knowledge came from the treatises written in Arabic by\nibn Ezra\naround the middle of the\n12\nth\ncentury. However, Campanus used his mathematical skills to develop his 'house system' which is still used by astrologers today. Campanus's house system provided a method of determining a plane through the celestial sphere which could be used to make twelve equal divisions called houses. The plane he chose was the prime vertical, that is the plane through the zenith intersecting the horizon at its east and west points.\nToomer writes\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nCampanus was a writer of considerable influence. His\nEuclid\nwas almost the canonical version until the sixteenth century, when it was gradually superseded by translations made directly from the Greek. The continuing popularity of his 'Computus' and 'Sphere' is attested by their being printed several times in the sixteenth century. The 'Theorica' was never printed, probably because, unlike the others, it was not a popular work but a technical one that would appeal only to those with a professional interest. It was none the less influential: this is shown both by the large number of surviving manuscripts and by the references to it in astronomical works of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.\nNote that although the\nTheorica\nhad not been printed when Toomer wrote these words, shortly after this he, along with F S Benjamin, edited and published the work, see\n[\n2\n]\n.",
