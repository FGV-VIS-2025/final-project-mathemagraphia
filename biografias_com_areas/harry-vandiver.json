  "biografia": "Harry Vandiver\n's parents were John Lyon Vandiver and Ida Frances Everett. Harry developed an antagonism towards public education and left Central High School at an early age to work as a customshouse broker for his father's firm.\nD H Lehmer\nwrites\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nHe was self-taught in his youth and must have had little patience with secondary education since he never graduated from high school. This impatience, especially with mathematical education, was to last the rest of his life.\nWhen he was eighteen years old he began to solve many of the number theory problems which were posed in the\nAmerican Mathematical Monthly\n, regularly submitting solutions. In addition to solving problems, he began to pose problems himself. By\n1902\nhe was contributing papers to the Monthly. For example he published two short papers in\n1902\nA Problem Connected with Mersenne's Numbers\nand\nApplications of a Theorem Regarding Circulants\n.\nIn\n1904\nhe collaborated with\nBirkhoff\non a paper on the prime factors of\na\nn\nâ\nb\nn\na^{n} - b^{n}\na\nn\nâ\nb\nn\npublished in the\nAnnals of Mathematics\n. In fact the result they proved was not new, although they were not aware of the earlier work which had been published by A S Bang in\n1886\n. Also in the year\n1904\n, Vandiver published\nOn Some Special Arithmetic Congruences\nin the\nAmerican Mathematical Monthly\nand, although still working as an agent for his father's firm, he did attend some graduate lectures at the University of Pennsylvania. He also began reading papers on algebraic number theory and embarked on a study of the work of\nKummer\n, in particular his contributions to solving\nFermat's Last Theorem\n. Over the next few years he published papers such as\nTheory of finite algebras\n(1912)\n,\nNote on Fermat's last theorem\n(1914)\n, and\nSymmetric functions formed by systems of elements of a finite algebra and their connection with Fermat's quotient and Bernoulli's numbers\n(1917)\n.\nThe outbreak of World War I in\n1914\ndid not directly affect the United States since the Democratic president Woodrow Wilson made a declaration of neutrality. This policy was controversial but popular enough to see him re-elected in\n1916\n. However US shipping was being disrupted\n(\nand sunk\n)\nby German submarines and, under pressure from Republicans, Wilson declared war on Germany on\n6\nApril\n1917\n. Vandiver joined the United States Naval Reserve and continued to serve until\n1919\nwhen the war had ended. After leaving the Naval Reserve,\nBirkhoff\npersuaded Vandiver to become a professional mathematician and to accept a post at Cornell University in\n1919\n. Despite having no formal qualifications, his excellent publication record clearly showed his high quality and he was appointed as an instructor. He also worked during the summer with\nDickson\nat Chicago on his classic treatise\nHistory of the Theory of Numbers\n. In\n1924\nhe moved to the University of Texas where he was appointed as an Associate Professor. He spent the rest of his career at the University of Texas, being promoted to full professor in\n1925\n, then named as distinguished professor of applied mathematics and astronomy in\n1947\n. He continued in this role until he retired in\n1966\nat the age of\n84\n.\nVandiver was awarded the\nCole\nPrize in Number Theory by the\nAmerican Mathematical Society\nin\n1931\n:-\n... for his several papers on\nFermat\n's last theorem published in the Transactions of the American Mathematical Society and in the Annals of Mathematics during the preceding five years, with special reference to a paper entitled \"On Fermat's last theorem\".\nIn particular the paper entitled\nOn Fermat's last theorem\nwhich was specially mentioned, was published in the\nTransactions of the American Mathematical Society\nin\n1929\n.\nHis publication record was extraordinary containing\n174\nitems throughout his career. Let us mention a few more of his early papers:\nThe generalized Lagrange indeterminate congruence for a composite ideal modulus\n(1917)\n;\nA property of cyclotomic integers and its relation to Fermat's last theorem\n(1919)\n;\nA new type of criteria for the first case of Fermat's last theorem\n(1924)\n; and\nA property of cyclotomic integers and its relation to Fermat's last theorem\n(1925)\n. He continued to work on extending\nKummer\n's methods to show that the theorem was true for increasingly large exponents. With hand calculations he, with help from his students, had shown the result to be true for all\nn\nn\nn\nup to\n600\n. In\n1952\nhe was able to implements his methods on early computers at the National Bureau of Standards Institute at Los Angeles and was able to prove the theorem true for all primes less than\n2000\n. It is his life-long work on\nFermat\n's Last Theorem for which he is best known, but Vandiver also wrote papers on cyclotomic fields,\nBernoulli numbers\n, the reciprocity laws, finite fields, techniques for factorisation, semigroups, semirings, and algebras. A conjecture, now known as 'Vandiver's conjecture', concerning the class group of cyclotomic fields was so named since Vandiver frequently posed it. He was not, however, the first to make the conjecture which should really be named '\nKummer\n's conjecture' since it first appears in\n1849\nin a letter which\nKummer\nwrote to\nKronecker\n.\nAlthough the\nCole\nPrize might be considered Vandiver's greatest distinction, we should also mention that he was vice-president of the\nAmerican Mathematical Society\nin\n1934\n-\n35\nand was the Colloquium Lecturer at Ann Arbor in\n1935\nwhen he lectured on\nFermat\n's Last Theorem. He was also honoured with election to the\nNational Academy of Sciences\nin\n1934\nand he was given an honorary degree by the University of Pennsylvania in\n1946\n.\nVandiver married Maude Folmsbee in\n1923\n; they had one son, Frank Vandiver, who became president of Texas A&M. It is worth noting that Vandiver continued to hold strong views against public education and Frank was privately tutored to first degree level without attending high school or university. Vandiver never owned a house and lived with his wife in the Alamo Hotel in Austin where he had a large collection of classical recordings.\nD H Lehmer\nwrites\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nVandiver's best method of communicating ideas was that of personal face to face discussion; he was a poor lecturer. In these discussions he conveyed not only the mathematical ideas, but also his ideas about mathematics. These were often strong and well put and reminded one of his contemporary,\nE T Bell\n. During such a session it was not unusual to have him inject his opinions about other topics such as baseball and Mozart. He was a man of many parts with a great mind of his own.",
