  "biografia": "Hermann Arthur Jahn\n's parents were Friedrich Wilhelm Hermann Jahn and Marion May Curtiss. Friedrich Jahn was born in Germany but emigrated to England in\n1890\nwhere he married Marion May Curtiss\n(\nborn\n4\nMay\n1876\nin Gainsbrough\n)\nin Gainsborough, Lincolnshire, in October\n1897\n. Their children were Hermann Edgar Jahn\n(\nborn\n1900)\n, Roland Alfred Jahn\n(\nborn\n1905)\n, Hermann Arthur Jahn\n(\nthe subject of this biography\n)\n, and Elfrida Marion Jahn\n(\nborn\n1910)\n. Hermann Jahn was born in Colchester but spent his youth in Lincoln. He attended the City School, Lincoln, founded\n1896\nin Monks Road\n(\nthe premises are now used by Lincoln College\n)\n. This school became the Municipal Technical Day School when the city became a Local Education Authority in\n1903\n.\nSometimes when writing these biographies we discover information which we do not quite understand. One such relates to Marion May Jahn and we record it here. On\n13\nAugust\n1915\nthe Home Office issued her a Naturalisation Certificate. She is described as a resident of Lincoln being re-admitted from Germany. We can find no information relating to any other members of the family travelling back to Lincoln from Germany at this time.\nAfter leaving the City School in\n1925\n, Jahn entered University College, London where he read chemistry. He was awarded a B.Sc. in chemistry in\n1928\nand then a Master's degree for his thesis\nViscosity of mixtures of gases of identical molecular weight\n. Excited by the recent remarkable results in quantum theory, he then went to Leipzig where his doctoral studies were supervised by\nWerner Heisenberg\nand, after he was appointed to Leipzig in\n1931\n, by\nBartel van der Waerden\n. Jahn received his doctorate for his thesis\nRotation und Schwingung des MethanmolekÃ¼ls\n(\nThe rotation and oscillation of the methane molecule\n)\n. He received his doctorate on\n14\nFebruary\n1935\nand was appointed to a position in the Davy-\nFaraday\nLaboratory of the Royal Institution in Albermarle Street, London. There he continued with the research that he had done for his doctoral thesis\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nHis Ph.D. work on the vibrations of the methane molecule was published in the 'Annalen der Physik'\n(1935)\n, was extended to the acetylene molecule\n(1936)\n, the absorption spectrum of methane\n(1937)\nand culminated in two\nRoyal Society\npapers\n(\nthe first with Edward Teller\n)\non the stability of polyatomic molecules in degenerate electronic states\n(1937\n/\n38)\n. This was the Jahn-Teller effect dating from ... round about the year\n1935\nwhen Teller was also in London. This work was immediately recognised as being very important, and Jahn's name along with Teller's became enshrined in the literature.\nThe two\nRoyal Society of London\npapers referred to in this quote are\n(\nwith Edward Teller\n)\nStability of Polyatomic Molecules in Degenerate Electronic States. I. Orbital Degeneracy\n, and the single authored paper\nStability of polyatomic molecules in degenerate electronic states. II. Spin degeneracy\n. In the first of these the authors note:-\nThis research was carried out when the authors were working in the Sir William Ramsay Laboratories of Inorganic and Physical Chemistry, University College, London.\nThey begin their Introduction by writing:-\nIn the following we investigate the conditions under which a polyatomic molecule can have a stable equilibrium configuration when its electronic state has orbital degeneracy, i.e. degeneracy not arising from the spin. We shall show that stability and degeneracy are not possible simultaneously unless the molecule is a linear one, i.e. unless all the nuclei in the equilibrium configuration lie on a straight line. We shall see also that the instability is only slight if the degeneracy is due solely to electrons having no great influence on the binding of the molecule.\nThe proof of their results is based on using group theory. Similarly, the second of these papers, with Jahn as the only author, uses irreducible representations of symmetric groups in the proof of the results. He changed topics around\n1940\nand began studying scattering of X-rays.\nDuring the Second World War, Jahn worked at the Royal Aircraft Establishment where the work was primarily on aircraft engine problems. Jahn, who was an expert on vibrations in molecules, now worked on vibrational problems in aircraft. In particular he looked at how to avoid flutter in wings and aerofoils of aircraft. He wrote a number of reports\n(\njointly with Gurney Harry Lionel Buxton\n(1876\n-\n1962))\nsuch as\nComparative calculations of the critical speed for flexural-torsion flutter of a typical cantilever wing\n(1942)\n, and\nNote on the possibility of antisymmetric elevator flutter on the Typhoon\n(1943)\n. Also with\nGeorge Temple\nhe wrote\nFlutter at supersonic speeds\n.\nJahn was employed at the Royal Aircraft Establishment from\n1941\nto\n1946\n. During these years he married Lily SchÃ¼ler\n(1910\n-\n2000)\n. She had been born in Frankfurt in Germany into a Jewish family and had trained as a primary school teacher. However, when the Nazis came to power in\n1933\n, since she was Jewish, she was dismissed from her teaching post. She went to Leipzig where she taught part-time in a Jewish elementary school. She met Jahn when he was studying for his doctorate in Leipzig. She escaped from Germany and immigrated to England where she worked first as a housemaid. She then got a teaching position in Wembley and, in\n1943\n, she married Jahn. They had two children, Michael\n(\nborn\n1944)\nand Margaret\n(\nborn\n1946)\n.\nJahn then spent the two years\n1946\n-\n48\nworking in the Department of Mathematical Physics in the University of Birmingham. While there he published\nImprovement of an approximate set of latent roots and modal columns of a matrix by methods akin to those of classical perturbation theory\n(1948)\n. He gave the following abstract:-\nA method is described for simultaneously improving all the latent roots and modal columns of a given matrix, starting from a given complete set of approximate modal columns. It is considered that the method will be useful as a final step in any iteration process of determining these quantities. The method is illustrated by a numerical example. The modification needed when two or more of the latent roots are coincident, or nearly so, is very briefly indicated. The fundamental formulae are akin to those of classical perturbation theory, the corresponding formulae of which, for the special case of a\nLagrange\nfrequency equation, are given for convenience in the Appendix.\nIn\n1947\nJahn considered working for the Atomic Energy Research Establishment situated near Harwell. This had only recently been established\n(\nJanuary\n1946)\non the site of RAF Harwell, south of Oxford, when scientists moved into the accommodation that the RAF had used up to that time\n[\n2\n]\n:-\n[\nJahn\n]\nwas interviewed by\nKlaus Fuchs\n, Head of Theoretical Physics at Harwell, in the hope of possibly obtaining a position there in\n1947\n. But Jahn was a realist. \"I suppose I may not be able to get a post here\", he remarked, \"because of my German ancestry\". \"Why not?\" said\nFuchs\n, \"Look at me. I have access to the classified material, and I have German ancestry.\" The irony of the conversation transpired only later.\nThe Jahn-\nFuchs\nconnection was that\nKlaus Fuchs\nhad worked for\nRudolf Peierls\n(1907\n-\n1995)\nduring World War II on the development of atomic weapons, both in the UK and in the United States.\nPeierls\nwas head of the Department of Mathematical Physics in the University of Birmingham where Jahn was working at the time he went to be interviewed by\nFuchs\n. The 'irony' referred to in the above quote is that in January\n1950\nFuchs\nconfessed to supplying information from the American, British and Canadian Manhattan Project to the Soviet Union. Jahn did not take a job at the Atomic Energy Research Establishment but, in\n1948\n, was appointed to the first Chair in Applied Mathematics at University College, Southampton.\nAt Southampton one of Jahn's first research students was James Philip Elliott\n(1929\n-\n2008)\n. Elliott had been an undergraduate at University College, Southampton, graduating with a mathematics degree in\n1949\n. He then went on to study for a Ph.D. at Southampton advised by Jahn. He graduated with his doctorate in\n1951\n. Jahn and Elliott explored the application of Racah's tensor operator techniques to nuclear structure and applied group theoretic techniques to the understanding of atomic nuclei. Let us note that Elliott continued to work in this area for the rest of his career and he was elected a Fellow of the\nRoyal Society of London\nin\n1980\n. He was awarded both the Rutherford Medal and the Rutherford Prize by the Institute of Physics in\n1994\n, and also awarded the Lise Meitner Prize of the European Physical Society in\n2002\n. Jahn also continued to work in this areas of the rest of his career\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nHe contributed to about\n10\npapers in this area in the decade from\n1950\nto\n1960\n. In these he stressed the importance of applying group theoretic techniques to nuclear structure problems, discovered some important symmetry properties of the coupling coefficients of angular momentum theory, and did more than anyone else to keep alive the connection between the symmetric group and the continuous groups which is made explicit through the use of Young operators\n[\nnamed after\nAlfred Young\n]\n. In addition he initiated the use of computers in the calculation and tabulation of coupling coefficients in rational form. In a different area he advocated the application of Morpurgo differential equations to nuclear physics problems many years before such a programme was developed in France and the U.S.S.R. Rather more algebraic topics dominated the last years of his life. In an effort to improve the available algorithms for constructing symmetrised state functions he continued to do work on the symmetric group until the time of his terminal illness.\nPeter Theodore Landsberg, who was Jahn's successor to his chair of Applied Mathematics in Southampton, writes\n[4]\n:-\nThroughout his time at Southampton he gave inestimable help to students and colleagues alike, and taught always the virtues of patient persevering research. He and his wife, Lily, entertained generously and thus provided a focus for a rapidly growing Mathematics Department of what became the University of Southampton in the\n1950\ns. Jahn\n[\nwas\n]\na first-rate mathematical physicist who made significant contributions to the theory of vibrations in molecules, solids and nuclei, and whose work is widely appreciated. Behind it all was a meticulously careful but humorous and kind scientist. ... Jahn, who died ... after a nine-months illness, bravely borne, was modest to a fault and hence not easy to know. But it was worth a little effort to penetrate this reserve, for one would soon be rewarded.",
