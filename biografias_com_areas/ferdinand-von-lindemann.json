  "biografia": "Ferdinand von Lindemann\n's father, also named Ferdinand Lindemann, was a modern language teacher at the\nGymnasium\nin Hannover at the time of his birth. His mother was Emilie Crusius, the daughter of the headmaster of the Gymnasium. When Ferdinand\n(\nthe subject of this biography\n)\nwas two years old his father was appointed as director of a gasworks in Schwerin. The family moved to that town where Ferdinand spent his childhood years and he attended school in Schwerin.\nAs was the standard practice of students in Germany in the second half of the\n19\nth\ncentury, Lindemann moved from one university to another. He began his studies in GÃ¶ttingen in\n1870\nand there he was much influenced by\nClebsch\n. He was fortunate to be taught by\nClebsch\nfor he had only been appointed to GÃ¶ttingen in\n1868\nand sadly he died in\n1872\n. Later Lindemann was able to make use of the lecture notes he had taken attending\nClebsch\n's geometry lectures when he edited and revised these note for publication in\n1876\n.\nLindemann also studied at Erlangen and at Munich. At Erlangen he studied for his doctorate and, under\nKlein\n's direction, he wrote a dissertation on\nnon-Euclidean\nline geometry and its connection with non-Euclidean kinematics and statics. The degree was awarded in\n1873\nfor the dissertation\nÃber unendlich kleine Bewegungen und Ã¼ber Kraftsysteme bei allgemeiner projektivischer Massbestimmung\nâ\n(\nOn the infinitesimal movements and power systems in general projective determination of mass\n)\n.\nAfter the award of his doctorate Lindemann set off to visit important mathematical centres in England and France. In England he made visits to Oxford, Cambridge and London, while in France he spent time at Paris where he was influenced by\nChasles\n,\nBertrand\n,\nJordan\nand\nHermite\n. Returning to Germany Lindemann worked for his\nhabilitation\n. This was awarded by the University of WÃ¼rzburg in\n1877\nand later that year he was appointed as extraordinary professor at the University of Freiburg. He was promoted to ordinary professor at Freiburg in\n1879\n.\nLindemann became professor at the University of KÃ¶nigsberg in\n1883\n.\nHurwitz\nand\nHilbert\nboth joined the staff at KÃ¶nigsberg while he was there. While in KÃ¶nigsberg he married Elizabeth KÃ¼ssner, an actress, and daughter of a local school teacher. In\n1893\nLindemann accepted a chair at the University of Munich where he was to remain for the rest of his career.\nLindemann's main work was in geometry and analysis. He is famed for his proof that Ï is\ntranscendental\n, that is, Ï is not the root of any algebraic equation with\nrational\ncoefficients. The problem of\nsquaring the circle\n, namely constructing a square with the same area as a given circle using\nruler and compasses\nalone, had been one of the classical problems of Greek mathematics. In\n1873\n, the year in which Lindemann was awarded his doctorate,\nHermite\npublished his proof that\ne\ne\ne\nis transcendental. Shortly after this Lindemann visited\nHermite\nin Paris and discussed the methods which he had used in his proof. Using methods similar to those of\nHermite\n, Lindemann established in\n1882\nthat Ï was also transcendental.\nIn fact his proof is based on the proof that\ne\ne\ne\nis transcendental together with the fact that\ne\ni\nÏ\n=\nâ\n1\ne^{i\\pi} = -1\ne\ni\nÏ\n=\nâ\n1\n. Many historians of science regret that\nHermite\n, despite doing most of the hard work, failed to make the final step to prove the result concerning which would have brought him fame outside the world of mathematics. This fame was instead heaped on Lindemann but many feel that he was a mathematician clearly inferior to\nHermite\nwho, by good luck, stumbled on a famous result. Although there is some truth in this, it is still true that many people make their own luck and in Lindemann's case one has to give him much credit for spotting the trick which\nHermite\nhad failed to see.\nLambert\nhad proved in\n1761\nthat Ï was irrational but this was not enough to prove the impossibility of squaring the circle with ruler and compass since certain\nalgebraic numbers\ncan be constructed with ruler and compass. Lindemann's proof that Ï is transcendental finally established that squaring the circle with ruler and compasses is insoluble. He published his proof in the paper\nÃber die Ludolphsehe Zahl\nâ\n(\nOn the Ludolphine number\n(\ni.e. Ï\n)\n)\nin\n1882\n.\nPhysics was also an area of interest for Lindemann. He worked on the theory of the electron, and came into conflict with\nArnold Sommerfeld\non this subject. Eckert, in\n[\n4\n]\n, looks at Lindemann's contributions to physics, using manuscript materials, including correspondence with\nSommerfeld\n.\nAnother research interest of Lindemann was the history of mathematics. He also undertook, in collaboration with his wife, translating work. In particular they translated and revised some of\nPoincarÃ©\n's writings.\nLindemann was elected to the Bavarian Academy of Sciences in\n1894\nas an associate member, becoming a full member in the following year. He given an honorary degree by the University of St Andrews in\n1912\n.\nWussing\nwrites in\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nLindemann was one of the founders of the modern German educational system. He emphasised the development of the seminar and in his lectures communicated the latest research results. He also supervised more than sixty doctoral students, including\nDavid Hilbert\n.\nHilbert\nwas Lindemann's doctoral student in KÃ¶nigsberg. Another of his doctoral students was\nOskar Perron\nwho studied under him in Munich.",
