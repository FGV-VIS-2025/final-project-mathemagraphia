  "biografia": "Hyman Bass\n's parents were immigrants to the United States from Lithuania. They had a large family with Hyman being the seventh of his parents eight children. It consisted of four girls, including Madeleine and Sylvia, all older than Hyman, and four boys, Leon and Manuel being older than Hyman, with Isaac the youngest in the family. Hyman Bass writes\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nI absorbed little family cultural influence during my childhood, apart from my father's orthodox Judaism, and the heated family discussions of national and world politics.\nHyman was only seven years old when World War II began, and nine years old when the United States entered the war after Japanese aircraft attacked the US fleet at Pearl Harbour on\n7\nDecember\n1941\n. His older brothers and sisters were old enough to serve in the war and this was to have a major influence on Hyman. In particular his brother Manuel took part in the V\n12\nofficers training programme. He\n[\n1\n]\n:-\n... came home on leave speaking excitedly to me and my younger brother Isaac about the science courses he was taking. It was these conversations that first awakened my awareness of and interest in science.\nAfter World War II ended, Leon and Manuel ended their war service and began studying at the California Institute of Technology. The family, including Hyman, moved to Los Angeles at this time. When the time was approaching for Bass to begin university studies he asked his brother Manuel for advice. In particular, although he was very interested by science, he wanted to study at a liberal arts college and Manuel suggested that Princeton would be the best place. Bass won a scholarship to enable him to attend, then entered Princeton thinking that he would probably major in physics.\nOne of the courses in which Bass enrolled in his first year of study was a calculus course lectured by\nEmil Artin\nand tutored by\nSerge Lang\nand\nJohn Tate\n. It was to completely change the direction of Bass's interests\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nThis was a rigorous course in analysis, with everything proved. More than that,\nArtin\n's lectures, which were like pieces of theatre, made you understand the crux of a proof, the moments where some essential new idea or invention makes its appearance. ... I had no reason to believe that this course was substantially different from any other college calculus course. I later learned otherwise, not only because of its remarkable teaching staff, but also for the students then enrolled. Our class included several students who later became prominent mathematicians ...\nBass graduated from Princeton with a B.A. in\n1955\nand then went to the University of Chicago as an NSF graduate fellow to study for his Masters Degree. Although he found Chicago very different from Princeton, nevertheless it was \"again an environment that lived and breathed mathematics.\"\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nKaplansky\ngave an inspiring series of courses on homological methods in commutative algebra. Faithful to his expository style,\nKaplansky\naimed not to lead us deeply into the whole forest, but rather to show us a few magnificent trees. He would target a few central theorems, and then track a logical geodesic to them, using the greatest economy of means, eschewing any avoidable extrinsic machinery. These lectures, attended by both students and young faculty, initiated a generation of Chicago students, myself included, into this new and blossoming field.\nInspired by\nIrving Kaplansky\n, after the award of an M.S. in\n1956\n, Bass undertook work for his doctorate under his supervision. He published his first mathematics paper\nFinite monadic algebras\nin\n1958\n. The idea of a \"monadic algebra\" had been introduced by\nPaul Halmos\n, who was on the faculty in Chicago at this time, in a paper in\n1956\n.\nHalmos\ndefined such algebras as Boolean algebras with a distributive closure operation, in which the complement of any closed element is closed. Bass gave explicit descriptions of the finite monadic algebras in his first paper, showing they were in one-one correspondence to finite sets of positive integers.\nHe examined refinements of the notions of homological dimension in his doctoral thesis\nGlobal Dimensions of Rings\nand he received his Ph.D. from the University of Chicago for this thesis in August\n1959\n. The natural route for Bass to take at this stage would have been to take up a fellowship at the Institute for Advanced Study and concentrate solely on research. However\nSamuel Eilenberg\nwas at Columbia University in Morningside Heights, Manhattan, New York and he persuaded Bass to take a teaching job there. Bass writes in\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nSince great teachers had been much of my mathematical inspiration, I looked forward to teaching, so it was not a hard sell.\nAppointed as\nRitt\nInstructor at Columbia\n[\n1\n]\n:-\n... there was no one directly engaged with the kind of mathematics I had been thinking about. So I tried to learn what others were doing, attending many of the graduate courses: number theory and\nalgebraic geometry\nfrom\nLang\n,\nLie\ngroups and class field theory from\nHarish-Chandra\n, differential algebra from\nKolchin\n, category theory from\nEilenberg\n, and fiber bundles from Albrecht Dold.\nBass produced a series of papers during his first years at Columbia, for example\nFinitistic dimension and a homological generalization of semiprimary  rings\n(1960)\n,\nProjective modules over algebras\n(1961)\n,\nInjective dimension in noetherian rings\n(1962)\n, and\nTorsion free and projective modules\n(1962)\n. The paper\nThe homotopy theory of projective modules\n(1962)\nwas written jointly with S Schanuel. The authors write:-\nSerre\nhas established the rudiments of a dictionary for translating the language of projective modules into that of vector bundles. With this point of departure we have attempted to adapt some of the results and methods of homotopy theory to certain purely arithmetic and even noncommutative settings. Detailed proofs of our results will appear elsewhere.\nBass spent the year\n1963\n-\n64\nas an NSF Postdoctoral Fellow at the College de France. An outcome of this year was the paper\nSous-groupes d'indice fini dans\nS\nL\n(\nn\n,\nZ\n)\nSL(n, \\mathbb{Z})\nS\nL\n(\nn\n,\nZ\n)\n(\npublished in\n1964)\nwritten jointly with\nJ-P Serre\nand M Lazard. Returning to Columbia University, he was promoted to Assistant Professor in\n1963\n.\nColumbia University came into existence in\n1912\nbut Columbia College had existed for well over\n100\nyears before that. Columbia College only educated men\n(\nup to\n1983)\n, but it was affiliated to Barnard College for women from its foundation in\n1889\n. Bass served as Associate Professor and Chair at Barnard during\n1964\n-\n65\n. From\n1964\nto\n1966\nhe was also a Sloan Fellow. He was promoted to Professor of Mathematics at Columbia in\n1965\n, a position he held until\n1992\nwhen he was named\nAdrain\nProfessor. During his period as professor, Bass was a Guggenheim Fellow at the Institut des Hautes Ãtudes Scientifiques in Paris during the year\n1968\n-\n69\n, then served as Chair of the Department of Mathematics at Columbia University from\n1975\nto\n1979\n.\nWe have mentioned some areas of Bass's work above, but let us note that he himself gives his research interests as algebraic K-theory; number theory; group theory\n(\ngeometric methods\n)\n; and algebraic geometry. To many people, Bass is best known for his classic text\nAlgebraic K-theory\npublished in\n1968\n. A Heller, in a review of the book, writes:-\nAlgebraic K-theory flows from two sources. The\n(\nJ H C\n)\nWhitehead\ntorsion, introduced in order to study the topological notion of simple homotopy type, leads to the groups\nK\n1\nK_{1}\nK\n1\nâ\n. The\nGrothendieck\ngroup of projective modules over a ring leads to\nK\n0\nK_{0}\nK\n0\nâ\n. The latter notion was applied by\nAtiyah\nand\nHirzebruch\nin order to construct a new\ncohomology theory\nwhich has been enormously fruitful in topology. The observation that these two ideas could be unified in a beautiful and powerful theory with widespread applications in algebra is due to the author, who is also responsible for a major portion of those applications. The author of this book is thus uniquely qualified to produce a fundamental document in this new and expanding field; he has also produced an admirable exposition of its methods and results.\nFor this outstanding book Bass was awarded the\nVan Amringe\nPrize from Columbia University in the year following its publication. In\n[\n2\n]\nBass recounts his contributions in this area. He writes:-\nThese informal reminiscences, presented at the ICTP\n2002\nConference on algebraic K-theory, recount the trajectory in the author's early research, from work on the\nSerre\nconjecture\n(\non projective modules over polynomial algebras\n)\n, via ideas from algebraic geometry and topology, to the ideas and constructions that eventually contributed to the founding of algebraic K-theory. The solution of the congruence subgroup problem is presented as a pivotal event.\nHe has received many other honours and prizes, in addition to that for\nAlgebraic K-theory\n, such as the\nCole\nPrize in Algebra from the\nAmerican Mathematical Society\nin\n1975\n. He was elected to the\nAmerican Academy of Arts and Sciences\nin\n1980\n, the\nNational Academy of Sciences\nin\n1982\n, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science in\n1986\nserving as Chairman of Section A during\n1987\n-\n1988\nand\n1997\n-\n1998\n.\nBass has visited many leading institutions around the world, spending varying periods of time. For example he was a visiting professor at the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico in the summer of\n1965\n. He was first a visiting professor at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research in Bombay, India, in the winter of\n1965\n-\n66\n. There he gave the course\nTopics in Algebraic K-theory\nwhich was published in\nLecture notes, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research\n(\nBombay,\n1966)\n. Further visits to the Tata Institute took place in the summer of\n1969\n, the summer of\n1976\n, the autumn of\n1979\n, the autumn of\n1990\n, and the summer of\n1995\n. Other examples of such visits are Trinity College, University of Cambridge, England for a term in\n1973\n, the Instituto de Matematica Pura e Applicada, Rio de Janeiro, in the summer of\n1977\n, the University of Utah, Salt Lake City, in the autumn in\n1977\n, then the University of California, Berkeley, in the winter of\n1977\n-\n78\n. Over the years he has, as one would expect, spent several periods as a visiting member of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton; in the summer of\n1964\n, the academic year\n1965\n-\n66\n, the summer of\n1975\n, and the summer of\n1979\n.\nAlthough Bass was interested in mathematical education throughout his career, this interest took a different turn in\n1991\nwhen he was invited to join the Mathematical Sciences Education Board at the\nNational Academy of Sciences\n. His description of the relation between mathematicians and educators given in\n[\n1\n]\nis well worth quoting:-\nMathematicians tend to think of educational matters almost exclusively in terms of content; what material should be taught. They thus approach teachers and educators in the guise of experts with the answers in hand, ready to contribute their authorative advice. They often convey disdain\n(\neven if unintended\n)\nto the teachers and educators with whom they speak, and inspire defensiveness and resentment in return. One result of this history is that the important conversations that now need to take place between mathematicians and educators are burdened with suspicion and cultural prejudices.\nHe has written many papers on mathematical education such as\nEducation reform from a national perspective: the mathematics community's investment and future\n(1994)\n,\nMathematicians as educators\n(1997)\n,\nMathematicians and the national eighth grade test\n(1997)\n, and\nMathematicians and the National Eighth-Grade Test\n(1998)\n. All these articles were published in the\nNotices of the American Mathematical Society\n. He has also published many articles jointly with Deborah L Ball, an educational researcher and elementary school teacher. Examples of such articles are\nInterweaving content and pedagogy in teaching and learning to teach:  Knowing and using mathematics\n(2000)\n,\nMaking believe:  The collective construction of public mathematical knowledge in the elementary classroom\n(2000)\n,\nMaking mathematics reasonable in school\n(2003)\n,\nA practice-based theory of mathematical knowledge for teaching:  The case of mathematical reasoning\n(2003)\n, and\nKnowing mathematics for teaching\n(2003)\n.\nFinally we mention that Bass has served the\nAmerican Mathematical Society\nin many roles. For example he served as Vice President in\n1980\n-\n81\n, Chair of the Committee on Education from\n1995\nto\n2000\n, and President from\n2001\nto\n2003\n. We end this article by quoting from\n[\n4\n]\nBass's views on the biggest challenges facing the mathematics profession:-\nThere are two perennial issues. One has to do with resources to support the research enterprise. That is a constant campaign with federal and public agencies. And the other is whether we are drawing enough talent into the field to maintain quality and productivity.",
