  "biografia": "Hermann BrÃ¼ck\nwas the son of Hermann Heinrich BrÃ¼ck and Margaret Anne Weylandt. His father served in the German Army being a Lieutenant in\n1902\nand reaching the rank of Captain of the XX Corps of the\n9\nth Army on\n8\nNovember\n1914\n. He was killed at the Battle of LÃ³dz between the\n9\nth German Army and the Russian Army in the second half of November\n1914\n. An only child, Hermann was brought up by his mother. When he was fourteen years old he began his secondary education at the Kaiserin Augusta Gymnasium in Berlin-Charlottenburg. The school specialised in Latin, Greek and mathematics. One\n[\n5\n]\n:-\n... teacher whom I was fortunate enough to have at school gave us a four-year course in mathematics and physics. In mathematics he took us up to number theory, analytical and spherical geometry and the calculus, including differential equations. His physics classes gave us a taste of the newly-emerging field of atomic theory.\nHe graduated from the\nGymnasium\nin March\n1924\nwith top marks in mathematics and physics. He also scored top marks in athletics. For quite a while his mother had wanted Hermann to study law but for him science was the topic where his interests lie. His mother felt that there were no prospects for him if he studied science but she was persuaded by his uncle, Karl Kisskalt, a distinguished bacteriologist, that science could lead to a good career. Kisskalt held the a chair of Bacteriology and Public Health at the University of Kiel and, to see if BrÃ¼ck was good enough, he arranged for his colleague\nOtto Toeplitz\nto test his ability. His success in this oral test led to him matriculating at the University of Kiel in May\n1924\n. He had, however, had his first meeting with \"a real astronomer\" for when he went to Kiel to be tested by\nToeplitz\nhe met Carl Wirtz at the University Observatory.\nAt this time German university students would typically spend time at different universities. BrÃ¼ck moved more than most, spending the summer semester of\n1924\nat Kiel, the winter semester of\n1924\nat Munich and the summer semester of\n1925\nat Bonn. He then returned to Munich\n[\n5\n]\n:-\nThe time from my matriculation at Munich in the winter semester\n1925\n-\n26\nto my graduation in the summer of\n1928\nwas the most enjoyable and the most fruitful period of my student years.\nHe was taught astronomy by Alexander Wilkens who used as texts\nFelix Tisserand\n's\nMÃ©chanique CÃ©leste\nand\nHenri PoincarÃ©\n's\nMethodes Nouvelles\n. At Munich he was taught mathematics by\nConstantin CarathÃ©odory\n, who gave an analytic mechanics course, and\nOskar Perron\n, who gave an algebra course\n[\n5\n]\n:-\nMy attitude to astronomy changed dramatically, however, in my second semester\n(\nsummer\n1926)\nwhen I experienced the lectures of Professor\nArnold Sommerfeld\n.\nSommerfeld\nwas the most brilliant university teacher I ever met. His lectures were models of clarity, and beautifully delivered, He would fill the two large blackboards in his lovely handwriting with never a mistake. Though I found myself at the wrong end of his\n6\n-semester course on theoretical physics, I was able to keep up quite well with his lectures even in my first semester - partial differential equations of physics - introduced with a discussion of\nFourier\n's work.\nSommerfeld\nhimself - and the subject matter of his lectures - aroused my immense enthusiasm and the wish to make theoretical physics rather than astronomy my main field of study. Mathematics and astronomy would then be my secondary subjects.\nBrÃ¼ck continued to study\nSommerfeld\n's courses on quantum and wave mechanics but continued to take mathematics courses, particularly, in BrÃ¼ck's words, \"the brilliant lectures of\nCarathÃ©odory\n.\" He also took both a lecture course and a laboratory course by\nWilhelm Wien\non experimental physics.\nTo study for a doctorate under\nSommerfeld\n, BrÃ¼ck had to join\nSommerfeld\n's seminar and to do this he had to prove he was good enough by presenting details of a recent paper. He was asked to present\nErwin SchrÃ¶dinger\n's paper\nQuantizierzung als Eigenwertproblem, StÃ¶rungstheorie und Anwendung auf den Starkeffekt der Balmerlinien\nâ\n(\nQuantization as eigenvalue problem, perturbation theory and application to the powerful effect of the Balmer lines\n)\n[\n5\n]\n:-\nIt is no exaggeration to say that never in all my life did I work as hard day and night as I did on that occasion! However, my talk went well, and I was formally accepted as a member of\nSommerfeld\n's Seminar. Twenty years later, when Professor\nSchrÃ¶dinger\nand I were colleagues at the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, we laughed heartily as I recalled my ordeal of\n1926\n.\nOne speaker at the seminar is worth noting, namely\nWerner Heisenberg\nwho gave his first lecture on his 'uncertainty principle' in\n1927\n.\nThere was the social side of being\nSommerfeld\n's student as well as the academic side\n[\n5\n]\n:-\nA delightful aspect of becoming a student of\nSommerfeld\n's was the opportunity of getting to know him on the ski slopes. He was an expert skier, and had a Hulte or cabin in the mountains at Bayerische Zell where his assistants and senior students, as well as occasional foreign visitors - ten or so people altogether - would be invited to spend weekends. ... In those days we carried our skis on our shoulders, and trudged all the way up the icy track - a far cry from today's ski-lifts. These weekends in the mountains were among the highlights of my student days.\nHis thesis was on wave-mechanical calculations of the forces which keep ions apart in salt crystals. After his thesis was published and accepted, he was examined orally in theoretical physics, experimental physics, mathematics and astronomy. His examiners for these four topics were, respectively,\nArnold Sommerfeld\n,\nWilhelm Wien\n,\nHeinrich Tietze\nand Alexander Wilkens. BrÃ¼ck graduated with his doctorate, magna cum laude, from the University of Munich on\n24\nJuly\n1928\n.\nIt was\nSommerfeld\nwho suggested the next step in BrÃ¼ck's career.\nSommerfeld\nwas fascinated by\nArthur Eddington\n's book\nThe Internal Constitution of Stars\n(1926)\nand, knowing that BrÃ¼ck loved astronomy, suggested that he should work on astrophysics. Germany had set up the\nEinstein\nInstitute as part of the Potsdam Astrophysical Observatory in\n1920\nand,\nFinlay Freundlich\n, who had been appointed there as an observer in\n1921\n, was by this time the head of the\nEinstein\nInstitute. This, suggested\nSommerfeld\n, would be the right career move so he recommended BrÃ¼ck to\nFreundlich\nwho awarded him a Research Fellowship\n[\n5\n]\n:-\nOn my arrival in Potsdam I was very kindly received by Professor\nFreundlich\nand his scientific staff ... I found\nFreundlich\nand KlÃ¼ber\n[\nHarald von KlÃ¼ber,\nFreundlich\n's assistant\n]\nbusy preparing for an expedition to Sumatra where they planned to observe the total eclipse of the Sun of\n9\nMay\n1929\n.\nFreundlich\nhad been working with\nEinstein\nattempting to verify the general theory of relativity from astronomical observations. At this time BrÃ¼ck lived at the Observatory during the week and returned to his family home in Berlin at the weekends. As well as working at the Observatory, he attended physics colloquia at the University of Berlin where he delivered a lecture on the Stark effect in stellar spectra. He met many scientists such as\nEinstein\nat the Colloquia and\nA E Milne\nat the Observatory. Recreation was taking walks in the woods round the Observatory and playing tennis in the Observatory grounds.\nAfter two years on the Research Fellowship, BrÃ¼ck was offered a permanent post at the Observatory. His research work involved the spectral classification of southern hemisphere stars from spectra on photographic plates taken at the Potsdam Observatory's site at La Paz, Bolivia. He attended meetings of the German Astronomical Society in Bern and GÃ¶ttingen and, at the GÃ¶ttingen meeting, for the first time some participants were in Nazi uniform.\nBrÃ¼ck had been brought up a Lutheran but, under the influence of two Roman Catholics, converted to Roman Catholicism in\n1935\n. The two who influenced him were Romano Guardini\n(1885\n-\n1968)\n, an Italian-born Catholic priest whose whole career was in Germany, and Johannes Pinsk\n(1891\n-\n1957)\nwho, from\n1929\n, was managing director of the Association of Catholic Academics in Berlin. In\n1936\nBrÃ¼ck abruptly left Germany with his girl friend Irma Waitzfelder\n(1905\n-\n1950)\nand he went to Italy to work as a research assistant at the Vatican Observatory at Castel Gandolfo. He married Irma on\n8\nSeptember\n1936\nin Rome. After a year in Italy, BrÃ¼ck travelled to England where he took up a post as Assistant Observer at the Solar Physics Observatory in Cambridge, working under\nArthur Eddington\n. Hermann and Irma BrÃ¼ck had two children, Maria C BrÃ¼ck\n(\nbirth registered in Cambridge\n4\nth quarter of\n1937)\n, and Peter Michael BrÃ¼ck born\n22\nMarch\n1940\nin Cambridge. Peter BrÃ¼ck became a geologist at University College Dublin\n(1964\n-\n68)\n, the Geographical Survey Ireland\n(1968\n-\n79)\nand Professor of Geology at University College, Cork since\n1979\n.\nAfter World War II broke out in September\n1939\n, BrÃ¼ck was a German living in England with the two countries at war. He was interned as an enemy alien, but within six months he was released and allowed to return to Cambridge after\nEddington\nhad worked to secure this. In\n1943\n, in addition to his post at the Cambridge Observatory, he was appointed\nJohn Couch Adams\nAstronomer at Cambridge University.\nEddington\ndied in\n1944\n, and in\n1946\nBrÃ¼ck became the Assistant Director of the Cambridge Observatory. In the following year\nÃamon de Valera\ninvited him to become director of the Dunsink Observatory and Professor of Astronomy at the new Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nHe was delighted to join his old friend,\nErwin SchrÃ¶dinger\n, then Professor of Theoretical Physics at the Institute, and Professor BrÃ¼ck spent\n10\nhappy years here. The observatory had fallen into disuse during the troubled years after the foundation of the State and\nde Valera\nhad included its restoration amongst his projects at the close of the Second World War. Professor BrÃ¼ck had a major impact on astronomy\n[\nin Ireland\n]\n, as indicated by Sir Francis Graham-Smith, Astronomer Royal in Britain from\n1982\n-\n1990\n, who recounts: \"The unification of astronomy in Ireland which has survived the Troubles was a triumph for BrÃ¼ck. The particular collaboration was between Armagh and Dunsink and the Boyden Observatory in South Africa, which was set up by BrÃ¼ck and handed over to the joint management of the Irish observatories. There is a recent echo of this development in the Canary Islands, where the two different parts of the island of Ireland work in complete collaboration with one another.\"\nWhile he was in Ireland, in\n1950\n, his wife Irma died. On\n21\nNovember\n1951\nhe married MÃ¡ire Teresa Conway\n(1925\n-\n2008)\nwho, away from Ireland, seems to have almost exclusively used 'Mary' the Anglicised version of her name. After a first degree in physics from University College Dublin, she had studied at the University of Edinburgh where she was awarded a Ph.D. in\n1950\nfor her thesis on solar physics. She returned to Dublin taking up a position at Dunsink Observatory where she met BrÃ¼ck; they had three children, Anne, Catherine and Andrew. After ten years in Dublin, BrÃ¼ck was offered the position of Astronomer Royal for Scotland, Director of the Royal Observatory Edinburgh, and Regius Professor of Astronomy at Edinburgh University\n[\n7\n]\n:-\nHis family relocated to Scotland with him, moving into the purpose-built residence for the Astronomer Royal in the grounds of the Royal Observatory Edinburgh on Backford Hill in Edinburgh.\nMartin Rees writes\n[\n9\n]\n:-\nBrÃ¼ck's tenure at Edinburgh lasted from\n1957\nuntil his retirement in\n1975\n, and during that time the observatory staff numbers expanded from eight to more than one hundred. He fostered the work ... on new telescopes. He thereby prepared the way for instruments which greatly boosted the UK's international standing in astronomy - especially the\n40\n-inch UK Schmidt telescope in Australia, which produced a photographic survey of the southern sky, and the pioneering Cosmos machine which could automatically scan the resulting photographic plates at high speed. He also laid the groundwork for the UK infra-red telescope and the\nJames Clerk Maxwell\nradio telescope in Hawaii. He championed the establishment of observing stations in climates better than that of Great Britain and was a prime advocate of a United Kingdom northern hemisphere observatory in the Canary Islands.\nColin Campbell, a mathematics colleague of the authors of this article at St Andrews for\n50\nyears, writes:-\nAs a mathematics student at the University of Edinburgh from\n1960\n-\n64\nI took an Astronomy course in\n1961\nwith Professor BrÃ¼ck being one of the two lecturers. I still remember well the interesting lecture where he described how the satellite ECHO\n1\nhad provided new information about the shape of Earth. Such was his enthusiasm for astronomy that I was pleased to be a member of Astrosoc, the student astronomical society, throughout my time at Edinburgh. I also had two summer vacation jobs at the Royal Observatory. One year I worked on calibrating photographic plates and the second year I worked in the Observatory library.\nBrÃ¼ck served as Dean of the Faculty of Science of the University of Edinburgh in\n1968\n-\n1970\n. After retiring, BrÃ¼ck's interests turned to the history of astronomy and he wrote two important books,\nThe Story of Astronomy in Edinburgh\n(1983)\n, and, jointly with his wife Mary BrÃ¼ck,\nThe Peripatetic Astronomer: a biography of Charles Piazzi Smyth\n(1988)\n.\nBrÃ¼ck received many honours of which we mention the most important: elected to the\nRoyal Irish Academy\n(1948)\n, elected to the\nRoyal Society of Edinburgh\n(1958)\n, elected to the Akademie der Wissenschaften und der Literatur Mainz\n(1955)\n, elected to the\nPontifical Academy of Sciences\n(1955)\n, served on the Council of the\nPontifical Academy of Sciences\n(1964\n-\n86)\n, made a Commander of the British Empire\n(1966)\n, awarded an honorary D.Sc. from the National University of Ireland\n(1972)\n, awarded an honorary D.Sc. from the University of St Andrews\n(1973)\n, appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Gregory the Great by Pope John Paul II in\n1995\n.\nHe died in the Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh, from pulmonary embolism, on\n4\nMarch\n2000\n, and was buried on\n11\nMarch at Mortonhall Cemetery, Edinburgh. Mary BrÃ¼ck died on\n11\nDecember\n2008\nand following a Funeral Mass on\n22\nDecember in the Sacred Heart Church, Penicuik, Midlothian, Scotland, she was buried beside her husband in Mortonhall Cemetery.\nLet us end with this tribute by Peter Brand\n[\n3\n]\n:-\nDespite his personal drive and the lasting success it brought, and despite his awe-inspiring and elegant presence, he was a modest and gentle man, seen to best effect in the heart of his family.",
