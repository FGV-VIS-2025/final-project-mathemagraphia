  "biografia": "J Presper Eckert Jr\nattended the William Penn Carter School in Germanstown. In\n1937\n, after graduating from school, he entered the Moore School of Electrical Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania from where he graduated in\n1941\n. Eckert, an outstanding electrical engineering student, was given a post as an instructor at the Moore School soon after his graduation.\nThe Moore School was by this time heavily involved with research specifically directed towards the war effort. Eckert taught a defence course at the Moore School and one of his students on the course was\nJohn Mauchly\n. It might seem strange that\nMauchly\n, who was twelve years older than Eckert, should be his student.\nMauchly\nwas already an established academic teaching physics but he became involved in defence training as part of his contribution to the war effort. Eckert quickly became interested in Mauchly's ideas for the development of computers and for a while the two discussed these ideas frequently. Soon, however, Eckert moved on to undertake other military work at the School. Ashurst\n[\n2\n]\nrelates how Eckert was:-\n.... eventually involved with work on ultraviolet light and the development of the means to measure metal fatigue. Later, he went on to develop a method for measuring small magnetic fields to be used in detecting marine mines. He then went on to work on the electronics of radar and target locating and following equipment; these devices played a decisive part in weaponry, and their development and construction was considered to be of the very highest priority.\nAfter\nMauchly\n's report on the construction of a computer was accepted, Eckert collaborated with him in the construction of the Electronic Integrator and Computer\n(\nENIAC\n)\n. At this time, May\n1943\n, Eckert had almost completed the work for his masters degree and he was appointed as chief engineer on the project with the specific task of designing the electronic circuits. One of the major problems which had to be solved was how a machine with\n18000\nvalves could function when the valves were relatively unreliable. This was one of the many problems which Eckert had to solve and he eventually achieved a lifetime of\n2500\nhours for each individual valve which made the operation of the computer viable.\nThe ENIAC computer was intended to be a general purpose one, but it was also designed for a very specific task, namely compiling tables for the trajectories of bombs and shells. ENIAC is described in\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nCompleted by February\n1946\n, the ENIAC was the first general-purpose electronic digital computer. It contained roughly\n18000\nvacuum tubes and measured about\n2\n.\n5\nmetres in height and\n24\nmetres in length. The machine was more than\n1000\ntimes faster than its electromechanical predecessors and could execute up to\n5000\nadditions per second. Its operation was controlled by a program that was set up externally by wires on plugboards. The ENIAC was the most complex and influential electronic computer of its time ...\nElectronic computers are today machines based on binary arithmetic but this was not so for the ENIAC computer. Eckert designed electronic calculators which worked to base\n10\nfor the ENIAC, reducing the number of components over a binary machine, but of course at the price of greater complexity.\nOf course by\n1946\nwhen the ENIAC was completed World War II was over but the computer was used intensively, particularly on top secret problems associated with the development of nuclear weapons.\nVon Neumann\nwas working on this project and became involved with the ENIAC computer and used it to solve systems of\npartial differential equations\nwhich were crucial in the work on atomic weapons at Los Almos.\nEckert left the Moore School at the University of Pennsylvania in October\n1946\n, as did\nMauchly\n. They started up the Electronic Control Company which they received an order from Northrop Aircraft Company to build the Binary Automatic Computer\n(\nBINAC\n)\n. One of the major advances of this machine, which was used from August\n1950\n, was that data was stored on magnetic tape rather than on punched cards.\nThe Electronic Control Company become the Eckert-\nMauchly\nComputer Corporation and it received an order from the National Bureau of Standards to build the Universal Automatic Computer\n(\nUNIVAC\n)\n. This was the first computer to be produced commercially in the United States with\n46\nUNIVACs being built. One of the major advances which the UNIVAC introduced was an ability to handle both numerical and alphabetical information with equal success.\nEckert and\nMauchly\nwere better at computer design than they were at the economics of running a company. The problem really lay in the fact that this was such a new area that costs of production were extremely hard to estimate. As a consequence the Eckert-Mauchly Computer Corporation soon hit financial difficulties.\nIn\n1950\nthe Remington Rand Corporation acquired the Eckert-\nMauchly\nComputer Corporation and changed its name to the Univac Division of Remington Rand. Eckert remained with Remington Rand and became an executive of the corporation. He continued with the company as it merged with the Burroughs Corporation to become Unisys. In\n1989\nEckert retired from Unisys but continued to act as a consultant for the company.\nBetween\n1948\nand\n1966\nEckert took out patents on\n85\ninventions, almost all electronic in nature. He received many awards for his pioneering work on computers. In\n1966\nhe received the Harry M Goode Memorial Award, a medal and $\n2\n,\n000\nawarded by the Computer Society:-\nFor his pioneering contributions to automatic computing by participating in the design and construction of the ENIAC, the world's first all-electronic computer, and of the BINAC and the UNIVAC, and for his continuing work in the design of electronic computing systems.\nEckert received many awards for his pioneering work on computers. He was elected to the National Academy of Engineering in\n1967\nbut perhaps the most prestigious honour was being awarded the US National Medal of Science in\n1969\n. Both Eckert and\nMauchly\nreceived the IEEE Computer Society Pioneer Award in\n1980\n.\nEckert died from complications relating to leukaemia.",
