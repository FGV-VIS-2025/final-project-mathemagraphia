  "biografia": "Cora Ratto de Sadosky\nwas given the name\nCorina EloÃ­sa Ratto\nand only used the name\nRatto de Sadosky\nafter her marriage to\nManuel Sadosky\n. She was the daughter of Livio Benito Ratto and Francisca Butta. Livio Benito Ratto\n(\nborn\n1882)\n, the son of Francesco and Sabina Ratto who were both born in Italy, was, as a representative of Club Santa Rosa, one of the founders of the River Plate football club and served as its president\n1917\n-\n1919\n. Livio and Francisca Ratto had three children: Corina EloÃ­sa Ratto\n(\nborn\n3\nJanuary\n1912)\n, the subject of this biography, Carlos Francisco Ratto\n(\nborn\n23\nMay\n1913)\n, and Livia \"LÃ­a\" Susana Ratto\n(\nborn\n26\nDecember\n1916)\n.\nCora Ratto attended schools in Buenos Aires and, around\n1932\n, she entered the Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales of the University of Buenos Aires. There she studied mathematics with the aim of becoming a high school mathematics teacher. During her undergraduate years, Ratto was highly involved in university political activities. She became one of the leaders of the Argentine University Federation\n(\nthe FUA, FederaciÃ³n Universitaria Argentina\n)\nwhich had been founded in\n1918\nwith the aim of changing the university system so that teachers, graduates, and students would participate in the government of the universities. There were other causes she felt passionately about, fighting against oppression, discrimination, and racism. She felt strongly about discrimination against women in the exact sciences and this led to her becoming a leader of the student movement. During her undergraduate years the Chaco War was being fought between Bolivia and Paraguay from\n1932\nto\n1935\n. This war was being fought for control of a region which was rich in oil and Cora Ratto felt that the war was being forced on her neighbours Bolivia and Paraguay by the United States and Great Britain; she strongly denounced the war.\nThe mathematics staff in the University of Buenos Aires when Ratto was a student consisted of\nJulio Rey Pastor\n, the only paid professor, and Juan Carlos Vignaux, who held an honorary position. There were, however, a number of outstanding students of mathematics at that time.\nManuel Sadosky\nwas in the same class as Ratto and Yanny Frankel was also a student. In\n1935\nMischa Cotlar\njoined them when he began studying mathematics at the University of Buenos Aires.\nManuel Sadosky\nwrites\n[\n10\n]\n:-\nAfter a short while,\nMischa Cotlar\ntold Cora that he missed playing the piano very much. Music allowed him to take refuge from the often dismal surrounding reality to enter a world of peace and harmony. Cora immediately invited him to play at her home and, after a long argument, convinced Mischa to accept the offer. Cora's mother delighted in Mischa's playing and always considered it a great personal vindication to have met a talented young man willing to use an instrument she had not succeeded in making important to her own children.\nCora Ratto graduated in Physical-Mathematical Sciences in September\n1937\nand in the same year she married\nManuel Sadosky\n. Her daughter wrote in\n[\n7\n]\n:-\nIn\n1937\nCora Ratto married\nManuel Sadosky\n, her lifelong companion both in mathematics and in political activities.\nManuel\nwas a bookish and intense young man from a poor Jewish family whose parents had fled the pogroms in tsarist Russia in\n1905\n. Since the thirties were times of rampant anti-Semitism, Cora chose to use her married name, Cora Ratto de Sadosky, from that time on. ... Cora and Manuel shared a long and happy marriage. Their house was always full of friends, attracted by a hostess who was not only a superb cook, but also a great conversationalist, mixing witticism with wisdom and genuine caring. Cora and\nManuel\nhad one daughter\n[\nCora Sadosky\n]\n- who also became a mathematician - and one granddaughter, who became the greatest joy of her life. Both of them are called Cora!\nThe Spanish Civil War had started in\n1936\nfought between the Republicans and the Nationalists. The Republicans supported the left-wing Popular front government. Argentina, with its close Spanish roots, was much involved and the AsociaciÃ³n Femenina Antiguerrera\n(\nWomen's Anti-war Association\n)\nwas formed that carried out activities in favour of the Republicans. Ratto de Sadosky participated in this Anti-war Association playing an active part in collecting food and organising events with speakers against the war. The rise of the Nazis in Germany was also something that Ratto de Sadosky strongly opposed and after Germany invaded Russia in\n1941\n, she together with Maria Rosa Oliver created La junta de la Victoria, a women's organisation aimed at defending democracy and supporting the allied effort against the Nazis. Ratto de Sadosky and other members of the Victory Union collected money, clothing and food to send to the troops. La junta de la Victoria was highly successful with around\n45\n,\n000\nmembers by\n1943\n. Ratto de Sadosky served as General Secretary and was one of the delegates of La junta de la Victoria at the First International Congress of Women in Paris at the end of\n1945\n. In this role she played a part in founding the International Democratic Federation of Women.\nCora Sadosky\nwrites\n[\n7\n]\n:-\nIn\n1945\nLa junta, with Cora at its helm, had\n50\n,\n000\nvolunteers - in a country with fewer than\n12\nmillion people - and made a substantial contribution to the Allies' war efforts with money, clothing, and food for the fighting troops. Not only was La junta significant for its solidarity against the Nazis, but it was the first women's mass organisation of its size in Latin American history. In December\n1945\n, as one of two representatives of her organisation, Cora was a founding member of the International Women's Union at its first meeting in Paris.\nManuel Sadosky\nworked for his doctorate in physics and mathematics at the University of Buenos Aires, and then, after World War II ended, went for post-doctoral studies to the\nHenri PoincarÃ©\nInstitute in Paris, advised by\nGeorges Darmois\nand\nMaurice FrÃ©chet\n, supported by a scholarship from the government of France. Ratto de Sadosky travelled to Paris with her husband and baby daughter\nCora Sadosky\nin October\n1946\nand there she undertook research for a doctorate advised by\nMaurice FrÃ©chet\n. However, she did not complete her doctorate at this time since the family left Paris and went to Italy in January\n1948\nwhere\nManuel Sadosky\nworked with\nMauro Picone\nat the Istituto per l'Applicazioni del Calcolo in Rome. Ratto de Sadosky and her husband returned to Argentina in\n1949\n.\nJuan PerÃ³n had been elected president of Argentina in\n1946\nand in\n1949\nintroduced Constitutional Reforms. These were not supported by all and were opposed by the Radicals who declared the Peronists did not have the required majority to make constitutional changes. Universities lost their autonomy and opponents of the Constitutional Reforms pointed out that PerÃ³n had centralised too much power in his own hands\n[\n7\n]\n:-\nThe Sadoskys returned to Argentina during a period of turmoil and political repression. They were banned from teaching at public universities, as were all those not affiliated with the party in power, and Cora went to work at a commercial enterprise to support the family.\nIn\n1955\nPerÃ³n began to lose the support of the military and, after a failed coup in June\n1955\n, another in September\n1955\nsucceeded and PerÃ³n fled to exile in Spain. Although there was an unstable political situation over the following years, the universities regained their autonomy in\n1956\n. Ratto de Sadosky was able to restart her doctoral studies at the University of Buenos Aires advised by\nMischa Cotlar\n. She was awarded a doctorate in\n1959\nfor her thesis\nCondiciones de continuidad de operadores potenciales generalizados, con mÃ©trica hiperbÃ³lica\nâ\n(\nContinuity conditions of generalized potential operators, with hyperbolic metric\n)\n. She begins the thesis as follows:-\nIn this work we extend to hyperbolic potential operators\n(\nin two-dimensional spaces\n)\nsome basic continuity properties of elliptic potential operators.\nShe gives the following acknowledgements:-\nThe subject of this work was proposed to me by Professor\nMischa Cotlar\n, who has directed the research and has taught and helped me with a dedication that requires my recognition and admiration. In the particular circumstances in which I began this study, after years away from mathematical work, it is not only Dr\nCotlar\nwhom I must thank for his encouragement and help, but also several of the members of the mathematics faculty and, in particular, Dr\nAlberto GonzÃ¡lez DomÃ­nguez\nwho prompted my return to work with his proverbial enthusiasm and generosity. I cannot omit the thanks I owe to Dr Oscar Varsavsky for his friendly and invaluable advice.\nFor the ten years,\n1956\n-\n1966\n, she was at the University of Buenos Aires and helped build up mathematical studies there\n[\n7\n]\n:-\nFrom\n1958\nto\n1966\nshe was an associate professor of mathematics.\n(\nShe never became a full professor, nor did she achieve due recognition for her research. While she did not complain about having a harder time in her profession for being a woman, she was acutely aware that this was the case.\n)\nDuring her decade at the university, Cora initiated and edited a celebrated series of research publications\n(\nthe first volume, 'Mathematics and Quantum Physics', was written by\nLaurent Schwartz\n,\nFields\nMedal,\n1950\n, the third, 'Singular integrals and Hyperbolic Partial Differential Equations', by the Argentinean-born mathematician\nAlberto CalderÃ³n\n, National Medal of Science,\n1991)\n; this series became an important resource for library interchanges. She also organised a host of advanced courses for several generations of mathematicians, physicists, and chemists, many of whom later became leading scientists in the United States, Latin America, Canada, and Europe. Cora was most remarkable as a teacher. She devoted a part of her immense energy to teaching the first courses in calculus and algebra. She was idolised by her students, who clung to her every word and used to say that they \"were willing to go to the barricades for modern algebra!\" With her husband, she co-organised an entire teaching system for several hundred students, where thanks to the use of scores of senior and regular teaching assistants and student mentors, they gave a personalised education to each and everyone.\nRatto de Sadosky taught calculus and algebra, and she taught first year classes on mathematics, physics, and chemistry. Together with\nManuel Sadosky\n, she designed a teaching system that allowed her to provide personalised education to her students whom she inspired with her own passion and mathematical approach. She taught algebra courses for several years and she used her experience with these courses to co-author the textbook\nIntroducciÃ³n al Algebra Lineal\nâ\n(\nIntroduction to linear algebra\n)\n(1966)\nwith\nMischa Cotlar\n. A review of this book states\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nThis work takes the reader from what in the U.S. is high-school algebra to the main concepts of\n(\npre-homological\n)\nabstract and linear algebra. A course employing this book as text should be able to both initiate the student to the concepts and techniques of algebra and prepare him for graduate-level work. The plan of the book is as follows: an introduction\n(\ndiscussing the various number systems\n)\n, algebraic structures\n(\nrelations and operations, propositional algebra, groups, rings, fields, polynomials\n)\n, and linear algebra\n(\nvector spaces, matrices and linear transformations, linear andÂ p-linear forms, determinants, systems of linear equations, inner products, and eigenvalues - all over the reals\n)\n. There are many examples, carefully presented; while there are relatively few exercises, many of the simple verifications are left to the student. Relationships between different structures are brought out well.Â For this reader, strong points include a careful treatment of the various \"relations and operations\", construction of the splitting field of a polynomial, and the presentation of determinants\n(\nasÂ p-linear alternating forms\n(\nafter a discussion of the conventional determinants of orders two and three\n)\n. ...\nThere were two other achievement by Ratto de Sadosky made during her ten years at the University of Buenos Aires which we should mention. One of these is academic, the other political. The academic achievement was setting up in\n1957\n, in collaboration with\nMischa Cotlar\n, the FundaciÃ³n\nAlberto Einstein\n, with the aim to assist the study of talented young people who were lacking in financial resources by providing scholarships. It also provided mentoring for these young people. The second achievement was creating in\n1965\nthe monthly magazine\nColumna\n10\nwhich, by linking science, ethics and politics, analysed events such as the war of Vietnam and the nuclear arms race. This was edited by\nMischa Cotlar\n, Cora Ratto de Sadosky and the architect Francisco Bullrich. They write in their first editorial:-\nWe are a group of independent people who, despite having different ideologies and different philosophical positions, believe we can carry out together a task that we all find useful: to provide as many people as possible with as much complementary information as possible, to encourage the formation of their own judgments that each one feels in a position to justify for themselves.\nEach issue opened with a brief note explaining the reason for its name:-\nNewspapers generally have nine columns; 'Columna\n10\n' aspires to contain information that is not normally disseminated and that may be useful for a correct understanding of the current reality.\nAs an example of the content, the second issue contains the article\nBarbarism in the free world. War of atrocities in Vietnam\nby\nBertrand Russell\n.\nProduction of the magazine\nColumna\n10\nended with the ninth issue in May\n1966\nwhen an Argentinian coup made continuing impossible. Arturo Illia had become President of Argentina following elections in June\n1963\n. He tried to split the PerÃ³nists, who controlled the unions, from their exiled leader PerÃ³n. The PerÃ³nists reacted by supporting a coup against President Arturo Illia in June\n1966\nÂ and General Juan Carlos OnganÃ­a, the commander in chief of the army, took control of the country. Following the military takeover, the University of Buenos Aires was attacked by police in July\n1966\n.\nManuel Sadosky\nand Cora Ratto de Sadosky were at a Board of Directors meeting on the night of\n29\nJuly when the police arrived at the Faculty and began to attack and arrest teachers, graduates and students on what became known as the 'Night of the Long Batons'.\nManuel\n, Cora and their daughter all resigned their positions at the university in protest. They were not alone, for around\n400\nÂ faculty members resigned in protest at the police brutality directed at the university staff. From this time on, Ratto de Sadosky concentrated her efforts on trying to publicise the human rights abuses which the military regime was perpetrating.\nFor a newspaper article which gives details of the problems that the Sadosky family experienced inÂ\n1966\n, see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nMany academics left the country immediately after the coup of\n1966\nbut\nManuel Sadosky\nand Cora Ratto de Sadosky spent several years living part of the time in Buenos Aires and part in Montevideo. In\n1973\nJuan PerÃ³n returned to Argentina and became President again on\n12\nOctober\n1973\n. He died in the following July, but was succeeded by his wife Isabel PerÃ³n. From\n1973\nto\n1976\nthe Argentine Anticommunist Alliance\n(\nknown as the Triple A\n)\nwas a PerÃ³nist death squad that killed leftist academics, politicians, union members etc. In\n1974\nthe Argentine Anticommunist Alliance threatened Cora Ratto de Sadosky and her family who left Argentina and went into exile in Caracas, Venezuela, where they lived until\n1979\n. Their apartment in Caracas was the meeting place for many Argentines. In\n1979\n, together with her husband, she moved to Barcelona, Spain where she continued fighting against oppression. She rejected the human rights violations perpetrated during the last military dictatorship and assisted other exiles who had fled to Spain.",
