  "biografia": "Otton Marcin Nikodym\n(\nsometimes written\nOtto Martin Nikodym\n)\nwas born in ZabÅotÃ³w near Kolomyja in the province of StanisÅawow to a Roman Catholic family. His father Otton Boguslaw was a chemical engineer and came from an old Czech family of Nikodyms from Zlutice. He died in an accident when Otton was only one year old and soon after that his mother Marianna Cyprian, from an Italian family, also died. He was brought up by his maternal grandparents Marcin Cyprian\n(\nof Italian origin\n)\nand Amalia Bott de Pirot\n(\nof French origin\n)\n. Marcin Cyprian had trained as an architect\n[\n7\n]\n:-\nHe had a lively mind and broad horizons, and he liked to give his children mathematical problems to solve. Otton's uncles told him years later that his mother Marianna excelled at the solutions.\nMarcin Cyprian became the director of a tobacco factory in Vienna and the family moved there. It was in Vienna that Otton, originally Polish speaking, began his education, being sent to a Roman Catholic boarding school where he became fluent in German. After a short stay in Vienna the whole family returned to Lemberg\n(\nnow Lviv in Ukraine\n)\nin\n1897\nwhere he attended the mathematical gymnasium. It was at this school that he first developed a passion for mathematics. Alicja Derkowska relates this interesting story about how his passion for mathematics began\n[\n7\n]\n:-\n... during one of the lessons, the teacher gave the following definition of division: to divide one number by another means to find the third, which, when multiplied by the second, gives the first. The teacher repeated this definition very quickly, without supplementing it with any examples or explanations, and then began to call the students by the alphabet and demand that they recite it correctly. In this way, he reached the letter N and Otto began to pray for the bell to end the lesson, because none of his classmates had repeated this definition correctly so far. Fortunately, the bell rang just in time. After returning home, Otto began to think about the definition, recall it and try to understand its meaning. In the next lesson, he was able to formulate it correctly and support it with his own example. He received a very good grade, and at the same time, pondering this problem and understanding the need for precision in formulations gave rise to a deep passion for mathematics.\nIn\n1905\nhe passed his Gymnasium leaving examination with distinction and prepared himself for the examinations in Latin and Greek, which were not taught in the mathematical gymnasium, and also obtained a classical Gymnasium diploma in\n1908\n. He then studied mathematics, physics, chemistry, philosophy and pedagogy at the University of LwÃ³w\n(\nas Lemberg was then known\n)\n. Let us note that at this time this university was named the Franz I University in LwÃ³w and teaching was in Polish. In the period between the two World Wars it was called the Jan Kazimierz University and now it is in Ukraine and named the Ivan Franko National University of Lviv.\nIn the early\n1900\ns there were only two mathematics professors,\nJÃ³zef Puzyna\nand Jan Rajewski, and no assistants in mathematics at the University of LwÃ³w.\nJÃ³zef Puzyna\n(1856\n-\n1919)\nhad completed his doctorate in LwÃ³w, and had then gone to Germany where he attended lectures given by\nKronecker\nand\nFuchs\n. He had been appointed professor in the University of LwÃ³w in\n1892\n. Jan Rajewski\n(1857\n-\n1906)\nhad also been awarded a doctorate from LwÃ³w and had been appointed as a professor in\n1900\n. Rajewski, however, died in\n1906\nand never taught Nikodym. In\n1908\nWacÅaw SierpiÅski\nwas appointed as a mathematics lecturer. Theoretical physics lectures were delivered by\nMarian Smoluchowski\n.\nSmoluchowski\nhad studied in Vienna, then at\nKelvin\n's laboratory in Glasgow, in Paris and in Berlin. In\n1906\nJan Åukasiewicz submitted his\nhabilitation\nthesis to LwÃ³w and began lecturing on logic. Kazimierz Twardowski\n(1866\n-\n1938)\n, who had been awarded a PhD and habilitation in philosophy from the University of Vienna, had been appointed to LwÃ³w.\nNikodym studied under\nSierpiÅski\n,\nPuzyna\n,\nSmoluchowski\nand the others mentioned above. He was most influenced by\nSierpiÅski\n's seminar on higher mathematics and\nSmoluchowski\n's seminar on theoretical physics. Others who taught Nikodym included Konstanty Zakshevsky who taught physics, BronisÅaw Radziszewski who taught chemistry, Mankovsky who taught pedagogy, and\nJan Åukasiewicz\nwho taught philosophy.\nHere are the courses Nikodym took in the summer semester of\n1910\n: two courses\nEthical scepticism\nand\nDevelopment of modern philosophy from Kant\nfrom Kazimierz Twardowski; two courses\nOrdinary differential equations\nand\nConformal mappings\nfrom\nJÃ³zef Puzyna\n;\nExercises in physics\nfrom Konstanty Zakshevsky;\nGeneral chemistry\nfrom BronisÅaw Radziszewski, and two courses\nCriticism of the main concepts of education\nand\nPedagogical seminar\nfrom Mankovsky. In the summer semester of\n1911\nNikodym took:\nHigher mathematics seminar\nfrom\nPuzyna\n; three courses\nApplication of set theory to analysis\n,\nHigher algebra\n, and\nLower mathematics seminar\nfrom\nWacÅaw SierpiÅski\n; three courses\nKinetic theory of matter\n,\nElectrical conductivity of gases\nand\nExercises in theoretical physics\nfrom\nMarian Smoluchowski\n, and\nPhilosophy of mathematics\nfrom\nJan Åukasiewicz\n.\nIn\n1911\nNikodym graduated in mathematics and also received a licence to teach mathematics and physics in high schools. Immediately after that he started his job at the IV Real Gymnasium in KrakÃ³w where he remained until\n1924\n. Kamil Kraft\n(1873\n-\n1945)\nwas the head mathematics teacher at this Gymnasium. He was a physician being a graduate of medicine and a doctor of medical sciences of the Jagiellonian University. He had also studied at the Philosophical Faculty of the Jagiellonian University and obtained the qualifications to teach physics and mathematics in gymnasiums and real schools.\nIn\n1915\nE Tarnawski was Nikodym's student in the fourth class in the Gymnasium and later, in a letter to\nWÅadysÅaw Orlicz\n, he wrote\n(\nsee, for example,\n[\n7\n]\n)\n:-\nOtto Nikodym is present in my consciousness as a rather unusual individual. ... In my memory, I see him as a slim, dark-haired man with a beard. He was only twenty-something, but different from others of that age, almost impersonal, as if not changing with age. Alienated and distant. ... Ascetically indifferent, with a frail physique, he did not raise his voice, but spoke constantly in a dispassionate, yet clear voice. ... The lecture was interesting due to the consistency of the content, which would seem dry, but aroused some curiosity about what would happen next. This mood was contagious, although the content was accessible only to a relatively small number of students.\nOtto Nikodym gave a presentation of knowledge, such as it is, without including his own personality, which somehow disappeared from the plan. ...\nStanisÅaw Ruziewicz\nwas similar in type to Otto Nikodym, as a university lecturer. Both also taught in a secondary school and both probably had similar results. They educated mathematical individuals, they did not find mass recipients.\nOthers had a much higher opinion of Nikodym as a teacher. An inspector from the Ministry of Education came to see him teach and was so impressed with the way he introduced new concepts that he arranged for Nikodym to receive an invitation to lecture on didactics at the Pedagogical College of the Jagiellonian University. He was happy to accept and gave these lectures for many years.\nAnother pupil in\n1922\n-\n1924\nwas Marian Miesowicz who later became later director of the Institute of Nuclear Physics and a member of the\nPolish Academy of Sciences\n. He wrote about Nikodym as a teacher\n[\n10\n]\n:-\nA feature of his teaching was an extraordinary ability to engage students in discussion. In these discussions, he tried to convince us that he was not always right. He led the discussion in such a way that he created several possibilities to reach the goal. He often led the student to discovering a new law. He had a great sense of humour and called this law, for example, the law of KosiÅski, our colleague. He gave the impression that he was pleased when a student proved him wrong. Maybe he created such situations on purpose. ... At that time, there was no differential calculus in the high school mathematics programme. But Otton Nikodym taught us elements of \"higher mathematics\" in a very original and accessible way, so that we could understand physics. He taught it beautifully, using mathematical concepts. He was able to arouse appreciation in his students, and in some, delight and enthusiasm, for the perfection and elegance of expressing the laws of physics in a strict mathematical form. Thanks to Nikodym,\n16\n-\n17\n-year-old boys could feel the perfection of describing all electromagnetic phenomena using\nMaxwell\n's equations, which he considered one of the greatest achievements of the human intellect.\nIn the early stages of World War I the Battle of Galicia was fought between Austrian and Russian forces. KrakÃ³w was under threat from the Russian army and schools and offices were closed. By March\n1915\n, however, the Austrian army had pushed the Russians back but KrakÃ³w was still in a very difficult situation being cut off. In\n[\n23\n]\nHugo Steinhaus\nrecalls a famous meeting in Planty Park in KrakÃ³w in\n1916\n. The following is a translation from the original Polish edition of the book:-\nEven though KrakÃ³w was formally a fortress, one could take walks in Planty in the evenings. During such a walk I heard a conversation, or rather just a few words; the words \"\nLebesgue\nintegral\" were so unexpected that I approached the bench and introduced myself to the two young adherents of mathematics. They told me that they had another companion,\nWitold Wilkosz\n, whom they highly praised. They were\nStefan Banach\nand Otton Nikodym. The three were united not only by mathematics, but also by the hopelessness of the situation of young people in the fortress that was KrakÃ³w at that time, the uncertainty of tomorrow, the lack of opportunities for gainful employment, and the lack of contact not only with foreign scholars, but even with Polish ones - such was the atmosphere in KrakÃ³w in\n1916\n. But that did not prevent the three from sitting in a cafÃ© and solving problems in the crowds and the hustle and bustle. Since then, we met regularly ...\nOtton Nikodym was involved in an informal mathematical society in KrakÃ³w which began in\n1917\nand, on\n2\nApril\n1919\n, he was one of the sixteen mathematicians who officially founded the Society. In addition to Nikodym, KrakÃ³w mathematicians\nStefan Banach\n,\nFranciszek Leja\n,\nStanisÅaw Zaremba\nand\nKazimierz Å»orawski\nwere among the sixteen founders. It soon became the\nPolish Mathematical Society\n.\nNikodym spent his\n1923\nsummer holiday in Zakopane, a resort at the foot of the Tatra Mountains. Many of the Polish mathematicians spent their summer holidays in Zakopane so as well as a holiday it was a chance to discuss mathematics with others. In July\n1923\nNikodym met\nStanisÅawa Dorota Liliental\nin Zakopane. She had been born on\n2\nJuly\n1897\nin Warsaw, and had studied mathematics at the University of Warsaw. Otton and\nStanisÅawa\nwere married in Warsaw on\n2\nApril\n1924\n. They returned to KrakÃ³w and both decided to register to study for their doctorates at the University of Warsaw. Most biographies state that it was only after strong pressure from\nSierpiÅski\nthat Nikodym agreed to take his doctoral examination at Warsaw University. It seems he did not care much for the title or publications - his response to\nSierpiÅski\n's persuasion was:-\nAm I going to be any wiser because of that?\nIn\n[\n2\n]\n, however, Danuta Ciesielska writes:-\nIt is commonly believed that it was\nSierpiÅski\nwho encouraged Otton to start publishing his results, but I am certain that is not the truth. The correspondence of the newly married couple with\nStanisÅawa\n's family presents the story in a different way. In my opinion,\nStanisÅawa\nand some friends from KrakÃ³w had far more impact on Otton than\nSierpiÅski\ndid.\nThe most likely would be that both are true - for several years\nSierpiÅski\nunsuccessfully tried to persuade Nikodym to register for a doctorate but he only agreed after his wife also encouraged him to register.\nStanisÅawa Nikodym\nwrote to her mother on\n26\nOctober\n1924\n(\nsee\n[\n2\n]\n)\n:-\n[\nOtton\n]\nsaid that he senses all the happiness coming to us together, including good health and his doctorate. It seems that his scientific success is constantly growing.\nSierpiÅski\nwrote that he communicated one of Otton's results to Professor\nAleksandrov\n(\nin Moscow\n)\n, who really admired it. ...\nSierpiÅski\nwrote that Professor\nFrÃ©chet\n, a very well-known French mathematician, asked him for Otton's address, because he wanted to send him an article in which his name is cited many times. Otton obtained many results that were later achieved by Professor\nFrÃ©chet\n, but he hid them in a drawer and communicated only some of them to\nTadeusz WaÅ¼ewski\n, who cited Otton in an article published in 'Comptes Rendus'. In this way,\nFrÃ©chet\nwas able to base his work on one of Otton's nice ideas.\nIn November\n1924\nthe Nikodyms moved to Warsaw and Otton Nikodym studied for his doctorate formally advised by\nSierpiÅski\n, although it is thought that he did not need an advisor. Although Nikodym had published no research papers up to this point, he had already achieved many impressive results as the above quote indicates. He was awarded his doctorate on\n26\nJune\n1925\nfor his thesis\nA Contribution to the Theory of A Sets\n(\nPolish\n)\n.\nAfter that he moved to the Jagiellonian University in KrakÃ³w and started to publish with two single author papers and one joint paper with\nSierpiÅski\n, all written in French, being published\n1925\n. The Nikodyms\n(\nOtton and his wife\nStanisÅawa\n)\nspent the academic year\n1925\n-\n26\nat the Sorbonne but it was a difficult year barely surviving on a very small Polish scholarship. After returning to Poland, on\n21\nJune\n1927\n, Otton obtained his habilitation at Warsaw University. He asked for his habilitation to be transferred to the Jagiellonian University which was approved on\n13\nMarch\n1028\n. In September\n1928\nhe participated in the International Congress of Mathematicians in Bologna, Italy and delivered the lecture\nSur le fondement des raisonnements locaux de l'analyse classique\nâ\n(\nOn the basis of local reasoning in classical analysis\n)\n. He began his lecture as follows:-\nIf we consider the case of real variables in classical analysis, we find two kinds of problems, theorems, definitions and reasonings: these are integral problems, theorems etc., and local problems, theorems etc. Here is an example:\nIf we are given a differential equation\nd\ny\nd\nx\n=\nf\n(\nx\n,\ny\n)\n\\Large\\frac{dy}{dx}\\normalsize  = f(x, y)\nd\nx\nd\ny\nâ\n=\nf\n(\nx\n,\ny\n)\nand a domain D in the\n(\nx, y\n)\n-plane and we propose to find integrals of this equation, as extended in D as possible, we are dealing with an integral problem.\nBut if we only suppose the existence of a neighbourhood of a given point\nx\n0\n,\ny\n0\nx^{0}, y^{0}\nx\n0\n,\ny\n0\nin which the function\nf\n(\nx\n,\ny\n)\nf(x, y)\nf\n(\nx\n,\ny\n)\nsatisfies certain conditions of regularity and we seek functions for which there exists a neighbourhood of\nx\n0\nx^{0}\nx\n0\nin which this function satisfies the given equation, we are dealing with a local problem.\nIntegral problems, theorems, and reasonings are related to a domain given in advance and considered in its entire extent, while local problems are related only to the neighbourhood of a point given in advance and it is in the nature of things that we do not need to know either the size or the precise form of this neighbourhood and it is only the pure existence of the neighbourhood that is the object of the problem. The same is true for theorems, definitions, and reasonings that can be integral or local. Differential calculus provides us at first sight with local theorems and, to obtain integral theorems, we need additional reasonings borrowed especially from topology. Now, I will only speak of local problems, theorems, definitions, and reasonings in the case of real variables.\nIn the period\n1930\n-\n1945\nthe Nikodyms lived in Warsaw and until the beginning of World War II both lectured at the University. During this period Nikodym published\n32\npapers and four textbooks. During World War II, the University of Warsaw was closed but the Nikodyms held secret classes, perfectly aware of the drastic consequences if the authorities had found out. Edward Ordman writes\n[\n12\n]\n:-\nDuring the war, of course, the German Nazis were fairly efficient at exterminating the Polish intelligentsia.Â  Nikodym and his wife escaped into the countryside, disguised as peasants. They were sheltered for the duration of the war in a small village, hidden and fed by the peasants. In exchange for being taken care of, they tutored the village children in arithmetic, and sometimes in other subjects, generally at the primary level.\nNikodym's name is mostly known in measure theory\n(\ne. g. the\nRadon\n-Nikodym theorem and derivative, the Nikodym convergence theorem, the Nikodym-\nGrothendieck\nboundedness theorem\n)\n, in functional analysis\n(\nthe\nRadon\n-Nikodym property of a\nBanach\nspace, the\nFrÃ©chet\n-Nikodym metric space, a Nikodym set\n)\n, projections onto convex sets with applications to\nDirichlet\nproblem, generalised solutions of differential equations, descriptive set theory and the foundations of quantum mechanics.\nThe\nRadon\n-Nikodym theorem\n(\nRadon\nproved it in\n1913\nfor\nR\nn\n\\mathbb{R}^{n}\nR\nn\nand Nikodym in\n1930\nfor the general case\n)\nis now a fundamental theorem in analysis:-\nLet\nÎ¼\n\\mu\nÎ¼\nbe a\nÏ\n\\sigma\nÏ\n-finite measure on a\nÏ\n\\sigma\nÏ\n-algebra\nÎ£\n\\Sigma\nÎ£\nof subsets of\nÎ©\n\\Omega\nÎ©\nand\nÎ½\n\\nu\nÎ½\na countably additive set function on\nÎ©\n\\Omega\nÎ©\n. If\nÎ½\n\\nu\nÎ½\nis absolutely continuous with respect to\nÎ¼\n\\mu\nÎ¼\n: that is,\nÎ¼\n(\nA\n)\n=\n0\n\\mu(A) = 0\nÎ¼\n(\nA\n)\n=\n0\nimplies\nÎ½\n(\nA\n)\n=\n0\n\\nu(A) = 0\nÎ½\n(\nA\n)\n=\n0\n, then\nÎ½\n(\nA\n)\n=\nâ«\nA\nf\nd\nÎ¼\n\\nu(A) = \\int _{A}f d\\mu\nÎ½\n(\nA\n)\n=\nâ«\nA\nâ\nf\nd\nÎ¼\nfor any\nA\nâ\nÎ£\nA \\in  \\Sigma\nA\nâ\nÎ£\n, where\nf\nf\nf\nis locally integrable on\nÎ©\n\\Omega\nÎ©\n.\nNikodym showed in\n1927\nhow to produce a subset\nN\nN\nN\nof the unit square with area\n(\nN\n)\n=\n1\nsuch that for each point\nx\nâ\nN\nx \\in  N\nx\nâ\nN\nthere is a line intersecting\nN\nN\nN\nin the single point\nx\nx\nx\n. This paradoxical set in the plane, which for certain problems plays a role similar to\nBesicovitch\nsets, is called a\nNikodym set\n.\nIn\n1945\nNikodym became a professor at the Technical University of KrakÃ³w and in academic year\n1945\n-\n46\ntaught mathematics. In\n1946\nOtton Nikodym and his wife\nStanisÅawa Nikodym\nwent first for Belgium and then to France where he began his work on the mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics. The couple went from France to London, England, where they attended a conference. William Transue, from Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio, USA was at the conference and, when he heard that Nikodym wanted to stay in the West, said he would try to get him a job offer from his College. Transue contacted the President of Kenyon College who quickly sent Nikodym the offer of a position at the College. Nikodym and his wife sailed from Southampton to New York on the\nMarine Flasher\nleaving Southampton on\n21\nMarch\n1948\nand arriving in New York on\n31\nMarch. On his entry to the United States Nikodym declared his final destination to be Gambier, Ohio, that he intended to apply for American citizenship and become a permanent resident. His entry record contains the following details: Height,\n5\nft\n5\nin; Hair Colour, Grey; Eye Colour, Brown; Complexion, Medium. It is not known for certain why he decided to emigrate at this time but those who knew him believed it was because he did not want to live in a Poland controlled by the Soviets.\nFrom\n1948\nto\n1965\nhe worked in the United States at the private Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio. He became a U.S. citizen on\n29\nJune\n1953\nand continued to teach at Kenyon College. Edward Ordman writes\n[\n12\n]\n:-\nIn the early days\n[\nat Kenyon College\n]\nthe Nikodyms went to class together; he lectured from a prepared text and she helped field the questions.Â  They were a dramatic contrast to the usual inhabitants of central Ohio, moving together through this strange culture and language.Â  The small college town was a big help: there was usually someone who could translate, by way of French or German, if there was difficulty communicating in the butcher shop or at the barber, and the shopkeepers knew the college would straighten out any problems By a few years later, his English had improved enough to manage questions himself and his wife no longer needed to attend his classes.\nBy the time I was a student at Kenyon and took a course from Nikodym\n(\nan introduction to\nHilbert\nSpace, using the text by\nHalmos\n)\nin the early\n1960\n's, he was in his eighties.Â  A small man, somewhat stooped over, he was driven to work every morning by his wife. She followed two paces behind as he walked to his office, removed his coat for him and hung it up, then went home until she returned for him in the evening.Â  A sweet, soft spoken man, he still lectured from a prepared text but his English was limited and we often had to phrase our questions in French and German, a good experience for us students but it generally restricted his enrolment to senior maths majors planning to attend graduate school, not a large number of people in this small college which then had about\n800\nstudents.Â  A high point of our undergraduate education was being invited home for dinner at the Nikodym home. It was a small but elegant apartment carved from a large house on aÂ  hilltop owned by the college, built well over a century ago as the palace of the then Episcopal Bishop of Ohio.Â\nMrs Nikodym\nserved what seemed to us a very European dinner, and with some prompting from her husband told of their earlier lives and especially their hiding out during the Second World War.\nAfter he retired, the Nikodyms moved in\n1966\nto Utica, New York, where he continued his research, sponsored in part by the Atomic Energy Commission and National Science Foundation.\nAfter\n1947\nhe wrote about\n50\nresearch papers. He lectured in Italy, Belgium, France, England, Germany, Romania, Canada and at universities in USA. In\n1965\nhe was invited for a semester by the University of Naples, Italy, to lecture on measure theory.\nNikodym wrote three volumes of\nDidactics of pure mathematics in high school\nbut published only the two first volumes in\n1930\nand\n1938\n. He was discouraged by the poor response of teachers to his popular methods of improving teaching and so he burned the manuscript of the third volume. He presented popular lectures on radio such as:\nLogic and intuition in science\n,\nOn infinity\n,\nOn paradoxes in logic\n,\nWhat good is algebra?\n,\nOn different kinds of spaces\n,\nThe mystery of gravitation\n,\nOn the importance of theory\nand these were published in\n1946\nas a book\nLet's look deeply inside the mind\n[\nSpojrzmy w glebiny mysli\n]\n.\nSome of his other books were:\nIntroduction to differential calculus\n(\nWarsaw,\n1936)\n(\njointly with his wife\nStanisÅawa Nikodym\n)\n,\nTheory of tensors with applications to geometry and mathematical physics\n1\n(\nWarsaw,\n1938)\n, and\nDifferential Equations\n(\nPoznaÅ,\n1949)\n.\nThree of his other books, the second volume of\nTheory of Tensors\nand two volumes of\nMechanics,\ndisappeared during World War II. When Nikodym heard that his many years' work were lost he only said:-\nIn that case I will not have to correct the galley-proofs.\nOn the question of whether he would like to write these books again, he answered:-\nThere are so many new problems that I cannot spend more time on those that I have already finished.\nHis last book\nThe Mathematical Apparatus for Quantum-Theories, based on the Theory of Boolean Lattices\npublished in\n1966\nby Springer-Verlag contains, on almost thousand pages, the mathematical formalism for quantum mechanics or more precisely a detailed study of the Boolean subalgebras of the logic of closed subspaces of a complex\nHilbert\nspace.\nAlicja Derkowska writes in\n[\n7\n]\n:-\nNikodym was a very demanding man - both towards himself and others. Perhaps that is why not everyone liked him. ... He always set himself ambitious scientific goals, liked to struggle with difficult problems and persistently worked for years to solve them.\nEugen P Nassar writes in\n[\n11\n]\n:-\nHe despised what he called careerism: he despised fame-hungry scientists who, in order to advance, play politics in universities and in government. He also despised what he called sham - any pretence of greatness not based on honest truth. ... I remember vividly some of his sayings, for example: - An honest shopkeeper is worth much more than a pretend scientist; - Beware of the \"happy-makers.\" They are usually unhappy themselves and bring misfortune to others; - Work is a reward and pleasure for those few who understand it, all the rest are careerists. And yet a person is quite happy with family, home, friends, a few beautiful things around him, creative work at his desk and health. Applause is unnecessary.\nNikodym read books on biology, chemistry or medicine, liked good literature and fairy-tales, which he believed developed imagination, but mostly he loved music. He was able to play for hours on the piano. He loved Chopin, admired Wagner's operas, and highly valued classical and romantic composers. He knew\n(\napart from Polish\n)\nEnglish, French, German and Italian. He lectured in all these languages but struggled with English.\nWhen the National Science Foundation in the USA asked him what to do to raise the level of mathematics in USA, he answered:-\nWe should invite lecturer-enthusiasts since enthusiasm is infectious.\nHe himself was full of enthusiasm until the end of his life.\nIn\n1971\nhe suffered a stroke and for two years and ten months did not regain consciousness. He died on\n3\nMay\n1974\nand he was buried in the \"cemetery for the meritorious\" in Doylestown, Pennsylvania\n(\nat the shrine to Our Lady of Czestochowa\n)\n. His tombstone, decorated with a colourful mosaic of flowers, was designed by his wife. After his death Nelson Dunford wrote in the letter to Nikodym's wife:-\nOtton was, and always will be, a great man. I am happy that I knew him. His discoveries were very deep and will live for ever as long as\nPythagoras\n's theorem, which has survived for centuries.",
