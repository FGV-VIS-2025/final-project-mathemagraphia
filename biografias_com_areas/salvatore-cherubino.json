  "biografia": "Salvatore Cherubino\n's parents were Alessandro Cherubino and Stella Europeo. The family was not well-off and could not afford to give their son Salvatore the solid education that his talents clearly deserved. He graduated from middle school in\n1903\n, having shown considerable mathematical talents, and entered a technical school but, through lack of financial support, was forced to give up his studies shortly after he had enrolled. Having to earn a living, he began a clerical career taking a job in the Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs. He lived as cheaply as he possibly could while trying to save enough money to allow him to begin a university education.\nIn\n1905\n, after a couple of years of sacrifices, he enrolled at the University of Naples to study mathematics. He graduated with a doctorate in pure mathematics in\n1909\n. He had studied the theory of groups of substitutions for his thesis, publishing two papers on the topic in\n1909\n, namely\nSulle generatrici del gruppo alterno delle sostituzioni di n elementi\nâ\n(\nOn generating the alternating group on n elements by transpositions\n)\nand, related to\nSylow\n's theorem,\nAlcune formule aritmetiche e loro applicazioni nella teoria dei gruppi di sostituzioni\nâ\n(\nSome arithmetic formulas and their applications in the theory of groups of substitutions\n)\n. Considered an exceptional student, he was appointed as an assistant to the professor of analytic geometry at the University of Naples for the year\n1910\n-\n1911\n.\nErnesto Pascal\nhad been appointed to the chair of Complementary Algebra and Higher Analysis at the University of Naples in\n1907\n. Immediately after he graduated, Cherubino attended a course given by\nPascal\non classical binary forms. In this course\nPascal\ndescribed his own contributions to the topic as well as the work being published by\nAlfred Clebsch\n. This led to Cherubino publishing the paper\nAmpliamento di un sistema completo alle cui forme fondamentali si aggreghi una nuova forma di ordine n\nâ\n(\nAddition of a complete system to whose basic forms aggregates is a new form of order n\n)\n(1911)\nin Battaglini's\nGiornale di matematiche\n. He began teaching at secondary school level in\n1911\n, winning three competitions for posts in that year. He was appointed to teach at the Women's Normal School at Siena in\n1911\n, but in the following year, after winning another competition, he moved to Padua where again he taught in a secondary school. At Padua, however, he was able to become involved with the mathematics department at the university where there were three outstanding professors. These were\nGiuseppe Veronese\n, who held the Chair of\nAlgebraic Geometry\n,\nTullio Levi-Civita\n, who had been appointed to the Chair of Rational Mechanics in\n1898\n, a post which he held for\n20\nyears, and\nFrancesco Severi\n, who had been appointed to the Chair of Projective and Descriptive Geometry in\n1905\n. Cherubino was awarded a government scholarship for advanced study which allowed him to attend the courses of\nLevi-Civita\nand\nVeronese\nwhile, advised by\nSeveri\n, he devoted himself to the study of algebraic geometry. This led to Cherubino publishing\nSulle curve iperellittiche con trasformazioni birazionali singolari in sÃ© e sui loro moduli algebrici\nâ\n(\nOn hyperelliptic curves with singular birational transformations in themselves and their algebraic forms\n)\n(1913\n-\n14)\n.\nIn\n1913\nCherubino was appointed as an assistant to the Chair of Infinitesimal Calculus at the University of Naples but he continued to teach in secondary schools. However, his career was interrupted by the outbreak of World War I. In\n1914\n, when Cherubino was teaching in Naples, World War I broke out but, shortly after hostilities began on\n3\nAugust, Italy declared that it would not commit troops to the fighting. This was despite having an alliance with Germany and Austria-Hungary. Italy revoked this alliance on\n3\nMay\n1915\nand later that month declared war on Austria-Hungary. Cherubino was drafted into the military, first as a private soldier and then, at his request, as an officer in the Territorial Militia where he served as an telegraphic engineer. In\n1918\nhe was sent in the\n28\nth\nTelegraph Company of the XII Corps of the\n6\nth\nArmy to fight in the Altipiani campaign. The\n6\nth\nArmy fought in the Battle of the Piave in June\n1918\n. This battle was the result of a final push by the Austro-Hungarian forces attempting to take the positions of the Allies\n(58\nItalian Divisions alongside\n3\nBritish and\n2\nFrench Divisions\n)\nacross the river Piave. Many died on both sides but the Austro-Hungarian forces were so depleted that they never able to mount another major offensive. Cherubino remained with his unit until the end of the war. When he was released from military duties, he was able to return to his two positions in Naples as a secondary school teacher and as an assistant at the university.\nAt Naples, Cherubino was influenced by\nGaetano Scorza\nwho taught at the University of Naples from\n1920\nto\n1934\n. Of course, he was returning to the city where he had studied as an undergraduate and studied with\nErnesto Pascal\nin the year following his graduation. Cherubino was again influenced by\nPascal\nand he began to undertake research on a new topic, publishing\nSulle varietÃ  abeliane reali e sulle matrici di Riemann reali\nâ\n(\nOn Abelian  real varieties and real Riemann matrices\n)\nin\n1922\n. However, Cherubino now studied Civil Engineering and was awarded his laurea in that topic in\n1923\nand began lecturing in mathematics at the industrial technical institute in Naples. In the following year he taught at the Art School attached to the Academy of Fine Arts in Naples. Continuing to work in that city, he taught analysis and descriptive, analytic and projective geometry at the Air Force Academy in\n1926\n. He gave courses on infinitesimal calculus at the School of Architecture in the academic year\n1927\n-\n28\n. He was the appointed as Deputy Director of the School of Architecture in Naples, a position he held from\n1928\nto\n1933\n. Cherubino published several important memoirs on matrix theory around this time such as\nLe matrici riemanniane sottonormali\n(1927)\n,\nLe matrici caratteristiche delle simmetrie sulle varietÃ  abeliane reali\nâ\n(\nThe matrices characteristics of symmetries on the real Abelian varieties\n)\n(1928)\nand\nUna applicazione del calcolo delle matrici alla teoria delle forme quadratiche\nâ\n(\nAn application of the calculation of the matrices to the theory of quadratic forms\n)\n(1929)\n. In\n1933\n, approaching the age of fifty, Cherubino won the competition for the Chair of Analytical, Projective and Descriptive Geometry and Drawing at the University of Messina. He only held this chair for two years before moving to Pisa in\n1935\nto an ordinary professorship in geometry. He continued to hold this chair at Pisa until he retired in\n1955\n. His lectures at Pisa were the basis for his textbook\nLezioni di geometria analitica con elementi di proiettiva\nwhich he published in\n1940\n. He also published the paper\nIdentitÃ  birazionale di due curve algebriche\nâ\n(\nBirational identity of two algebraic curves\n)\nin\n1939\nwhich also was based on his teaching. T R Hollcroft writes in a review:-\nIn the preface it is stated that this paper was originally intended for the use of the author's students in the University of Pisa. It is a compendium with numerous references to the work of several mathematicians. It deals chiefly with the conditions for the birational identity of two algebraic curves. In the last two sections, curves with the same Jacobian variety are treated. The work is often more detailed and in some places more precise than in the original papers.\nAfter retiring, Cherubino published the monograph\nCalcolo dell Matrici\nâ\n(\nCalculation of matrices\n)\n(1957)\n.\nC C MacDuffee\nwrites in a review\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nThe reviewer read this book with a great deal of pleasure because it is different from most of the books on matrices which are currently appearing. While the concept of vector space is introduced, it is not used very much. The reduction to canonical form under similarity transformations is limited to the field of the characteristic roots. A paragraph entitled \"the concepts of abstract algebra\" consists essentially of the derivation of the first and second regular representations of a finite linear associative algebra. The concepts of ring and field are introduced, but most of the book is concerned with matrices with either real or complex elements. There is really a lot of factual material in this book, much of it not readily accessible in textbooks. The chapters dealing with the characteristic roots are especially complete, treating approximation to the dominant root,\nHurwitz\n's stability theorem, maxima and minima of quadratic forms,\nBorchardt\n's theorem, bounds for the roots, etc. But the author's principal interest seems to be in the differentiation and integration of matrices whose elements are functions of one or more independent variables. Even the\nCayley\n-\nHamilton\ntheorem is proved by a power series expansion.\nWe should also mention that Cherubino did some work on probability theory, for example he published a work on\nprobability\nsuggested by the theory of gases\nUna quistione di probabilitÃ  suggerita dalla teoria dei gas\nâ\n(\nA question of probability suggested by the theory of gases\n)\n(1923)\n. He also wrote a number of articles on economics and published the book\nEconomia matematica\nâ\n(\nMathematical economics\n)\n. He was invited to give the talk\nSui polinomi definiti o semidefiniti\nâ\n(\nOn  definite or semidefinite polynomials\n)\nat the International Congress of Mathematicians at Bologna in\n1928\nand he published a paper of the same title in the Proceedings of the Congress.\nMaria Passaquindici, who was a student of Cherubino's, gives this tribute in the obituary\n[\n3\n]\n:-\nA man of vast culture, with which he combined a strict scientific training, he brought to everything the contribution of his competence and of his moral rectitude, and received due recognition with the gold medal high for quality teaching, culture and art which he received on the occasion of the inauguration of the Academic Year on\n21\nJanuary\n1961\n. He devoted much of his energies and his time to teaching and his loss is a great one for the world of culture and especially of research. ... His work was carried out quietly and modestly, without elaborate language and without exhibition, simply enjoying the satisfaction that he had given with the work he had done. He struck us with his generosity at being always available to students and all those who turned to him: how much patience he showed in reviewing our work which he undertook and how long he spent in valuable open conversation on all topics! His noble figure and his tireless scientific work deserve a better illustration. He was to me an advisor and teacher who cultivated attachment, gratitude and devotion which he reciprocated with love, understanding and kindness. The memory of Salvatore Cherubino remains deep in the hearts of all his students and we regret losing his counsel but we are committed to follow his example. He left a great legacy of love because he was very good, just and honest, he had a deep sense of humanity and a broad understanding towards his students, for whom he worked until the last days of his long and laborious life. I will always remember with gratitude and admiration the University of Pisa, which honoured him for his talent and his contribution. We students, mourning the loss of his friendship, give a heartfelt tribute to the Master, reverent homage to the scientist and devout thanksgiving for the man, as we work to continue, even though unworthily, with his interrupted work.\nAs well as the gold medal which Passaquindici mentions, Cherubino was honoured with election to the Accademia Pontaniana di Napoli in\n1928\nand to the Accademia\nLeonardo da Vinci\ndi Napoli in\n1932\n. In the same year he was elected to the Accademia Peloritana di Catania.",
