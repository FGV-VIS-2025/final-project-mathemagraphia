  "biografia": "Claude Dechales\nbecame a Jesuit at the age of\n15\nand was educated within the Jesuit Order. The Jesuit Order had been created about eighty years before Dechales was born and from the very beginning education and scholarship became the principal work of the Order. By the time Dechales entered the Order it contained over\n16\n,\n000\nmen. The main task of the Jesuits was education, but the next most important task was missionary work throughout Europe, Asia, and Africa. Dechales participated in these two major roles of the Jesuits, for in addition to a life spent in education, he was, for a time, a Jesuit missionary in Turkey.\nDechales lectured at Jesuit colleges, first in Paris where for four years he taught at the CollÃ¨ge de Clermont, then at he taught at Colleges in Lyon and ChambÃ©ry. From ChambÃ©ry he went to Marseilles where King Louis XIV appointed him Royal Professor of Hydrography. In Marseilles he taught navigation, military engineering and other applications of mathematics. From Marseilles he moved to Turin where he was appointed professor of mathematics.\nDechales is best remembered for\nCursus seu mundus mathematicus\nâ\n(\nA complete course of mathematics\n)\npublished in Lyon in\n1674\n, a complete course of mathematics. Topics covered in this wide ranging work included practical geometry, mechanics, statics, magnetism and optics as well as topics outwith the usual topics of mathematics such as geography, architecture, astronomy, natural philosophy and music. Nardi writes\n[\n5\n]\n:-\nDechales adopted\nGalileo\n's theory of motion, where he introduced several original views and developments. He attaches a preponderant significance to the experimental foundation of\nGalileo\n's main theorems and, in his opinion, the proportionality of velocity and time is first an expression of Nature\n(\nex natura rei\n)\n, then a logical assignment. Dechales anticipates some aspects of\nNewton\n's natural philosophy by emphasising questions depending on dynamics such as the concept of gravity\n(\nrelated to the free fall of bodies\n)\nand the mathematical treatment of air friction. ... Dechales'\n[\noffers\n]\napology of\nGalileo\n's times-squared law of uniformly accelerated motion, which is maintained by Dechales in opposition to rival explanatory attempts developed - or even simply proposed - by contemporary scientists like the Jesuit professors\nFabri\nand Le Cazre ...\nThe book was widely used but it reflects his ability to teach rather than a research ability and fails to use the mathematical advances of the day. It is old-fashioned in its coverage: in algebra, for example, it owes more to\nDiophantus\nthan to the algebraists of its day. Hutton wrote that the book:-\n... is of a very old-fashioned sort, considering the time when it was written.\nAs\nMoritz Cantor\npoints out in\n[\n3\n]\nDechales rarely mentions the work of\nMydorge\n,\nDesargues\n,\nPascal\n,\nFermat\n,\nDescartes\n, or\nWallis\n[\n1\n]\n:-\n... while according Dechales due credit for his efforts, Cantor is nevertheless critical of much of the mathematical content of his work, deploring Dechales's failure to make full use of such available contemporary source materials as the first-hand works of mathematicians, their correspondence, and so on.\nOther work by Dechales included\nL'art de fortifier, de dÃ©fendre et d'attaquer les places, suivant les mÃ©thodes franÃ§oises, hollandoises, italiennes et espagnoles\nâ\n(\ndefending and attacking places, according to the French, Dutch, Italian and Spanish\n)\n(\nParis,\n1677)\n, and\nL'art de naviger demontrÃ© par principes et confirmÃ© par plusieurs observations tirÃ©es de l'experience\nâ\n(\nThe art of navigation demonstrated by principles and confirmed by several observations from experience\n)\n(\nParis,\n1677)\n. In\n1678\nhe published in Lausanne his edition of\nEuclid\n,\nThe Elements of Euclid Explained in a New but Most Easy Method: Together with the Use of Every Proposition through All Parts of the Mathematics, written in French by That Most Excellent Mathematician, F Claude Francis Milliet Dechales of the Society of Jesus\n. This work covers Books\n1\nto\n6\n, together with Books\n11\nand\n12\n, of\nEuclid\n's\nElements\n. A second edition was published in\n1683\n, then an edition revised by\nOzanam\nwas published in Paris in\n1753\n. An English translation was published in London by M Gillyflower and W Freeman, the translation being by Reeve Williams. A second edition of this English translation appeared in\n1696\n. Schaap writes\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nDechales's separate edition of\nEuclid\n, long a favourite in France and elsewhere on the Continent, never became popular in England.",
