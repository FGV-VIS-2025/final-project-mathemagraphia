  "biografia": "Jean d'Alembert\n's father was an artillery officer, Louis-Camus Destouches and his mother was Mme de Tencin. She had been a nun but had received a papal dispensation in\n1714\nwhich allowed her to begin\n[\n4\n]\n:-\n... a brilliant social career in which political intrigues and amorous liaisons contended for first place; a timely participation in the famous John Law Scheme allowed her to pursue these activities in complete financial security.\n[\nJohn Law was a Scottish monetary reformer who founded a bank in Paris in\n1716\nwith authority to issue notes. It was highly successful at first, the time when Mme de Tencin made her money, but collapsed in\n1720\n.\n]\nD'Alembert was the illegitimate son from one of Mme de Tencin 'amorous liaisons'. His father, Louis-Camus Destouches, was out of the country at the time of d'Alembert's birth and his mother left the newly born child on the steps of the church of St Jean Le Rond. The child was quickly found and taken to a home for homeless children. He was baptised Jean Le Rond, named after the church on whose steps he had been found.\nWhen his father returned to Paris he made contact with his young son and arranged for him to be cared for by the wife of a glazier, Mme Rousseau. She would always be d'Alembert's mother in his own eyes, particularly since his real mother never recognised him as her son, and he lived in Mme Rousseau's house until he was middle-aged.\nThe first school that d'Alembert attended was a private school, his education being arranged by his father. His father died in\n1726\nwhen d'Alembert was nine years old and he left him just enough money to give him security. The Destouches family continued to look after d'Alembert's education and they arranged for him to enter the Jansenist CollÃ¨ge des Quatre Nations. He enrolled in the name of Jean-Baptiste Daremberg but soon changed his name to Jean d'Alembert.\nThe CollÃ¨ge des Quatre Nations was an excellent place for d'Alembert to study mathematics even though the course was elementary. The mathematics course, given by Professor Carron, was based on\nVarignon\n's lectures and d'Alembert was able to make use of the excellent mathematics library at the CollÃ¨ge. As well as the mathematical training, he learnt about\nDescartes\n' physical ideas at the CollÃ¨ge but, when he formed his own ideas later in his life, he would have little respect for the views of\nDescartes\n.\nThe main aim of the Jansenist CollÃ¨ge des Quatre Nations was to produce scholars who could become experts in theology and argue the Jansenist case against the Jesuits. However, d'Alembert was turned off the study of theology at the CollÃ¨ge. After graduating in\n1735\nhe decided that he would make a career in law but his real passion was for mathematics and he continued to work in his spare time on that subject. In\n1738\nd'Alembert qualified as an advocate but he seems to have decided that this was not the career for him. The following year d'Alembert studied medicine but this was a topic that he found even worse than theology. Of all the topics he had studied the one that he had real enthusiasm for was mathematics and his progress in this was quite remarkable, particularly given that he had studied almost exclusively on his own and at a time when he was supposed to be studying for other qualifications.\nIn July\n1739\nd'Alembert read his first paper to the\nParis Academy of Science\non some errors he had found in\nReyneau\n's standard text\nAnalyse dÃ©montrÃ©e\nâ\n(\nAnalysis demonstrated\n)\nwhich were not of great significance but marked the start of his mathematical career. In\n1740\nhe submitted a second work on the mechanics of fluids which was praised by\nClairaut\n. In May\n1741\nd'Alembert was admitted to the\nParis Academy of Science\n, on the strength of these and papers on the integral calculus. It took some determination on his part, submitting three unsuccessful applications in quick succession, before his appointment.\nBefore discussing d'Alembert's contributions it is useful to discuss his personality, which was to have a major effect on the way his scientific work was to develop. In one sense d'Alembert's life was uneventful. He travelled little and worked at the\nParis Academy of Science\nand the French Academy all his life. On another level his life was one of great drama as he argued with almost everyone around him. As stated in\n[\n5\n]\n:-\nD'Alembert was always surrounded by controversy. ... he was a lightning rod which drew sparks from all the foes of the philosophes. ... Unfortunately he carried this... pugnacity into his scientific research and once he had entered a controversy, he argued his cause with vigour and stubbornness. He closed his mind to the possibility that he might be wrong...\nDespite this tendency to quarrel with all around him, his contributions were truly outstanding. D'Alembert helped to resolve the controversy in mathematical physics over the conservation of kinetic energy by improving\nNewton\n's definition of force in his\nTraitÃ© de dynamique\nâ\n(\nTreatise on dynamics\n)\nwhich he published in\n1743\n. This also contains d'Alembert's principle of mechanics. This is an important work and the preface contains a clear statement by d'Alembert of an attempt to lay a firm foundation for mechanics. In\n[\n5\n]\nd'Alembert's ideas, as presented in this preface, are described:-\n... d'Alembert was a mathematician, not a physicist, and he believed mechanics was just as much a part of mathematics as geometry or algebra. Rational mechanics was a science based on simple necessary principles from which all particular phenomenon could be deduced by rigorous mathematical methods. ... d'Alembert thought mechanics should be made into a completely rationalistic mathematical system.\nD'Alembert had begun to read parts of his\nTraitÃ© de dynamique\nto the Academy in late\n1742\nbut soon afterwards\nClairaut\nbegan to read his own work on dynamics to the Academy. Clearly a rivalry quickly sprung up and d'Alembert stopped reading the work to the Academy and rushed into print with the treatise. The two mathematicians had come up with similar ideas and indeed the rivalry was to become considerably worse in the next few years.\nD'Alembert stated his position clearly that he believed mechanics to be based on metaphysical principles and not on experimental evidence. He seems not to have realised in his reading of\nNewton\n's\nPrincipia\nhow strongly\nNewton\nbased his laws of motion on experimental evidence. For d'Alembert these laws of motion were logical necessities.\nIn\n1744\nd'Alembert applied his results to the equilibrium and motion of fluids and published\nTraitÃ© de l'Ã©quilibre et du mouvement des fluides\nâ\n(\nTreatise on the equilibrium and motion of fluids\n)\n. This work gave an alternative treatment of fluids to the one published by\nDaniel Bernoulli\n. D'Alembert thought it a better approach, of course, as one might expect,\nDaniel Bernoulli\ndid not share this view.\nD'Alembert became unhappy at the\nParis Academy\n, almost certainly because of his rivalry with\nClairaut\nand disagreements with others. His position became even less happy in\n1745\nwhen\nMaupertuis\nleft Paris to take up the post of head of the\nBerlin Academy\nwhere, at that time,\nEuler\nwas working.\nIn around\n1746\nd'Alembert's life took a rather sudden change. This is described in\n[\n4\n]\nas follows:-\nUntil\n[1746]\nhe had been satisfied to lead a retired but mentally active existence at the house of his foster-mother. In\n1746\nhe was introduced to Mme Geoffrin, the rich, imperious, unintellectual but generous founder of a salon to which d'Alembert was suddenly invited. He soon entered a social life in which, surprisingly enough, he began to enjoy great success and popularity.\nAround the same time d'Alembert began to become involved in a major project, namely editing the\nEncyclopÃ©die\nwith Diderot. He was contracted as an editor to cover mathematics and physical astronomy but his work covered a wider field. When the first volume appeared in\n1751\nit contained a Preface written by d'Alembert which was widely acclaimed as a work of great genius. Buffon said that:-\nIt is the quintessence of human knowledge...\nD'Alembert worked on the\nEncyclopÃ©die\nfor many years. In fact he wrote most of the mathematical articles in this\n28\nvolume work. However, he continued his mathematical work while working on the\nEncyclopÃ©die\n. He was a pioneer in the study of\npartial differential equations\nand he pioneered their use in physics. His work on this topic first appeared in an article which he submitted for the\n1747\nprize of the\nBerlin Academy\nRÃ©flexions sur la cause gÃ©nÃ©rale des vents\nâ\n(\nReflections on the general cause of the winds\n)\nwhich indeed he won the prize.\nEuler\n, however, saw the power of the methods introduced by d'Alembert and soon developed these far further than had d'Alembert. In fact this work by d'Alembert on the winds suffers from a defect which was typical of all of his work, namely it was mathematically very sound but was based on rather poor physical evidence. In this case, for example, d'Alembert assumed that the winds were generated by tidal effects on the atmosphere and heating of the atmosphere played only a very minor role.\nClairaut\nattacked d'Alembert's methods\n[\n5\n]\n:-\nIn order to avoid delicate experiments or long tedious calculations, in order to substitute analytical methods which cost them less trouble, they often make hypotheses which have no place in nature; they pursue theories that are foreign to their object, whereas a little constancy in the execution of a perfectly simple method would have surely brought them to their goal.\nA heated argument between d'Alembert and\nClairaut\nresulted in the two fine mathematicians trading insults in the scientific journals of the day.\nThe year\n1747\nwas an important one for d'Alembert in that a second important work of his appeared in that year, namely his article on vibrating strings. The article contains the first appearance of the wave equation in print but again suffers from the defect that he used mathematically pleasing simplifications of certain\nboundary conditions\nwhich led to results which were at odds with observation.\nEuler\nhad learnt of d'Alembert's work in around\n1743\nthrough letters from\nDaniel Bernoulli\n. However,\nDaniel Bernoulli\nbecame highly critical of d'Alembert after reading his\nTraitÃ© de l'Ã©quilibre et du mouvement des fluides\nâ\n(\nTreatise on the equilibrium and motion of fluids\n)\nfor reasons we noted above. When d'Alembert won the prize of the\nBerlin Academy of Sciences\nwith his essay on winds he produced a work which\nEuler\nconsidered superior to that of\nDaniel Bernoulli\n. Certainly at this time\nEuler\nand d'Alembert were on very good terms with\nEuler\nhaving high respect for d'Alembert's work and the two corresponded on many topics of mutual interest.\nHowever relations between\nEuler\nand d'Alembert soon took a turn for the worse after the dispute in the\nBerlin Academy\ninvolving\nSamuel KÃ¶nig\nwhich began in\n1751\n. The situation became more relevant to d'Alembert in\n1752\nwhen he was invited to became President of the\nBerlin Academy\n. Another reason for d'Alembert to feel angry with\nEuler\nwas that he felt that\nEuler\nwas stealing his ideas and not giving him due credit. In one sense d'Alembert was justified but on the other hand his work was usually so muddled that\nEuler\ncould not follow it and resorted to starting from scratch to clarify the problem being solved.\nThe\nParis Academy\nhad not been a place for d'Alembert to publish after he fell out with colleagues there and he was sending his mathematical papers to the\nBerlin Academy\nduring the\n1750\ns. However\nEuler\nwas unhappy to publish these works and d'Alembert stopped publishing his mathematical articles, collecting them together and publishing them as\nOpuscules mathÃ©matiques\nâ\n(\nBooklets on mathematics\n)\nwhich appeared in eight volumes between\n1761\nand\n1780\n.\nAgain Frederick II, the King of Prussia, tried to persuade d'Alembert to accept the presidency of the\nBerlin Academy\n.\nEuler\nwas strongly opposed to this and wrote to Lagrange\n(\nsee\n[\n5\n]\n)\n:-\n... d'Alembert has tried to undermine\n[\nmy solution to the vibrating strings problem\n]\nby various cavils, and that for the sole reason that he did not get it himself. ... He thinks he can deceive the semi-learned by his eloquence. ... He wished to publish in our journal not a proof, but a bare statement that my solution is defective. ... From this you can judge what an uproar he would let loose if he were to become our president.\nEuler\nneed not have feared however, for d'Alembert visited Frederick II for three months in\n1764\n, turned down the offer of the presidency again, and tried to persuade Frederick II to made\nEuler\npresident. This was not the only offer d'Alembert turned down. He also turned down an invitation from Catherine II to go to Russia as a tutor for her son.\nD'Alembert made other important contributions to mathematics which we have not yet mentioned. In an article entitled\nDiffÃ©rentiel\nin volume\n4\nof\nEncyclopÃ©die\nwritten in\n1754\n, he suggested that the theory of limits be put on a firm foundation. He was one of the first to understand the importance of functions and, in this article, he defined the derivative of a function as the limit of a quotient of increments. His ideas on limits led him to the test for convergence, known today as d'Alembert's ratio test, which appears in Volume\n5\nof\nOpuscules mathÃ©matiques\nâ\n(\nBooklets on mathematics\n)\n.\nIn the latter part of his life d'Alembert turned more towards literature and philosophy. D'Alembert's philosophical works appear mainly in the five volume work\nMÃ©langes de littÃ©rature et de philosophie\nâ\n(\nMixtures of literature and philosophy\n)\nwhich appeared between\n1753\nand\n1767\n. In this work he sets out his skepticism concerning metaphysical problems. He accepts the argument in favour of the existence of God, based on the belief that intelligence cannot be a product of matter alone. However, although he took this public view in his books, evidence from his friends showed that he was persuaded by Diderot towards materialism before\n1770\n.\nD'Alembert was elected to the French Academy on\n28\nNovember\n1754\n. In\n1772\nhe was elected perpetual secretary of the French Academy and spent much time writing obituaries for the academy\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nHe became the academy's most influential member, but, in spite of his efforts, that body failed to produce anything noteworthy in the way of literature during his pre-eminence.\nD'Alembert complained from\n1765\n, after a bout of illness, that his mind was no longer able to concentrate on mathematics. In\n1777\n, in a letter to\nLagrange\n, he showed how much he regretted this:-\nWhat annoys me the most is the fact that geometry, which is the only occupation that truly interests me, is the one thing that I cannot do. All that I do in literature, although very well received in our public sessions of the French Academy, is for me only a way to fill the time for lack of anything better to do.\nHe suffered bad health for many years and his death was as the result of a bladder illness. As a known unbeliever, d'Alembert was buried in a common unmarked grave.",
