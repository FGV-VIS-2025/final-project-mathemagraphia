  "biografia": "Grigore Moisil\n's father, Constantin Moisil, was a historian and member of the\nRomanian Academy of Sciences\n. Grigore was named after his grandfather, Constantin's father, who had been a clergyman but died a few years before his grandson was born. Constantin was married to Elena who was an elementary school teacher in Tulcea, but later she became the director of the \"Maidanul Dulapului\" school in Bucharest. Marcus, in\n[\n14\n]\n, describes what Grigore, the subject of this biography, was like as a child:-\nThe child Grigore enjoyed to look around, to give free expression to his curiosity and wonder, to ask questions, to read books of a large diversity from science and literature and from practical jobs to philosophy. He felt always the need to react to what he was seeing, listening and reading. His diary is an excellent mirror of this fact. His main pleasure was always of an intellectual nature, he was not attracted to play with other children or to practise various sports of games. His mother taught him to count and to make calculations and only as a second step to read and write. The most important part of the learning process took place at his home, with his parents and sometimes with his brothers and his sister, all of them becoming intellectuals.\nCertainly learning at home was important, but Grigore attended primary school in Bucharest, where his family had moved. He entered high school in\n1916\n, first in Vaslui, then at the \"Spiru Haret\" high school in Bucharest. Mathematics was the most important subject for him during his school years but his great passion for the subject did not stop him enjoying and excelling in all the other subjects he studied at school. He graduated from high school in\n1922\nand in\n1923\nhe entered the Faculty of Mathematics University of Bucharest. His parents, however, believed that someone as devoted to mathematics as Grigore was, surely must take up engineering. They pressed him to study that subject at the Polytechnic University and so in\n1924\nhe enrolled as a student. Although he progressed well in the engineering courses, this was not a topic which he enjoyed. Mathematics, on the other hand, gave him nothing but the greatest of joy. He was greatly influenced by his lecturers at the University of Bucharest, particularly\nGheorghe ÈiÈeica\nand\nDimitrie Pompeiu\n. Moisil submitted his doctoral thesis\nAnalytical Mechanics of Continuous Systems\nin\n1929\nand the examining committee was lead by\nÈiÈeica\n, with\nPompeiu\nand other mathematicians also on the committee. He never completed his engineering degree at the Polytechnic University, however, and he dropped out in\n1929\n.\nMoisil then went to Paris to study for the year\n1930\n-\n31\nwhere he worked with a number of mathematicians including\nÃlie Cartan\nand\nJacques Hadamard\n. While working there he wrote the paper\nOn a class of systems of equations with partial derivatives from mathematical physics\n. He returned to Romania at the end of his studies in France and was appointed to the Mathematics Department of the University of Iasi in\n1931\n. He left shortly after being appointed to spent another year abroad, this time in Rome, supported by a Rockefeller scholarship, where he spent\n1931\n-\n32\nworking with Vito Volterra. After Rome he spent a short while back in Paris before returning to Iasi where he was appointed provisional associate professor on\n1\nNovember\n1932\n.\nAn important event in Moisil's mathematical life was when he read\nVan der Waerden\n's famous work\nModerne Algebra\nwhich had been published in\n1930\n. Before reading this work Moisil had worked on differential equations, the theory of functions and mechanics.\nVan der Waerden\n's treatise fascinated him, however, and he published his first paper on algebra in\n1934\n. In fact on\n1\nJanuary\n1935\nhe was appointed as Associate Professor of Algebra at the University of Iasi. His interest in algebra certainly did not mean that he stopped working on the other areas that interested him, he just simply added another to the list of topics on which he was undertaking research. He was appointed as Professor of Differential and Integral Calculus on\n1\nNovember\n1936\nat Iasi, then as Professor of Calculus in\n1939\n. Algebra was not the only new research topic for Moisil during these years, for he became interested in logic after reading a paper by\nJan Åukasiewicz\n. Marcus writes in\n[\n14\n]\n:-\nMoisil spent ten years at Iasi University\n(1931\n-\n1941)\n. It was a period in which he alternated his old interests in continuous mathematics with applications to mechanics and physics with his new interests in discrete mathematics, mainly in algebra and logic.\nHis first paper on algebra and logic was\nRecherches sur l'algÃ¨bra de la logique\nâ\n(\nResearch on the algebra of logic\n)\n(1935)\n. However, it was in the paper\nRecherches sur les logiques non-chrysippiennes\nâ\n(\nResearch on non-chrysippian logic\n)\n(1940)\nthat Moisil first defined\n3\n-valued and\n4\n-valued\nÅukasiewicz\nalgebras. These algebras are now called\nÅukasiewicz\n-Moisil algebras or L-M algebras. First we must comment on the title of this paper, in particular the term non-chrysippiennes used by Moisil in the title. By non-chrysippian logic he means multivalued logic\n(\nnon-aristotelian\n)\n. Moisil feels that the strictest standpoint in classical\n(\nformal\n)\nlogic is represented by\nChrysippus\nrather than\nAristotle\n. Hence \"non-chrysippian\" should be more accurate than \"non-aristotelian\". The authors of\n[\n10\n]\nexplain that, in introducing these algebras, Moisil's:-\n... goal was to algebrize\nÅukasiewicz\n's logic. Boolean algebras, algebraic models of classical logic, are particular cases of the new structures.\nTo show the breadth of Moisil's research, let us note that in\n1940\nhe also published\nSur les petits mouvements des corps Ã©lastiques\nâ\n(\nOn the small movements of elastic bodies\n)\nand\nSur les gÃ©odÃ©siques des espaces de Riemann singuliers\nâ\n(\nOn the surveying of singular Riemann spaces\n)\n. In the second of these papers he investigates the properties of singular\nRiemann\nspaces.\nA position of professor at Bucharest University became available in\n1941\nand Moisil put himself forward for the position. However,\nVrÄnceanu\n, Barbilian and Miron Nicolescu also applied for the post and Moisil was the youngest of these four, very well qualified, applicants. Not surprisingly\nVrÄnceanu\nwas appointed but then came a quite twist. Moisil approached the ministry of education explaining what a great opportunity it would be for mathematics in Romania if all of them were to be appointed as professors in Bucharest. It looks like a long shot, but Moisil must have known what he was doing for indeed the ministry of education appointed them all to chairs. Moisil took up his new professorship at Bucharest University at the start of the\n1941\n-\n42\nacademic year.\nIn\n1942\nhe introduced\nn\nn\nn\n-valued L-M algebras generalising the\n3\n-valued and\n4\n-valued ones he had introduced two years earlier\n[\n10\n]\n:-\nMoisil invented L-M algebras in order to create an algebraic structure playing the same role with respect to multiple-valued logic as Boolean algebras play with respect to classical, bivalent logic. However, as shown by the example of A Rose\n[1956]\n, this only happens for the cases\nn\n=\n3\nn = 3\nn\n=\n3\nand\nn\n=\n4\nn  = 4\nn\n=\n4\n.\nThrough the\n1950\nMoisil applied his ideas to the theory of switching circuits. In\n1959\nhe published the book\nThe algebraic theory of switching circuits\n(\nRomanian\n)\nwhich and an excellent summary is given by E F Moore in a review. We quote a part of that review:-\nMore than fifty papers by Moisil, and many additional papers by Ioanin, Nedelcu, Mariana, and others, have developed a distinctive Rumanian approach to switching circuit theory, which remains little known and rarely referred to outside of Romania, despite the fact that most of these papers have been reviewed in Mathematical Reviews. This book gives a very detailed coverage of this approach, starting on a very elementary level, not even presupposing familiarity with the integers modulo n. ...\nThe most distinctive characteristic of this approach is the very strong use that is made of Galois fields. Tables for multiplication, addition, and exponentiation, for\nG\nF\n(\n3\n3\n)\nGF(3^{3})\nG\nF\n(\n3\n3\n)\nand\nG\nF\n(\n5\n2\n)\nGF(5^{2})\nG\nF\n(\n5\n2\n)\nare inserts which fold out from the book, and similar tables for\nG\nF\n(\np\nn\n)\nGF(p^{n})\nG\nF\n(\np\nn\n)\nwhenever\np\nn\n<\n25\np^{n} < 25\np\nn\n<\n2\n5\n, are printed in the text of the book. The\np\nn\np^{n}\np\nn\nstates of a circuit having\nn\nn\nn\nrelays, each of which has p positions, are represented by the elements of\nG\nF\n(\np\nn\n)\nGF(p^{n})\nG\nF\n(\np\nn\n)\n. Lagrangian interpolation polynomials are used in these finite fields, to permit finding algebraic formulas for functions which take on arbitrary values at each state of the circuit. Time is usually assumed to take on only discrete values. Extensive use is also made of\nn\nn\nn\n-valued logic.\nAmong Moisil's other books we mention:\nAssociated matrices of systems of partial differential equations. Introduction to the study of the investigations of I N Lopatinskii\n(\nRomanian\n)\n(1950)\n;\nIntroduction to algebra. I. Rings and ideals\n(\nRomanian\n)\n(1954)\n;\nTime sequential operation of circuits with ideal relays\n(\nRomanian\n)\n(1960)\n;\nEssays old and new on non-classical logic\n(\nRomanian\n)\n(1965)\n;\nAlgebraic theory of schemes with contacts and relays\n(\nRomanian\n)\n(1965)\n; and\nActual functioning of relay switching circuits. I\n(\nRomanian\n)\n(1965)\n.\nMoisil was also involved in the introduction of computers into Romania. In\n1957\nhe assisted in setting up the first Romanian computer in the Institute of Atomic Physics and he encouraged mathematics students to learn computer programming, essentially setting up the first Romanian computer science course.\nEight years after his death, the Faculty of Mathematics of Bucharest University organised a conference on\n10\nJanuary\n1981\non the occasion of Moisil's\n75\nth\nbirthday. The conference was dedicated to his life and work and many spoke of their appreciation for his outstanding contributions. C Andreian Cazacu delivered the opening address in which he said:-\nProf Gr C Moisil has fought with all his energy and perseverance in order to open the way to the understanding of mathematics in our country now and in the future. He has been aware of the importance of informatics, cybernetics and automata theory. He has created centres of computation.\nOther speakers included P P Teodorescu who said::-\nProfessor Moisil has cultivated with great pleasure and passion the boundary sciences and has created various schools - mechanics, automata theory, etc. He has contributed to different literary journals. He has had his column 'Science and Humanism' at the 'Contemporanul'.\nMoisil was elected to the\nRomanian Academy of Sciences\nin\n1948\n, the Academy of Sciences in Bologna and to the International Institute of Philosophy. He was honoured posthumously for his contributions to computing when the IEEE Computer Society awarded him their \"Computer Pioneer\" prize in\n1996\n, twenty-three years after his death. In\n2002\nViorica Moisil, Grigore Moisil's widow, published her husband's diary so giving the world a deeper look into the character of this outstanding mathematician.",
