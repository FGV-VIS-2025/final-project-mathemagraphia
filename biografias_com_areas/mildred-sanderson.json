  "biografia": "Mildred Sanderson\nwas the daughter of Horace M Sanderson\n(1856\n-\n1937)\nand Edna E Pratt\n(1862\n-\n1933))\n. Horace Sanderson, the son of the farmer Nathan Sanderson and his wife Adeline Wellington, was born in Waltham, Middlesex, Massachusetts. Many generations of the Sanderson family had lived and farmed in Waltham for over\n200\nyears. Horace followed the tradition and became a farmer. He married Edna Pratt on\n16\nMay\n1883\nin Waltham. Edna Pratt had been born in Hadley, Hampshire, Massachusetts to the farmer Edwin E Pratt and his wife Harriet Augusta Hemenway. Horace and Edna Sanderson had five children: May Evelyn Sanderson\n(1884\n-\n1941)\n; Alice Gertrude Sanderson\n(1886\n-\n1956)\n, known as Gertrude; Mildred Leonora Sanderson\n(1889\n-\n1914)\n, the subject of this biography; Amelia Hemenway Sanderson\n(1894\n-\n1897)\n; and Ralph Hemenway Sanderson\n(1898\n-\n1979)\n.\nAt the time of the\n1900\nUS census, Horace Sanderson's occupation is given as florist and market gardener, the three oldest children are at school, while the youngest Ralph is only one year old. There are only four children since Amelia died in\n1897\naged two. Living with them are two servants, Thomas Garrity, a farm labourer who emigrated from Ireland to the USA, and Celia Daly, employed by the family to do general housework, who also emigrated from Ireland to the USA. At the time of the\n1910\nUS census, Horace Sanderson's occupation is given as market gardener and florist. All four children are still living at home, May and Gertrude are both teachers in a public school while Mildred's occupation is recorded as 'none'. Also living with them is Horace's brother Edmund L Sanderson, a proprietor and Waltham machine worker, and Horace's sister Ella O Sanderson. In the same house are two hired farm hands, both of whom had emigrated from Italy to the USA.\nMildred Sanderson attended the North Grammar School and Waltham High School, two public schools in Waltham which were closely linked. Waltham High School had been founded in\n1832\nwith the construction of a building on the corner of Lexington Street and School Street. Until\n1849\n, when the town administrative officials moved from this building to the City Hall, this building was shared by the administrators, the Grammar School, and the High School. Waltham High School became a separate school in\n1869\nwith the joint construction of North Grammar School and a new High School building at the corner of Church Street and School Street. Sanderson graduated from the North Grammar School in\n1902\nbefore being a highly successful pupil at Waltham High School from which she graduated in\n1906\nas valedictorian. One of her teachers at Waltham High School wrote\n(\nsee\n[\n7\n]\n)\n:-\nMiss Sanderson was gentle-mannered, of brilliant intellect, an exact student, broad-minded, self-reliant, and courageous.\nEntering Mount Holyoke College in\n1906\n, she received \"Sophomore Honors\" in June\n1908\n, for general scholarship, and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree with \"Senior Honors\" in mathematics in\n1910\n. Let us say a little about this famous College. Founded in\n1837\nin South Hadley, Massachusetts, as Mount Holyoke Female Seminary by the chemist Mary Lyon, it was the first of the Seven Sisters women's colleges. Originally having a three year course, this was extended to four years in\n1861\n. Its seminary curriculum was phased out in\n1893\nand it changed its name to Mount Holyoke College at this time. It had an excellent reputation for teaching academic subjects and provided Sanderson with a high quality education.\nSanderson was awarded a Bardwell Memorial Fellowship for\n1910\nand\n1911\n. This Fellowship was awarded by the Alumnae Association of Mount Holyoke College to outstanding students. The recipient was not restricted in the subject of study, nor in the place of study, and Sanderson chose to take graduate studies in mathematics at the University of Chicago. The University had an outstanding collection of professors of mathematics at this time including\nEliakim Hastings Moore\n,\nLeonard Eugene Dickson\n,\nHerbert Ellsworth Slaught\nand\nGilbert Ames Bliss\n.\nAt the University of Chicago, Sanderson was advised by\nL E Dickson\nand began studying for her Master's Degree. She was awarded the A.M. degree in\n1911\nhaving written the dissertation\nGeneralizations in the Theory of Numbers and Theory of Linear Groups\n. Not many people have written a Master's dissertation in one year which is of such a standard that it leads to a publication in the\nAnnals of Mathematics\n, but this is exactly what Sanderson achieved.\nL E Dickson\nwrites\n[\n7\n]\n:-\nOf this original and valuable thesis a very brief extract was printed in the 'Annals of Mathematics', Series\n2\n, Volume\n13\n,\n1911\n, pages\n36\n-\n39\n. This work might well have served for her doctor's thesis; but she was quite willing to undertake a new investigation in a wholly different field.\nThe four page paper has the following Introduction:-\nThe term function is here used to denote a rational integral function of y with integral coefficients. Employing a fixed integer m and a fixed function P\n(\ny\n)\n, we shall say that two functions are congruent modulis m and P\n(\ny\n)\nif their difference can be given the form mq\n(\ny\n)\n+ P\n(\ny\n)\nQ\n(\ny\n)\n; also that f\n(\ny\n)\nhas an inverse\nf\n1\n(\ny\n)\nf_{1}(y)\nf\n1\nâ\n(\ny\n)\nif\nf\n(\ny\n)\n.\nf\n1\n(\ny\n)\nf(y).f_{1}(y)\nf\n(\ny\n)\n.\nf\n1\nâ\n(\ny\n)\nis congruent to unity modulo m, P\n(\ny\n)\n. Then f\n(\ny\n)\nand f\n(\ny\n)\n+ k\n(\ny\n)\nP\n(\ny\n)\nhave the same inverse, so that we may restrict attention to functions of degree less than the degree r of P\n(\ny\n)\n. We proceed to prove the\nTheorem\n.\nIf P\n(\ny\n)\nis of degree r and is irreducible with respect to each prime factor of m, a function R\n(\ny\n)\nof degree < r has an inverse modulis m and P\n(\ny\n)\nif and only if the greatest common divisor d of the coefficients of R\n(\ny\n)\nis prime to m.\nIn\n1913\nshe was awarded a Ph.D. having submitted the thesis\nFormal Modular Invariants with Applications to Binary Modular Covariants\n. The main results of the thesis were published in the paper\n[\n10\n]\npublished in the\nTransactions\nof the\nAmerican Mathematical Society\n.\nL E Dickson\nwrites that her thesis\n[\n7\n]\n:-\n... was entitled \"Formal Modular Invariants with Applications to Binary Modular Covariants,\" and appeared in the 'Transactions' of the\nAmerican Mathematical Society\n, Volume\n14\n,\n1913\n, pages\n489\n-\n500\n. This paper is a highly important contribution to this new field of work; its importance lies partly in the fact that it establishes a correspondence between modular and formal invariants. Her main theorem has already been frequently quoted on account of its fundamental character. Her proof is a remarkable piece of mathematics.\nE T Bell\nwrote in\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nMiss Sanderson's single contribution\n(1913)\nto modular invariants has been rated by competent judges as one of the classics of the subject.\nSanderson writes in the paper:-\nWe see clearly just how the difference in the definitions of formal and modular invariants affects the actual computations.\nDickson\nhas given a very simple and elegant theory of modular invariants. No theory has been developed for formal invariants. However, there exists between the two subjects an interesting and important relation, which I shall develop in what follows. I take this opportunity to express my gratitude to Professor\nDickson\nfor his interest and many helpful suggestions, in particular for the present formulation of this introductory section.\nIn the\n30\npage thesis there is the following Vita:-\nMILDRED SANDERSONÂ was born in\n1889\nin Waltham, Massachusetts, where she received her secondary school education. She took the degree of Bachelor of Arts at Mount Holyoke College in\n1910\n, the degrees of Master of Science\n(1911)\nand Doctor of Philosophy\n(1913)\nat the University of Chicago, doing her major work in mathematics, and her minorÂ work in astronomy.\nWe note that\nForest Ray Moulton\nand\nErnest Julius Wilczynski\nhad taught astronomy courses which Sanderson had studied as part of her minor subject.\nAfter the award of her doctorate, Sanderson was appointed as an Instructor in Mathematics at the University of Wisconsin. The authors of\n[\n4\n]\nwrite:-\nSanderson was an instructor at the University of Wisconsin during the first semester\n1913\n-\n14\nbut left in February\n1914\nwhen she became ill with pulmonary tuberculosis. She died at age twenty-five in a hospital in East Bridgewater, Massachusetts, the following October. Services were conducted in her family's home in Waltham by a pastor of the First Baptist Church, and she was buried in Mt Feake cemetery in Waltham.\nL E Dickson\nwrites\n[\n7\n]\n:-\nThe remarkable mathematical ability and originality shown by Miss Sanderson in her master's and doctor's theses and the very unusual ease with which she assimilated ideas in all branches of pure and applied mathematics, combined with her enthusiasm for that science, gave full promise of a highly successful career for her in research.  Her death on October\n15\n,\n1914\n, only a year after completing her graduate studies, was not only a distinct loss to progress in mathematical research in America, but was a very keen blow to her fellow  students, to all of whom she had endeared herself by her most lovable personality. ... If I may be permitted to add my personal tribute to the universally expressed tribute to her remarkable ability, it would be to say that she was my most gifted pupil.\nWe note that Mount Holyoke College established the Mildred L Sanderson Prize for Mathematics in\n1939\n.",
