  "biografia": "Wolfgang Haack\nwas born in Gotha, a town in central Germany, the son of Hermann Haack\n(1872\n-\n1966)\nand his wife Johanna KÃ¶nig. Hermann Haack had studied cartography and geography at the University of GÃ¶ttingen and, after completing his thesis, had begun work at the 'Geographical-Cartographical Institute' in Gotha in\n1897\n. Wolfgang attended the\ngymnasium\nin Gotha and then went to the Technische Hochschule in Hanover in\n1921\n. After a year as a student studying mechanical engineering, Haack moved to the Friedrich-Schiller University of Jena where he studied mathematics. He was awarded his doctorate in\n1926\nafter submitting his dissertation\nDie Bestimmung von FlÃ¤chen, deren geodÃ¤tische Linien durch die Abbildung in die Ebene in Kegelschnitte Ã¼bergehen\nâ\n(\nThe determination of surfaces whose geodesic lines merge into plane conics\n)\n. His thesis advisor had been Robert Haussner.\nHaack  spent the next two years at Hamburg University with\nWilhelm Blaschke\n. While he was there he passed the state examination to become a qualified gymnasium teacher of mathematics. In the following year he worked in Stuttgart as an assistant to\nWilhelm Kutta\nand Friedrich Georg Pfeiffer, then in the autumn of\n1928\nhe went to the Technische Hochschule in Danzig as assistant to Julius Sommer. While in Danzig he submitted his\nhabilitation\nthesis\nAffine Differentialgeometrie der Strahlensysteme\nâ\n(\nAffine differential geometry of beam systems\n)\nin\n1929\nand, following this, he became a\nprivatdozent\nin Danzig. He applied for a position as an assistant to Rudolf Rothe at the Technische Hochschule Berlin-Charlottenburg and on\n31\nMay\n1934\nErnst Pohlhausen, who was a former rector of the Technische Hochschule in Danzig, wrote a letter of recommendation\n[\n1\n]\n:-\n... mentioning Haack's many excellences as a teacher and reputed fine scholarship.\nNow, of course, by this time the Nazis had come to power and any appointments had to be approved politically. The political report discussed Haack's character saying that\n[\n1\n]\n:-\n... in straitened economic circumstances for three years, Haack has nevertheless been a successful teacher and productive scholar. ... Haack has a clear-thinking critical mind, whose very frank judgment and unconditional maintenance of what he has once recognized as correct have caused him multiple difficulties. On the other hand, exactly these qualities, together with his amiable nature, have won him attention among his colleagues.\nIt also appended a report on his political views which must have made him only marginally acceptable to the Nazis\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nAlthough during the time of struggle of the National Socialist movement, Herr Haack had been uncomprehendingly opposed to it, it is to be assumed that his entering the motorized SA, to which he has belonged for a long time, accompanies an inner conversion.\nHaving been approved, in\n1935\nHaack took up his new post in Berlin. He married the physicist Marianne Blumentritt, a student of Friedrich Hund, Georg Joos and Peter Debye, in\n1936\n. Her doctoral thesis had been presented to Jena University and published in\nAnnalen der Physik\nin\n1928\n. Haack did not spend long in Berlin for in\n1937\nhe was appointed to a lectureship in Mathematics and Geometry at the Technische Hochschule of Karlsruhe. He was promoted to an extraordinary professor in\n1938\nand, two years later, to full professor.\nUp to this time Haack had produced many excellent papers on geometry, in particular on\ndifferential geometry\n. For example his papers included\nAffine Differentialgeometrie der Strahlensysteme\nâ\n(\nAffine differential geometry of beam systems\n)\n(1929)\n,\nAffine Differentialgeometrie der parabolischen Strahlensysteme\nâ\n(\nAffine differential geometry of parabolic beam systems\n)\n(1931)\nand\nEine geometrische Deutung der Affin-Invarianten einer Raumkurve\nâ\n(\nA geometric interpretation of affine invariants of a space curve\n)\n(1934)\n. However, around\n1936\n, he began to work on problems in gas dynamics and differential equations, collaborating with his wife on these topics. He explained in later writings and interviews that, seeing the approaching war and realising that differential geometry was \"not very much tuned to war purposes\", he changed areas. In a\n1991\ninterview he explained that he was\n[\n7\n]\n:-\n... afraid to be called to the army as an ordinary soldier, because he had been classified as a 'driver only' in examination.\nThe \"Aeronautical Proving Ground Hermann GÃ¶ring\" in Braunschweig put forward a project to determine the optimum shape of missiles which was a problem involving ballistics and fluid dynamics. As soon as war had broken out Haack phoned the head of research at GÃ¶ring's aviation ministry offering his services. The work, which he carried out in collaboration with his wife, led to a paper he presented in\n1941\n. Hoyrup writes\n[\n7\n]\n:-\nParticular mathematical activities of very different kinds and theoretical levels\n(\npure analysis, numerical algorithms, graphical methods\n)\nwere involved. There was a gradual approach of two different engineering disciplines, ballistics and aerodynamics, that were about to recognise what they had in common mathematically. There was a pure mathematician\n(\nHaack\n)\nwho made use of his special expertise\n(\ndifferential geometry\n)\n...\nAlthough his report was top secret in\n1941\n, it was translated into English and published in\n1948\nunder the title\nProjectile shapes for smallest wave drag\n. W R Sears writes in a review:-\nUsing\nvon KÃ¡rmÃ¡n\n's approximate theory of slender bodies in supersonic flow, the author determines the optimum shapes of projectiles for prescribed\n(\ni\n)\ncalibre and length,\n(\nii\n)\nvolume and length,\n(\niii\n)\nvolume and calibre. Only wave drag is considered. The method of calculation is first to attack the single variational problem of minimum drag for given calibre, length and volume, by standard methods.\nHaack's work was effective for the war effort\n[\n7\n]\n:-\n... there is no doubt that the job\n[\nHaack\n]\ndid was urgent and his results were really used to produce anti-aircraft projectiles. With undisguised pride Haack reported on the \"success\" of his theory of projectiles which allowed for a considerable extension of reach of German anti-aircraft artillery.\nHoyrup makes a point about Haack's mathematics being put to a deadly use\n[\n7\n]\n:-\nNot just in the background of this story but rather dominant is, of course, the peculiar political situation of the war. One sees the indifference of an allegedly apolitical mathematician to the destructive and deadly aspect of the military use of his science.\nReader must think about this point, and form their own opinion, not just as it relates to Haack, but also to hundreds of mathematicians whose advances have been used for destructive purposes.\nReturning to Haack's career, we note that in\n1944\n, the Technische Hochschule of Berlin tried to persuade him to accept a chair but his war work prevented a move at this time. After the war ended,\nGeorg Hamel\nwas appointed to a chair of Mathematics and Mechanics at the Technische Hochschule of Berlin but, in\n1949\n, Haack succeeded to\nHamel\n's chair. From\n1945\nto\n1949\nhe had been working as an advisor to the \"British Research Branch\" in Bad Gandersheim. He had also had roles as a visiting professor at ETH ZÃ¼rich and at the University of GÃ¶ttingen. As well as his chair at the Technische Hochschule of Berlin, from\n1950\nHaack had an honorary position at the Free University of Berlin. In\n1964\nHaack was named professor of numerical mathematics in a new Department of Computational Mathematics which had been founded thanks largely to his efforts. He held this position for four years until he retired and was made professor emeritus. In fact perhaps Haack's most important contribution at the Technische Hochschule of Berlin was his successful effort to introduce electronic computers\n[\n5\n]\n:-\nWhen, after the war, he found out more about electronic computers, he was seized by their future importance for science, and he founded a working group for electronic computing devices in\n1950\n. During the years to come, Haack tried to have a computer installed at the TU Berlin and to this end contacted\nKonrad Zuse\n. The biggest handicap was finance, and Haack was turned down by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft\n(\nGerman Research Council\n)\nas this body considered it perfectly satisfactory for Germany's Universities that GÃ¶ttingen, Darmstadt and Munich were actively working in the area of electronic computers. In response he managed to obtain donations from a number of companies, finally acquiring the funds needed so that the TU Berlin's first computer could begin work in\n1958\n, thanks above all to his work.\nLet us now look briefly at some of Haack's publications. In\n1948\nhe published the two volume work\nDifferential-Geometrie\n. A Schwartz writes in a review:-\nThe style is concise and clear, and the explanations and derivations are almost always motivated by intuitive geometric considerations.\nIn\n1955\nhe published\nElementare Differentialgeometrie\nâ\n(\nElementary differential geometry\n)\nwhich used some of the same chapters as his\n1948\nbook but contains three new chapters. One year earlier, he had published\nDarstellende Geometrie. I. Die wichtigsten Darstellungsmethoden. Grund- und Aufriss ebenflÃ¤chiger KÃ¶rper\nâ\n(\nDescriptive geometry. I. The most important methods of presentation. Ground plan and elevation of planar body\n)\nand, in the same year of\n1954\n, the second volume\nDarstellende Geometrie. II. KÃ¶rper mit krummen BegrenzungsflÃ¤chen. Kotierte Projektionen\nâ\n(\nDescriptive geometry. II. Body with crooked boundary surfaces. listed projections\n)\n. The third, and final, volume\nDarstellende Geometrie. III. Axonometrie und Perspektive\nâ\n(\nDescriptive geometry. III. Axonometry and perspective\n)\nwas published in\n1957\n. As well as these books on geometry, he also continued his work on gas dynamics; for example in\n1958\nhe published the paper\n(\npublished jointly with his doctoral student Gerhard Bruhn\n)\nEin Charakteristikenverfahren fÃ¼r dreidimensionale instationÃ¤re GasstrÃ¶mungen\nâ\n(\nA characteristic method for three-dimensional unsteady gas flows\n)\nin which he derived the characteristic equations for the unsteady three-dimensional motion of inviscid perfect gas.\nAt the Technische Hochschule of Berlin, Haach lectured on systems of two linear partial differential equations of first order in two independent variables, in particular, elliptic systems. His course was written up in collaboration with Wolfgang Wendland\n(\none of Haack's doctoral students\n)\nin\n1966\nas\nSysteme linearer partieller Differentialgleichungen\nâ\n(\nSystems of linear partial differential equations\n)\n. Three years later the same two authors published the\n550\n-page book\nVorlesungen Ã¼ber Partielle und Pfaffsche Differentialgleichungen\nâ\n(\nLectures on partial and Pfaffian differential equations\n)\n. Schechter writes in the review\n[\n8\n]\n:-\nThis book combines the study of partial and\nPfaff\ndifferential equations. The point of view is to consider partial differential equations in the framework of\nPfaff\nequations. ... The presentation is clear and detailed. Various examples help to motivate the material. ... The reader interested in this subject will benefit much from the book.\nFinally, we note that Haack was honoured by being elected president of the\nGerman Mathematical Society\n(\nDeutsche Mathematiker-Vereinigung\n)\nin\n1961\n-\n62\n.",
