  "biografia": "Fritz Zwicky\nwas the son of Fridolin Zwicky\n(1868\n-\n1944)\n, a prominent industrialist in Varna who was born in Switzerland, and Franziska VrÄek\n(1871\n-\n1927)\nwho was a Czech born in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Fritz was the eldest of his parents' three children, having a younger brother Rudolf Zwicky\n(1900\n-\n1952)\nand sister Leonie\n(1905\n-\n1980)\n. Fritz only spent the first six years of his life in Varna for, in\n1904\n, he was sent to Mollis, Glarus canton, Switzerland, the home of his paternal grandparents, to be educated. Fritz's mother Franziska remained in Varna for the rest of her life. Fritz's father served as Norwegian Consul in Varna from\n1906\nto\n1933\nand remained in Varna until\n1944\nwhen he returned to Switzerland, the country of his birth, and died soon after. Fritz's sister Leonie married a Bulgarian from Varna and remained in that city for the rest of her life. Rudolf became Norwegian Consul in Varna after his father left the post in\n1933\nand held this position until\n1940\n. By\n1946\nhe was living in Switzerland.\nZwicky's father wanted his son to follow an education which would lead to a career in commerce but Zwicky found mathematics and science so fascinating that he persuaded his father to let him study engineering at university. Zwicky attended primary school in Mollis and from there went to the HÃ¶here Stadtschule in Glarus. In\n1914\nhe went to ZÃ¼rich where he completed his school education at the Industry School\n(\ntoday the Mathematisch-Naturwissenschatliches Gymnasium\n)\n.\nAfter graduating from the Industry School in ZÃ¼rich in\n1916\n, Zwicky entered the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology\n(\nthe EidgenÃ¶ssische Technische Hochschule or simply ETH\n)\nwhere he switched from engineering to study mathematics and physics. He obtained his first degree in\n1920\nhaving specialised in mathematics with\nHermann Weyl\nas the supervisor of his dissertation. He then continued to study at ETH for his doctorate advised by Peter Debye\n(1884\n-\n1966)\nwho, after being Professor of Theoretical Physics at Zurich University\n(1911\n-\n12)\n, then Utrecht University\n(1912\n-\n14)\n, followed by the University of GÃ¶ttingen\n(1914\n-\n20)\n, had been appointed Professor of Physics and Principal of the EidgenÃ¶ssische Technische Hochschule in\n1920\n. Zwicky was also advised by Paul Scherrer\n(1890\n-\n1969)\n, a student of Debye at GÃ¶ttingen, who had been appointed Professor of Experimental Physics at ETH in\n1920\n. Zwicky studied the applications of quantum mechanics to crystals for his Ph.D., a topic involving both physics and chemistry. During his study for his Ph.D. he met several leading scientists such as\nAlbert Einstein\nand\nWolfgang Pauli\n. After being awarded his Ph.D. in\n1922\nfor his thesis\nOn the theory of ionic crystals\n, Zwicky worked at ETH as a scientific assistant from\n1922\nto\n1925\n.\nZwicky is known today for his remarkable contributions to theoretical astronomy but there is no evidence of him being involved in any work related to astronomy during his studies in Switzerland. It was, surprisingly, the Swiss mountains that influenced his move to astronomy in an unexpected way. The Rockefeller Foundation realised the importance of quantum mechanics and decided to put up fellowships to enable experts in that subject to come to the United States. In\n1925\nZwicky was offered such a fellowship and, since he was an avid skier and mountaineer, he asked to be posted to a position in the United States where there are mountains. The Rockefeller Foundation sent him to the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, California. Leaving Cherbourg, France, on the S S Lapland on\n18\nSeptember\n1925\n, Zwicky arrived in New York on\n26\nSeptember en route to Pasadena. Once he had arrived he found that there are certainly mountains nearby, with the San Rafael Hills and the San Gabriel Mountains, but he was unimpressed with them saying that Pasadena only had \"foothills.\" The San Gabriel Mountains, however, was the location of the Mount Wilson Observatory where\nEdwin Hubble\nwas working and Zwicky began to become interested in astronomy.\nArriving with a Rockefeller fellowship from the International Education Board to support\n2\nyears' work at the California Institute of Technology, Zwicky was supposed to work under Robert Millikan on quantum mechanics of atoms and metals\n[\n9\n]\n:-\nMillikan had expected Zwicky to work on quantum theory of solids and liquids, and he indeed published in these areas, but his primary interests gradually turned to astrophysics, beginning with cosmic rays and ideas for how they might arise.\nWhen his fellowship ended in\n1929\n, the California Institute of Technology appointed Zwicky as an associate professor of physics, a post he was to hold until\n1942\n. On\n25\nMarch\n1932\nhe married Dorothy Vernon Gates\n(1904\n-\n1991)\n, the daughter of the California state senator Egbert James Gates and his wife Emma Vernon. They had no children and were divorced in\n1941\n. He was appointed professor of astrophysics at the California Institute of Technology in\n1942\n, the first person to hold this chair, and he continued in this position until he retired at the age of seventy in\n1968\n. He had married Anna Margarita ZÃ¼rcher on\n15\nOctober\n1947\n. Anna was the daughter of an hotel owner in Bern, Switzerland, who was working as a cashier when they met. Fritz and Anna Zwicky had three daughters, Margarit\n(\nborn\n1948)\n,  Franziska\n(\nborn\n1950)\n, and Barbarina\n(\nborn\n1952)\n.\nLet us look now at some of Zwicky's outstanding contributions. In\n1931\nhe began a collaboration with Walter Baade who had noticed that novae, stars which suddenly increase dramatically in brightness and are relatively close to the solar system, also were sometimes observed in galaxies which had been shown to be at vast distances from the Milky Way. Although mechanisms for relatively nearby novae were at least comprehensible, the immense energy need to power these distant objects was beyond understanding. Baade and Zwicky also noticed that cosmic rays appeared to be associated with these objects which they called supernovae. Zwicky tried to explain how cosmic rays could be produced by these supernovae but failed to find anything to satisfy himself. The other major problem which they tried to explain was how a star could produce such incredible amounts of energy. In\n1932\nJames Chadwick had discovered the neutron and soon Zwicky and Baade saw how this could solve the problem. They wrote in March\n1934\n:-\n... we advance the view that a supernova represents the transition of an ordinary star into a neutron star, consisting mainly of neutrons. Such a star may possess a very small radius and an extremely high density. As neutrons can be packed much more closely than ordinary nuclei and electrons, the 'gravitational packing' energy in a cold neutron star may become very large, and, under certain circumstances, may far exceed the ordinary nuclear packing fractions. A neutron star would therefore represent the most stable configuration of matter as such.\nAlthough this first prediction of a neutron star has proved correct, it was ignored at the time and even when it was independently put forward later, no mention was made of their\n1934\nprediction.\nZwicky, realising that supernovae occurred very infrequently, proposed building a telescope which could photograph large numbers of galaxies in a wide-angled photograph. He persuaded the California Institute of Technology to build an\n18\ninch Schmidt camera which was completed in\n1936\nand used by him for many years. Koenig writes\n[\n10\n]\n:-\nIn\n1935\nZwicky traveled to Hamburg to visit Schmidt. Upon his return to Pasadena, he and Millikan convinced Hale to allocate $\n25\n,\n000\nof the Rockefeller grant for an\n18\n-inch Schmidt, \"on the pretext to the Rockefeller Foundation that it was needed as a scout instrument for the\n200\n-inch telescope\". It was constructed under the direction of John A Anderson and put in operation in September\n1936\n. Baade stated that this was \"sooner than expected!\" Perhaps this was a result of Zwicky's immediate visit to Hamburg and solicitation for funding.\nIt was Zwicky's father-in-law, the wealthy Egbert James Gates, who gave a considerable amount towards the\n18\n-inch Schmidt telescope. Using this instrument, throughout his career Zwicky discovered\n129\nsupernovae in distant galaxies. His belief that supernovae could be used to map out the universe was correct but again it took many years before astronomers used this technique.\nAnother remarkable prediction was made by Zwicky in\n1933\nafter studying the COMA cluster of galaxies. He was able to estimate the velocities of the galaxies within the cluster and realised that the observed mass of the galaxies was not nearly enough to allow gravity to keep them bound together. He wrote in an article in\nHelvetica Physica Acta\n:-\nIn order to receive an average Doppler effect of\n1000\nkm/s or more, which is what we have observed, the average density in the COMA system would have to be at least\n400\ntimes greater than that of visible matter. If this can be shown to be the case, then it would have the surprising result that dark matter is present in the Universe in far greater density than visible matter.\nAlthough much of the data that Zwicky was using, such as the best estimate for the\nHubble\nconstant, was later modified considerably, nevertheless his prediction based on relatively limited statistics is now universally accepted. With this work he has earned himself the title of \"Father of dark matter.\"\nAnother of Zwicky's brilliant ideas was that galaxies could be used as gravitational lenses.\nEinstein\nhad mentioned the fact that stars could act as gravitational lenses but noted that \"there is no great chance of observing this phenomenon.\" In\n1937\nZwicky published two letters in\nThe Physical Review\n. In the first,\nNebulae as gravitational lenses\n, he wrote:-\n... I made some calculations which show that extragalactic nebulae offer a much better chance than stars for the observation of gravitational lens effects.\nIn the second letter of\n1937\nto\nThe Physical review\n,\nOn the probability of detecting nebulae which act as gravitational lenses\n, Zwicky wrote:-\nProvided that our present estimates of the masses of cluster nebulae are correct, the probability that nebulae which act as gravitational lenses will be found becomes practically a certainty. ...\n[\nFor\n]\naround one in about one hundred nebulae the ring-like image of a distant nebula should be expected, provided that the chosen nebula has an apparent angular radius smaller than the angles through which light is deflected on grazing the surface of this nebula.\nHe also wrote that this method of gravitational lensing could be used to investigate dark matter. As with many of Zwicky's ideas, this was not followed up by astronomers for many years. In fact it was not until\n1979\n, over\n40\nyears later, that the first gravitational lens was discovered. This was five years after Zwicky's death.\nOf course anyone who was prepared to put forward ideas as freely as Zwicky will get some wrong and, indeed, this is true of him. Let us give one interesting example. The redshift of the galaxies was taken by most astronomers to be a\nDoppler\nEffect arising from an expanding universe. Zwicky was not satisfied with this explanation and noted, correctly, that there could be other causes such as a gravitational drag, light slowly losing energy over billions of years, or even that the laws of physics could change over time. In\n1939\nhe claimed to have a \"proof\" that the universe was older than the time from the \"big bang\" when the expansion began. His \"proof\" was based on the spherical nature of most clusters of galaxies which, he \"proved\" could only happen over a much longer timescale than that predicted by the expanding universe. There is much evidence today to show that Zwicky was wrong on this topic and the expansion of the universe is real.\nLet us now look at some work that Zwicky undertook on developing rockets.\nTheodore von KÃ¡rmÃ¡n\nset up Aerojet in\n1936\n, becoming its director. He was joined by a number of scientists from the California Institute of Technology including Zwicky. At this stage the basic interest of Aerojet was to produce rockets which could be used for spaceflight which would greatly advance astronomy and, in addition, other sciences. At first no practical work was undertaken and the group met occasionally to discuss their objectives. A first test rocket was launched in August\n1941\nand the United States Air Force became interested. Aerojet Engineering Corporation was formally incorporated in March\n1942\n.\nVon KÃ¡rmÃ¡n\nwrote:-\nThus began ... the world's largest manufacturer of rockets and propellants. In only twenty years it was to grow from six people with a capitalisation of $\n1200\ninto a\n700\n-million-dollar a year business, a staff of nearly\n34\n,\n000\n, and a key role in the modern defence picture of the United States.\nBy\n1943\n, the US Air Corps had ordered\n3000\nrockets from Aerojet for jet-assisted take-off technology for their aircraft. In the same year Zwicky was made head of Aerojet's research department\n[\n11\n]\n:-\nAt War's end, Zwicky toured secret weapons programs in Germany and Japan. Later, he helped Aerojet develop many of the high energy fuels used in today's solid rocket boosters.\nReturning to the United States from Paris in August\n1946\nhe completed an Information Sheet which gives details such as the trip was paid for by the American Air Force and personal details such as: height\n6\nft\n1\n/\n2\ninch, complexion fair, colour of hair grey-brown, colour of eyes hazel.\nFor this contribution to the war effort, Zwicky was awarded the United States Medal of Freedom in\n1949\n. Zwicky, although born in Bulgaria, had Swiss citizenship through his father. He did not become an American citizen so during World War II he had to be given a special clearance by the US government to allow him to undertake war work. This clearance was removed in\n1955\nand he had the option of taking American citizenship or leaving Aerojet. He refused to give up his Swiss citizenship and therefore left Aerojet.\nZwicky believed that equally important to his scientific discoveries was his method of making them which he called morphological outlook and method. He explained:-\nAfter pursuing a dozen or so various activities ranging from mountain climbing and professional shorthand to physics, astronomy, engineering, languages, higher education, national and international politics, and mutual aid with fair success, I still did not feel satisfied. ... It was difficult to account for the lack of satisfaction until it occurred to me ... that no stereotype activity in the books of the past corresponds to my personal genius. Its nature is such that it could become fully alive only through the creation of a new profession - the morphologist.\nIn\n1948\nZwicky delivered the\nHalley\nlecture for\n1948\n,\nMorphological astronomy\n, at the University of Oxford. We give the beginnings of that lecture at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nIn\n1957\nFritz Zwicky published the book\nMorphological astronomy\n. We give a version of the Foreword of this book at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nExtracts from some reviews of two books written by Fritz Zwicky on morphology and one book of which he was both co-editor and a contributor on morphology are given at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nRitchey writes\n[17]\n:-\nZwicky has been described as a notorious maverick in science, both brilliant and insufferable. On the brilliant side, Zwicky was truly a \"high flyer\", an \"outlier\", who went his own way and formulated ideas and hypotheses that were ahead of their time. Some of them were wrong - many right. His triple hypothesis about the nature of supernovae, neutron stars and cosmic rays in the\n1930\n's was scoffed at by many, but turned out to be completely correct - and, under better circumstances, might have earned him a Nobel Prize. He was also a great humanist, engaged in a number of charitable activities, including years of work to help rebuild scientific libraries destroyed during the Second World War and participating in the Pestalozzi Foundation's program to establish war orphan villages. On the other side, the authors do not try to cover up the fact that Zwicky was, all too often, what we today would call a \"difficult person\". There are scores of anecdotes about his deeds and manners, his \"salty\" attitude and abusive statements\n(\nno doubt embellished over time\n)\n. ... His sometimes overbearing and belligerent manner irritated a lot of people, and this may well have contributed to his present day lack of recognition.\nIt must be said that he \"irritated a lot of people\" because he said what he thought of them, criticism that was usually entirely justified. Perhaps the most prestigious scientific award he received was the\nRoyal Astronomical Society\n's Gold Medal in\n1972\n. Today Zwicky has received more recognition as many of his remarkable predictions are verified. Asteroid\n1803\nZwicky is named for him as is lunar crater Zwicky.\nJesse Greenstein writes\n[\n7\n]\n:-\nIt is difficult to write a brief, conventional memoir about so unconventional a man. Fritz classified scientists into two categories, eagles and low-fliers; a low-flier like myself recognised clearly that Fritz was the high-flier. He pursued an extraordinary range of personal interests: international charities, city-planning, mountain climbing, new explosives, exploding stars, crystals and dying stars, and, especially galaxies. He always saw the Universe in his own original way; he loved the extraordinary objects it contained, and he explained them in his own fashion, sometimes wrong but never dull.\nAs a final quote let us record Zwicky's feelings for both his homeland and for the world:-\nWe hope to have served the world and our homeland by simultaneously playing the local patriots and world citizens.",
