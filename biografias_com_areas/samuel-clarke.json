  "biografia": "Samuel Clarke\n's parents were Hannah Parmenter and Edward Clarke. Hannah was the daughter of a Norwich merchant while Edward was a cloth manufacturer. Samuel was educated in Norwich, attending the Norwich Free Grammar School from\n1685\nto\n1690\n, then entering Caius College, Cambridge in\n1691\n. At Cambridge he\n[\n2\n]\n:-\n... was noted for the range of his interests and his attempt to span all fields of knowledge in an age when science, and learning more generally, were increasingly becoming the province of the expert.\nHe studied\nNewton\n's works, going deeply into both the mathematics and physics, but he also studied divinity and classical studies. He graduated in\n1695\noffering parts of\nNewton\n's\nPrincipia\nfor his final examinations. He became a Fellow of Caius College, Cambridge, as a result of his performance in defending a proposition from\nNewton\n's\nPrincipia\nin a disputation. He held this fellowship from\n1696\nto\n1700\n. One of the tasks he undertook at this time was a Latin translation of Rohault's\nTraitÃ© de physique\nâ\n(\nTreatise on physics\n)\nwhich was a physics text based on the physics of\nDescartes\n. Clarke added notes giving a Newtonian perspective to the text which was published in\n1697\n. When he produced further editions in\n1702\nand\n1710\n, Clarke went even further in producing a text based on Newtonian physics.\nA chance meeting with\nWhiston\n, at that time chaplain to the Bishop of Norwich, in a Norwich coffee house led to their discussing\nNewton\n's work.\nWhiston\nintroduced Clarke to the Bishop of Norwich and, when\nWhiston\nmoved on in\n1698\n(\neventually becoming\nNewton\n's assistant at Cambridge three years later\n)\n, Clarke replaced him as chaplain to the Bishop of Norwich. The Bishop gave Clarke the charge of Drayton, near Norwich, and around this time Clarke married Katherine Lockwood, daughter of the rector of Little Maningham in Norfolk. They had seven children, five of whom reached adulthood.\nClarke was considered the greatest\nmetaphysician\nin England when Locke died in\n1704\n. In\n1706\nNewton\nasked Clarke to translate his\nOpticks\ninto Latin. Clarke attracted great controversy with his religious views having few supporters. However he became rector of St Benet Paul's Wharf in\n1706\nand then of St James's, Westminster in\n1709\n. Further religious controversy followed and Clarke had to make various declarations of orthodox belief which seemed to be just enough to save him, although it was noted that he had not recanted. Let us give a few details on his religious beliefs and at the same time show how mathematics became part of the way that he put forward his arguments.\nIn Clarke's early religious writings there was nothing to arouse controversy. The first was\nThree practical essays on baptism, confirmation, and repentance\nof\n1699\n. He opposed high church ritual but he put himself somewhere in the middle of the range of views by also opposing the views of Calvin. He gained considerable fame as a philosopher when he delivered the Boyle lectures in\n1704\nand in an unprecedented move he was asked to give the Boyle lectures again in the following years since:-\n... persons of such abilities in theology, philosophy, and mathematics, are not to be commonly found.\nHis lectures of\n1704\nput strong arguments for natural religion while those of\n1705\ndealt with religious revelation. He believed that one first had to demonstrate the logical validity of religious belief before building on top of that the Christian beliefs concerning Christ. This separation in arguments concerning God and Christ led to him taking views which were at odds with official Christian doctrine. Clarke himself believed that mathematical argument was the supreme form of logical reasoning and he explained in the preface of\nDemonstration of the being and attributes of God\n(1705)\nthat he would argue:-\n... as near to mathematical as the nature of such a discourse would allow.\nIn this work Clarke also used arguments based on\nNewton\n's\nPrincipia\nas the basis of an attempted proof that an intelligent designer was necessary both to create and to maintain the universe.\nIn\n1709\nClarke went to Cambridge to undertake the public dispute necessary to receive the degree of doctor of divinity. In this disputation he again proved himself to be remarkably accomplished but some were left doubting that his views on the Trinity conformed with those of the mainstream. In\nThe scripture-doctrine of the Trinity: wherein every text in the New Testament relating to that doctrine is distinctly considered\n(1712)\nhe left nobody in doubt and argued that:-\n... the Father alone is self-existent, underived, unoriginated, independent ...\n[\nHowever\n]\nthe Son is not self-existent; but derives his Being and all his attributes from the Father ...\nThese views of course were close to those held by\nNewton\n, although he had been careful not to express them publicly. In making his position clear, Clarke had now made further advancement within the Church virtually impossible since he would have been asked to again subscribe to the Thirty-Nine Articles which required him to swear belief in the Trinity. As a consequence to would remain at St James's, Westminster, for the rest of his life.\nAfter the death of Queen Anne in\n1714\n, he became a close advisor to the Princess of Wales, who was to become Queen Caroline. He had weekly meetings with her and at her request he entered into dispute with\nLeibniz\nover the nature of space and time. Clarke defended Newtonian theory and corresponded with\nLeibniz\nmaking significant contributions to mechanics during the correspondence. Let us look briefly at the arguments put forward by\nLeibniz\nand at Clarke's reply\n(\nsee\n[\n6\n]\n,\n[\n9\n]\n,\n[\n11\n]\nand\n[\n13\n]\nfor interesting discusssions\n)\n.\nFirst\nLeibniz\nargued that\nNewton\n's description of space made God part of his own creation. Clarke replied:-\nInfinite space is immensity but immensity is not God and therefore infinite space is not God.\nLeibniz\nalso argued that\nNewton\nportrayed God as having made an imperfect universe since, according to\nNewton\n, God had to continually adjust the planets in their orbits. But, argued Clarke, if the universe ran forever without God's intervention there would be no need for God:-\n[\nW\n]\nhosever contends that the course of the world can go on without the continual direction of God, the Supreme Governor; his doctrine does in effect tend to exclude God out of the world.\nHe chose not to use the rather more risky argument put forward by\nNewton\nhimself, namely:-\n[\nI\n]\nf the world could go on to all eternity, then it might have gone on from all eternity, and that is all that the atheists contend for.\nThe final argument by\nLeibniz\nthat we consider is that\nNewton\n's idea of action at a distance, without any mechanical explanation, was an appeal to the occult. Clarke, in his reply, managed to use the idea of action at a distance to support a belief in human freedom and moral choice. The death of\nLeibniz\non\n14\nNovember\n1716\nin the middle of the correspondence rather handed victory to Clarke. He certainly chose to play it in that way, publishing the correspondence with a final reply of his own which summed up his position and gave him the final word.\nWhen\nNewton\ndied in\n1727\n, Clarke was offered the position as master of the Royal Mint but he turned it down, stating that it was not consistent with his role as a clergyman. Although most of his publications were on religion and metaphysics, one of his last works was\nOn the proportion of force to velocity in bodies in motion\npublished a year before his death. He died in the rectory of his church of St James's, Westminster, and was buried five days later in the chancel of the church.",
