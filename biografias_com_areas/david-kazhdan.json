  "biografia": "Let us note at the start that only since emigrating to the United States has the subject of this biography been known as\nDavid Kazhdan\n, for he was given the name\nDmitry Aleksandrovich Kazhdan\nand was known by this name when growing up in the Soviet Union. His name was also transliterated as\nKajdan\non some of his early papers. We, however, will use the name David Kazhdan throughout this biography.\nDavid Kazhdan was the son of Alexander P Kazhdan\n(1922\n-\n1997)\nand Rimma A Ivjanskaja\n(\nborn\n18\nOctober\n1920)\n. Alexander Kazhdan was born in Moscow on\n3\nSeptember\n1922\nand educated at the Pedagogical College of Ufa before receiving his PhD in\n1946\nfrom the Institute of History at the\nMoscow Academy of Sciences\n. At this time, because of Stalinist persecution, it was almost impossible for Jews to obtain university positions. Alexander Kazhdan began teaching in teacher training institutes but was later exiled to posts in provincial colleges. Alexander and Rimma Kazhdan were married in\n1944\n. Their only son, David Kazhdan, the subject of this biography, was born two months prematurely and was not expected to survive. But, against the odds, he did. He grew up, the only child in a Jewish but atheist family, with both parents academics. In the video\n[\n21\n]\nhe explained how he became interested in mathematics because of a stunt to skip school when he was in the fifth grade of his local elementary school:-\nWhen I was eleven, I decided that I didn't want to go to school every day. I asked my parents to give me permission to skip one day of school. They said, yes, if you do something reasonable. So I suggested to them that I'd learn chess. And for half a year I learned playing chess. And then they said it was not sufficient, choose something else. So I chose mathematics. This is how I started mathematics.\nFor a year, with his grandfather who had no secondary education, he quickly studied algebra, geometry and trigonometry. After this year in which he was self-taught, he joined a mathematics club run by two students who were studying mathematics at Moscow State University. This was a revelation; he quickly appreciated the beauty of the subject and also began to understand how different mathematical topics which at first sight looked totally unrelated, were in fact supporting each other. He became an avid reader of mathematics texts and in his frequent visits to book stores he would meet Naum Yakovlevich Vilenkin\n(1920\n-\n1991)\n. Vilenkin had studied at Moscow State University where he had been a student of\nA G Kurosh\n. He was the author of many books, both monographs on representation theory, harmonic analysis and special functions, as well as books on recreational mathematics and high school texts. Vilenkin was attending\nIsrail Moiseevic Gelfand\n's seminar at the time Kazhdan met up with him.\nI M Gelfand\nhad a son Sergei I Gelfand who was two years older that Kazhdan.\nGelfand\nwas about to start teaching his son advanced mathematics and was hoping to find another pupil to teach with him. Vilenkin told Kazhdan about this and gave him\nGelfand\n's phone number. Although Kazhdan was only about thirteen years old at the time, he phoned\nGelfand\nand said how keen he was to join Sergei in being tutored by\nGelfand\n. After being invited for an interview, during which he showed his extraordinary potential, Kazhdan began going to\nGelfand\n's home to learn advanced mathematics. He wrote\n[\n5\n]\n:-\nThose meetings opened the world of mathematics to me. The fundamental lesson\nGelfand\nimparted was the feeling that mathematics constitutes a unity, that even if in the apparent diversity of subjects falling within the discipline, such divisions should not be taken too seriously.\nKazhdan wrote his first paper with Sergei Gelfand when he was fourteen years old and Sergei was sixteen. The paper was\nAn integral equation connected with a pulse motion around a circle\n(\nRussian\n)\nand the review of the paper in\n[\n42\n]\nstates:-\nThe following problem is considered. An impulse is propagated along the circumference of a circle. The velocity of the propagation of the impulse depends on the position of the given point on the circumference which is given by the time\nÏ\n\\tau\nÏ\nelapsed since the last previous passage of the impulse through the given point. The object is to prove that if we are given\nÏ\n\\tau\nÏ\non the circumference in any way, and after that induce on the circumference one or several impulses, than their velocity will tend to some constant which is independent of the initial state. If the number of impulses is greater than one, then their limiting velocity will be the same for all impulses and the distances between the impulses will become equal. This problem has been considered in an earlier work\n[\nI M Gelfand\nand M L Cetlin\n(1960)]\n. The proof is accomplished under the assumption that the velocity function\nÏ\n(\nÏ\n)\n\\upsilon(\\tau)\nÏ\n(\nÏ\n)\nis strictly monotone and differentiable.\nThis is a remarkable work by two high school pupils. Kazhdan continued to mix with top mathematicians through clubs and seminars while still at school and continued to be almost intoxicated by the beauty of mathematics when, at the age of seventeen, he began studying at Moscow State University.\nAn important event occurred  in\n1966\nwhen the International Congress of Mathematicians took place in Moscow. The congress opened on\n16\nAugust\n1966\nwhen the president of the\nAcademy of Sciences of the Soviet Union\n,\nMstislav Vsevolodovich Keldysh\n, welcomed over\n4200\nmathematicians.\nIvan Georgievich Petrovsky\n, the rector of Moscow State University, was president of the Congress. It was an important event for Soviet mathematicians, particularly for Kazhdan, since contact with mathematicians outside the Soviet Union had been non-existent for many years but now they had the opportunity to have discussions with over\n2000\nmathematicians from the West. Particularly significant for Kazhdan was his contacts with\nMichael Atiyah\nand\nHarish-Chandra\n. He wrote\n[\n5\n]\n:-\nDespite the hermetically closed borders of the communist state, for young Soviet students such interactions offered access to cutting edge developments in the various realms of mathematics on an international scale.\nHe produced an amazing result while an undergraduate and published it in the paper\nOn the connection of the dual space of a group with the structure of its closed subgroups\n(\nRussian\n)\n(1967)\n. This paper introduces what today is called Kazhdan Property\n(\nT\n)\n. In the video\n[\n21\n]\nAlex Lubotsky said that Kazhdan:-\n... proved to be a prodigy. Let me illustrate this by an early example. When he was still a kid, I am not sure exactly what age but maybe about\n18\nor\n19\n, he had already become internationally famous for something which nowadays is called Kazhdan Property\n(\nT\n)\n. What is amazing about this Kazhdan Property\n(\nT\n)\nis that so many applications in so many different areas have been found, some of then by Kazhdan himself, but also by so many other people, and the most interesting thing is that they've even found application of the Property\n(\nT\n)\nin down-to-earth applied mathematics, or more precisely in computer science. There are nowadays some network communications which are built by the so called expander graphs and expander graphs were constructed for the first time using Kazhdan Property\n(\nT\n)\n.\nGregori Aleksandrovic Margulis\nwas a student at Moscow State University at the same time as Kazhdan and the two collaborated in solving an important open question. They published the joint paper\nA proof of Selberg's hypothesis\nin\n1968\n. In this paper they solved several outstanding problems, including proving a conjecture of\nSelberg\non the existence of unipotent elements in non-uniform lattices. In fact the paper proves two results which had been conjectured by\nSelberg\nand proved by him and others in some special cases. In a review,\nArmand Borel\ndescribes these results by\nMargulis\nand Kazhdan as \"basically elementary, but very ingenious.\"\nKazhdan received his diploma\n(\nequivalent to a B.Sc.\n)\nfrom Moscow State University in\n1967\n. He then undertook research advised by\nAlexandre Aleksandrovich Kirillov\nand was awarded a Kandidat Degree\n(\nequivalent to a Ph.D.\n)\nfrom Moscow State University in\n1969\n. While a research student at Moscow State University, Kazhdan married fellow mathematics student Helena Slobodkin\n(\nborn\n18\nSeptember\n1946)\n. Between\n1969\nand\n1974\nthree of their children, Eli, Dina and Misha, were born in Moscow. We note here that Misha Kazhdan received his bachelor's degree in mathematics from Harvard University in\n1997\n. He then earned a master's degree and Ph.D. in computer science from Princeton University in\n2001\nand\n2004\n, respectively. His Ph.D. thesis was\nShape Representations and Algorithms for\n3\nD Model Retrieval\n. He then joined the Whiting School of Engineering at Johns Hopkins University.\nDavid Kazhdan had grown up in an atheist family, and in his early years felt that religion was irrelevant and something left over from the middle ages. When in his early twenties a close friend converted to Christianity and Kazhdan became very aware of his Jewish roots and taught himself Hebrew and studied Aramaic Jewish texts. On the Sabbath he would attend the central synagogue in Moscow on Archipova Street and between the two morning prayer sessions he would deliver a talk on what he had learned. He was occasionally approached by KGB agents who attended the synagogue and tried to encourage him to join the KGB. Trying to bring up a family in the Jewish religion was not going to be easy with the restrictions against organised religion that the Soviet authorities imposed and this was a major factor in his desire to emigrate. Another factor must have been the fact that, despite his amazing achievements from a very young age, he worked as a researcher in the Laboratory of Mathematical Methods in Biology at Moscow State University from\n1969\n.\nIn\n1970\nthe International Congress of Mathematicians was held in Nice, France. Kazhdan attended this Congress and delivered the invited lecture\nArithmetic varieties and their fields of quasi-definition\nin Section C\n5\n- Groupes algÃ©briques fonctions automorphes et groupes semi-simples. The\n1974\nCongress was held in Vancouver, Canada and Kazhdan was again an invited speaker. The Russian authorities, however, did not allow him to attend the congress.\nKazhdan and his family went to the United States in\n1975\nand Harvard University offered Kazhdan a visiting professorship in the Mathematics Department. He writes\n[\n4\n]\n:-\nHarvard was a remarkably friendly and stimulating place. The Department integrated many different mathematical minds and offered a unique platform for interactions and collaborations between the faculty and the graduate student community. And more broadly, the world of Boston academia provided an auspicious environment for my work. I collaborated with various colleagues at Harvard and was exceptionally lucky to become a friend and collaborator of Romanian-born\nGeorge Lusztig\n. And beyond the academic satisfactions of my tenure at Harvard, my family quickly made Boston our \"home\". Relationships were built and long-lasting friendships forged.\nAfter two years as a visiting professor at Harvard, in\n1977\nhe was appointed as a full professor there. Daniel Kazhdan, the youngest of David and Helena's four children, was born in Boston in November\n1980\n.\nLet us note that Kazhdan's parents, Alexander and Rimma Kazhdan, emigrated to the United States in\n1979\nto reunite with their son. Alexander Kazhdan became a senior research associate at the Center for Byzantine Studies in Washington. From\n1983\nuntil\n1991\nhe was editor-in-chief of the\nOxford Dictionary of Byzantium\n.\nIn\n1990\nDavid Kazhdan was awarded a MacArthur Fellowship, known colloquially as the \"Genius Grant,\" which he held until\n1995\n. The MacArthur Foundation states that:-\n... the fellowship is not a reward for past accomplishment, but rather an investment in a person's originality, insight, and potential but the award is based on a track record of significant accomplishments.\nIn\n[\n18\n]\nthe MacArthur Foundation gives details of Kazhdan's most important contributions:-\nDavid Kazhdan is a mathematician known for his contributions to geometry, number theory, and mathematical physics. Kazhdan is concerned with the different ways symmetry occurs in nature and mathematics and his research focuses on algebraic aspects of analysis and geometric, representation theory.Â  His ideas have influenced work in the areas of automorphic representations, differential geometry, differential equations, representations of finite groups, and number theory.Â  His most celebrated result, the Kazhdan-\nLusztig\nconjecture, showed that most of the fundamental invariants of representation theory are really invariants of intersection cohomology. He is co-editor ofÂ 'Quantum Fields and Strings: A Course for Mathematicians'\n(1999)\n, and serves on the editorial board of theÂ 'Journal of theÂ American Mathematical Society'.\nAmerican Academy of Arts & Sciences\nadds\n[\n13\n]\n:-\nHe also discovered Kazhdan's property and jointly, with\nMargulis\n, proved\nSelberg\n's conjecture, fundamental in the theory of discrete groups. Kazhdan made important contributions to the theory of infinite-dimensional\nLie\nalgebras, quantum groups, representation theory of\nHecke\nalgebras,\nLanglands\nprogram, differential geometry, and model theory.\nPerhaps the most famous of the students that Kazhdan advised for a Ph.D. at Harvard was\nVladimir Voevodsky\nwho was awarded a Ph.D. in\n1992\nfor his thesis\nHomology of Schemes and Covariant Motives\n. The ideas in this thesis eventually led to work which saw\nVoevodsky\nawarded a\nFields\nMedal in\n2002\n.\nBut mathematics was not the only topic in which Kazhdan is a leading scholar. Itzhak David Goldberg explains in\n[\n23\n]\nthat in\n1976\nhe met David Kazhdan at Rabbi Joseph Soloveitchik's Sunday morning Talmud class at the Maimonides School in Brookline, Massachusetts:-\nI had just started my postdoctoral work in vascular biology at Harvard Medical School. I was immersed in a world of cutting-edge science, of empiricism. But on the weekends I left that world behind to engage with the preeminent rabbi and legendary philosophical scholar who promoted building bridges between traditional Orthodox Judaism and the modern world. And it was in Soloveitchik's class that I met David.\nBy the time we met, he had vast knowledge of both Hebrew and Aramaic Jewish texts. Soloveitchik enjoyed conversing with him and was amazed by his brilliance and his dedication to Jewish studies.\nOn a Sunday morning in\n1977\n, following Soloveitchik's Talmud class, David approached me. \"Do you want to learn together?\" he asked, in a pronounced Russian accent. I said yes, and we set up a daily schedule and started studying \"in friendship\", as partners.\nOver the following decades, we covered various topics and texts. Bible, tractates of Talmud, the writings of Maimonides and of Nachmanides, other philosophical texts. Initially, these daily sessions took place in the early mornings at the Tolner synagogue in Brookline ...\nKazhdan made many short visits to the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton: April-May\n1976\n; May-June\n1986\n; January\n1988\n; and June\n1988\n. From September\n1996\nto June\n1997\nhe was a Distinguished Visiting Professor at the School of Natural Sciences and the School of Mathematics during the 'Special Year in Quantum Field Theory' held at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. He gave the course\nIntroduction to QFT\nwhich was published in the two volume work\nQuantum Fields and Strings: A Course for Mathematicians\n(\nAmerican Mathematical Society,\n1999)\n. In a review of the book William Faris writes:-\nKazhdan's lectures in Part\n1\ntreat the axiomatic approach to quantum field theory. This is an attempt to prove general theorems about quantum fields that can be used in navigating the maze of specific examples.\nIn\n2002\nKazhdan was made Professor Emeritus at Harvard and emigrated to Israel to become a professor at the\nEinstein\nInstitute of Mathematics, part of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. His son, Eli Kazhdan was already working in Israel. He had graduated with a B.A. from Harvard University with honours in Government and International Relations. Eli had served in senior economic positions in the Israeli Government from\n1996\nto\n2002\n. He was the Chief of Staff in the Ministry of Industry & Trade, and then the Chief of Staff in the Ministry of Interior. He then became CEO of the economic development corporation, StartUp Jerusalem, which aimed at bringing investments to Jerusalem. Later he became CEO of CityBook Services.\nAlthough David Kazhdan had spent two sabbatical leaves in Israel, moving there on a permanent basis was not without its difficulties. Kazhdan was a native Russian speaker who had learnt English as a second language but now had to learn Modern Hebrew at the age of\n55\n. He was, however, given excellent support from the Department of Mathematics and his teaching was arranged making every possible allowance for his less than fluent Modern Hebrew. He took on a hectic life style getting up each morning at\n5\na.m., spending two hours on religious studies, then cycling on his bicycle to the\nEinstein\nInstitute of Mathematics to teach and undertake research. David Kazhdan and his son Eli would go for long,\n40\nto\n50\nmile, cycle runs. In\n2011\nDavid Kazhdan\n[\n22\n]\n:-\n... climbed Mount Kilimanjaro, the highest mountain in Africa. The mountain juts\n20\n,\n000\nfeet into the air is mountain climber's dream, and Kazhdan - his age notwithstanding - chose to climb Kilimanjaro to the summit on his own. After that, climbing Machu Picchu in Peru the following year was a breeze.\nOn\n6\nOctober\n2013\n, David Kazhdan was hit by a truck when riding his bicycle in Jerusalem. He was near the end of a\n44\n-mile cycle run with his son Eli. You can read details of this tragic accident at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nThree factors combined to see Kazhdan recover from this near fatal accident. As we have seen, he was extraordinarily fit, but also he was fortunate to be attended by an extremely skilled physician, and his absolute determination to succeed against the odds; these factors combined to bring him through.\nKazhdan has received many honours for his outstanding mathematical achievements. He was elected to the\nNational Academy of Sciences\n(\nWashington\n)\n(1990)\n, the\nIsrael Academy of Sciences and Humanities\n(2006)\n, the\nAmerican Academy of Arts & Sciences\n(2008)\n, and the Academia Europaea\n(2020)\n. He has received a number of major awards for his outstanding contributions to mathematics. These include: the Rothschild Prize\n(2010)\n; the Israel Prize\n(2012)\n; the EMET Prize\n(2016)\n; and the Shaw Prize\n(2020)\n. He received the EMET Prize:-\n... for his work in design of representation theory and its uses in algebra, algebraic geometry and number theory.\nThe award of the Shaw Prize\n2020\nwas made in equal shares to\nAlexander Beilinson\nand David Kazhdan:-\n... for their huge influence on and profound contributions to representation theory, as well as many other areas of mathematics.\nFor more information about these awards to Kazhdan, see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nThe\n6\nth European Congress of Mathematics was held in KrakÃ³w, Poland, and the Congress began on Monday\n2\nJuly\n2012\n. It was organised by members of the\nPolish Mathematical Society\nand staff from the Jagiellonian University in KrakÃ³w. Around\n1000\nmathematicians attended. Kazhdan was a plenary lecturer, delivering the lecture\nRepresentations of affine Kac-Moody groups over local and global fields\n. Kazhdan was also a plenary speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians in\n2022\ngiving the talk\nOn the Langlands correspondence for curves over local fields\n. Because of COVID-\n19\n, this Congress was a virtual event.\nLet us end this biography with comments on the Bible Code. The Bible Code, also known as the Torah Code, claims that predictions of events are coded into the text of the Torah. The claimed codes are typically: for some\nn\nn\nn\n, take characters\nn\nn\nn\napart, either forwards, backwards, diagonally etc. David Reagan claims in\n[\n36\n]\namazing things are found in the Book of Genesis using these codes. He also states:-\nThe research was checked and confirmed by Dr David Kazhdan, chairman of the Harvard mathematics department and by Harold Gans, a senior code specialist with the U.S. Army. Both concluded that the Torah Code actually exists and that it could not have occurred by chance or by human design.\nThe\nn\nn\nn\nused to find certain words is actually very large, often around\n5000\n. Barry Simon asked Kazhdan if he had really claimed that \"\nthe Torah Code actually exists and that it could not have occurred by chance or by human design.\"\nSimon writes in\n[\n38\n]\n:-\nSome presentations have made much of a letter of approbation signed by four distinguished mathematicians\n(\nJoseph Bernstein, then of Harvard, now of Tel Aviv University;\nHillel Furstenberg\nof Hebrew University; David Kazhdan of Harvard and\nIlya Piatetski-Shapiro\nof Tel Aviv University and Yale\n)\n.  Three of these are Orthodox and I'd be hard pressed to find a more distinguished group of Orthodox mathematicians.\nBut their letter is very carefully worded to state nothing more than that they find the Famous Rabbis experiment interesting and worthy of further study.  Professor Rips himself\n[\nwho undertook the Bible Code research\n]\ntold me that he didn't think any of them were convinced of its validity and that is certainly true of the two of them I know and consulted.  Indeed, Kazhdan's response to the presentation of his position on the above web site\n(\nKazhdan was the chairman of the Harvard Mathematics Department at the time the page was prepared\n)\nwas that \"I am sorry to see my position in such a distorted form.\"",
