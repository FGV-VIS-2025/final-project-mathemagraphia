  "biografia": "Vito Volterra\n's parents Abramo Volterra, a cloth merchant, and Angelica AlmagiÃ  were married on\n15\nMarch\n1859\n. The family were of Jewish origins. The name Volterra comes from the Tuscan town of Volterra where one of Vito's ancestor moved in the\n15\nth\ncentury, having originally come from Bologna. One of the Volterras had opened a bank in Florence while other members of the family were writers, collectors of books and manuscripts, and travellers. They had lived in various different cities but from the\n18\nth\ncentury there were Volterras living in Ancona. Vito, his parents' only child, named after his maternal grandfather, was born at exactly the time\n(\nMay\n1860)\nwhen Giuseppe Garibaldi set out to conquer Sicily and Naples and so to create a unified Italy. After victories in Sicily, Garibaldi quickly moved north in August\n1860\n. Ancona was at this time under the direct rule of the pope but Garibaldi's army besieged the town attacking it with missiles. Vito, aged about three months, was in his cradle when a missile fell close by destroying the cradle yet, by good fortune, baby Vito survived.\nSurviving this close call certainly was not the end of the young child's problems. His father Abramo  died when Vito was only two years old. The family was left without any means of financial support and only survived because Alfonso AlmagiÃ , a brother of Vito's mother, took care of them. They all moved from Ancona to Terni in the autumn of\n1863\nwhen Alfonso worked there for a railway company but in January\n1865\nhe became an official with the Banco d'Italia in Turin and at this stage Vito and his mother returned to Ancona. After only a short stay in Turin, Alfonso moved to Florence where he continued to work for the bank, and Vito and his mother joined him there. It was in this city that Vito spent most of his childhood, although he returned to Ancona for some long family visits, and it was in Florence that he received his education. His interest in mathematics started at the age of\n11\nwhen he began to study\nLegendre\n's\nGeometry\n. At the age of\n13\nhe began to study the\nThree Body Problem\nand made some progress by partitioning the time into small intervals over which he could consider the force constant. After elementary school, Vito studied at the lower secondary Dante Alighieri Technical School and later he spent three years at the\nGalileo Galilei\nTechnical Institute in Florence.\nSince his family were extremely poor, there was pressure on Vito to leave the\nGalileo Galilei\nTechnical Institute after one year of study and take a job. However, his determination to continue studying, supported by his uncle Edoardo, saw him continue. Edoardo, who had a degree in applied mathematics and civil engineering, had a firm which was involved in railway construction. Alfonso put pressure on Vito to join Edoardo's firm but Edoardo kept delaying to allow Vito to continue his education. One of Vito's mathematics teachers at the\nGalileo Galilei\nTechnical Institute was\nCesare ArzelÃ\nand he quickly realised that Vito was an extremely talented mathematician. The physics teacher, Antonio RÃ²iti\n(1843\n-\n1921)\n, became another important ally in Vito's bid to continue his education. RÃ²iti offered Vito a position teaching physics at the Istituto di Studi Superiori e di Perfezionamento in Florence in\n1877\n, so managing to prevent him from being forced by Alfonso to take a job at the Banco d'Italia. Volterra was able to proceed to the University of Pisa in the autumn of\n1878\n, enrolling in the faculty of Science. In the autumn of the following year he sat the competitive examination for entry to the Scuola Normale Superiore in Pisa and scored the highest possible marks. This meant he received a scholarship together with free board and lodgings. At the Scuola Normale he was taught by several inspiring teachers, the most influential being\nUlisse Dini\nand\nEnrico Betti\n. Volterra published three papers in\n1881\nbefore graduating, one on mathematical physics\nSul potenziale di un' elissoide eterogenea sopra sÃ¨ stessa\nâ\n(\nOn the potential of a heterogeneous ellipsoid upon itself\n)\nand two on analysis,\nAlcune osservazioni sulle funzioni punteggiate discontinue\nâ\n(\nSome remarks on discontinued dotted functions\n)\n, on pointwise discontinuous functions, and\nSui principii del calcolo integrale\nâ\n(\nOn principles of the integral calculus\n)\nwhich became important in the development of the history of integration. At Pisa he worked for his thesis advised by\nEnrico Betti\n, graduating with his laurea in\n1882\n. His thesis on hydrodynamics,\nSopra alcuni problemi di idrodinami\nâ\n(\nOn some problems in hydrodynamics\n)\n, included some results of\nGeorge Stokes\n, which Volterra had discovered later but independently.\nAfter graduating with his laurea, Volterra was appointed as\nBetti\n's assistant in December\n1882\n. He was named Professor of Rational Mechanics at Pisa in\n1883\nand immediately gained a reputation as a severe and demanding teacher. He was well liked by his colleagues, for example\nErnesto Pascal\nwho arrived in Pisa in\n1887\nwrote in a letter to a friend\n(\nsee\n[\n4\n]\n)\n:-\nProfessor Volterra is an angelic young man, of characteristic modesty.\nVolterra's mother Angelica had continued to live with her brother Alfonso while Volterra studied at Pisa and she continued to live in Florence until\n1887\nwhen she moved to Pisa and set up home with Volterra. His remarkable mathematical contributions were quickly recognised and he was awarded the gold medal of the\nNational Academy of Sciences of Italy\n(\nthe \"Academy of XL\"\n)\nin\n1887\n, he became a corresponding member of the\nAccademia dei Lincei\nand a member of the\nFrench Mathematical Society\nin\n1888\nand, three years later, he was elected to the\nMathematical Circle of Palermo\nand also named a Knight of the Order of the Crown of Italy. After Betti's death in\n1892\n, he occupied the Chair of Mathematical Physics at Pisa. In the same year he became dean of the Faculty of Science at Pisa and succeeded\nBetti\nat editor-in-chief of the journal\nNuovo Cimento\n. During these years while holding a chair at Pisa, Volterra had made a number of trips abroad. He visited\nHenri PoincarÃ©\nin Paris in\n1888\nand was invited to come to Paris again in the following year for the CongrÃ©s international de bibliographie des sciences mathÃ©matique. This proved an important event since it saw Volterra become a significant member of the international mathematical community. In\n1891\n, as a consequence of these newly established connections, he travelled to Germany spending a month at the University of GÃ¶ttingen and a few days at the University of Berlin. He met a number of leading German mathematicians on this trip including\nHermann Schwarz\nand\nLeopold Kronecker\n.\nAlthough he never formally applied for the position, he was offered the Chair of Higher Mechanics and Rational Mechanics at the University of Turin in July\n1893\n. It would appear that\nEnrico D'Ovidio\nwas behind the invitation. Volterra wrote to\nUlisse Dini\na few days later\n(\nsee\n[\n4\n]\n)\n:-\nMost esteemed Professor, I have come to look for you several times in recent days but I have never succeeded in finding you. I would like to tell you some news that I received the other day from\nSegre\n, that is, that the Faculty of Turin has called me there to succeed\nSiacci\n, who is going to Naples. This news reached me unexpectedly, and I have written to Turin saying that since it concerns a matter of importance I wanted to wait until I had had time to reflect on it.\nPisa tried to entice him to stay, while Turin tried hard to persuade him to accept their offer which Volterra eventually did. One of his new colleagues at Turin was\nGiuseppe Peano\nand, beginning in\n1895\n, the two mathematicians became involved in a dispute. This was an unfortunate affair which started as a priority dispute but became rather heated. The dispute did nothing to harm Volterra's reputation, if anything he came out of it rather well, and he continued to receive honours for his contributions. In particular, he was elected to the\nNational Academy of Sciences of Italy\n(\nthe \"Academy of XL\"\n)\nin\n1894\nand, in the same year, became a member of the board of the\nMathematical Circle of Palermo\n. He won the mathematics prize from the\nAccademia dei Lincei\nin\n1895\n. In\n1897\nhe attended the first International Congress of Mathematicians in ZÃ¼rich and there met\nPaul PainlevÃ©\nand\nÃmile Borel\nwho invited him to Paris in the following year. He made the visit and had useful discussions with\nHenri Lebesgue\n. The next International Congress of Mathematicians was held in Paris in August\n1900\nand Volterra was invited to give one of the four plenary lectures; he gave the lecture\nBetti, Brioschi, Casorati - Trois analystes italiens et trois maniÃ¨res d'envisager les questions d'analyse\nâ\n(\nBetti, Brioschi, Casorati - Three Italian analysts and three ways of looking at questions of analysis\n)\n.\nBy the time Volterra gave his lecture in Paris he was married. After a short engagement of one month, he married his second cousin Virginia AlmagiÃ , the daughter of Edoardo AlmagiÃ , on\n11\nJuly\n1900\n. They spent their honeymoon in Switzerland visiting places that Volterra knew from his visit for the International Congress in\n1897\n. He had also been appointed to the Chair of Mathematical Physics at Rome where he succeeded\nEugenio Beltrami\nwho had died in February of\n1900\n. Volterra took up the appointment in Rome in November\n1900\nand, in the following year, gave his inaugural lecture\nSui tentativi di applicazione delle matematiche alle scienze biologiche e sociali\nâ\n(\nOn  attempts to apply mathematics to the biological and social sciences\n)\nwhich discussed applications of mathematics to the biological and social sciences. His first child, a son, was born in\n1901\nbut died soon after birth. A second child, a daughter Luisa, was born in\n1902\nand in the same year his uncle Alfonso died. Let us continue to give Vito and Virginia Volterra's other children: Edoardo\n(\nborn\n1904)\n, Enrico\n(\nborn\n1905)\n, Gustavo\n(\nborn\n1906\nbut died after a few months\n)\nand Gustavo\n(\nborn\n1909)\n. Volterra was not in Rome when some of these children were born since to travelled much over these years. The summer of\n1901\nwas spent in England\n(\nLondon, Oxford and Cambridge\n)\n, in\n1902\nhe visited Germany\n(\nBerlin\n)\nas well as Denmark, Sweden and Norway. He received an honorary degree from the University of Christiana while there for the centenary of\nNiels Abel\n's birth. In\n1904\nhe was back in England when awarded an honorary degree by the University of Cambridge. He also attended the International Congress of Mathematicians in Heidelberg in August\n1904\nand four years later was a plenary speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Rome giving the address\nLe matematiche in Italia nella seconda metÃ  del secolo XIX\nâ\n(\nMathematics in Italy in the second half of the nineteenth century\n)\n. In\n1909\nhe gave a series of lectures at Clark University in Massachusetts, United States, and received an honorary degree from the university as part of its\n20\nth\nanniversary celebrations. In\n1912\nhe was in London for the\n250\nth\ncelebrations of the\nRoyal Society\nreceiving its Royal Charter - he had been elected as a fellow in\n1910\n. Also in\n1912\n, he went on a lengthy lecture tour of leading American universities. Let us now examine some of his important mathematical contributions.\nVolterra conceived the idea of a theory of functions which depend on a continuous set of values of another function in\n1883\n.\nHadamard\nwas later to introduce the word 'functional' which replaced Volterra's original terminology. In\n1890\nVolterra showed by means of his functional calculus that the theory of\nHamilton\nand\nJacobi\nfor the integration of the\ndifferential equations\nof dynamics could be extended to other problems of mathematical physics. During the years\n1892\nto\n1894\nVolterra published papers on\npartial differential equations\n, particularly the equation of cylindrical waves. His most famous work was done on\nintegral equations\n. He began this study in\n1884\nand in\n1896\nhe published papers on what is now called 'an integral equation of Volterra type'. He continued to study\nfunctional analysi\napplications to integral equations producing a large number of papers on composition and permutable functions. Let us quote from\n[\n66\n]\nregarding these contributions by Volterra:-\nThe theory of functionals as a generalization of the idea of a function of several independent variables was developed by Volterra in a series of papers published since\n1887\nand was inspired by the problems of the calculus of variations. These papers initiated the modern theory of functional analysis. They attracted attention at once from the foremost mathematicians of his time. Actually the name \"functional\" was introduced later by\nHadamard\nand has now replaced Volterra's original nomenclature. In developing this theory Volterra already followed a principle which guided him through many discoveries and which he called the passage from the discrete to the continuous. It was this principle which he applied to his celebrated researches on integral equations of Volterra's type. He considered heuristically the integral equations as a limiting case of a system of linear algebraic equations and then checked his final formulae directly. His procedure opened the way for\nFredholm\nand\nHilbert\nwho, however, investigated the limiting process itself.\nWorld War I broke out in\n1914\nbut, shortly after hostilities began on\n3\nAugust, Italy declared that it would not commit troops to the fighting. This was despite having an alliance with Germany and Austria-Hungary. Volterra spoke out strongly against Italy honouring its treaty with the Central Powers. Italy revoked this alliance on\n3\nMay\n1915\nand later that month declared war on Austria-Hungary. The day before war was declared Volterra repeated a request he had made in April to enlist:-\n... in technical or laboratory service or in another service of any form or nature whatsoever.\nVolterra became a lieutenant in the corps of engineers and was sent to the Central Institute of Aeronautics. He was given the task of determining how guns could be fired from dirigibles without causing them to catch fire. He was appointed as head of the Office of Inventions in\n1917\n. This coordinated contributions from the military, industry and the universities. It was renamed the Office of Inventions and Research in\n1918\n. After the War he returned to the University of Rome and his interests moved to mathematical biology. He studied the\nVerhulst\nequation and the logistic curve. He also wrote on predator-prey equations. Weinstein writes\n[\n66\n]\n:-\nA considerable part of the work of Volterra in the latter part of his life was devoted to the applications of mathematics to biology. The subject of these investigations was mainly the study of biological associations of animals of different species living together. In other words he was interested in a mathematical theory of the \"survival of the fittest.\" While there are today other methods of a stochastic nature, the work of Volterra still exerts a dominant influence on several modern and quite recent developments in mathematical biology.\nIn\n1920\nhe was invited to give a plenary address at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Strasbourg; this was his third invitation to be a plenary speaker. He gave the lecture\nSur l'enseignement de la physique mathÃ©matique et de quelques points d'analyse\nâ\n(\nOn the teaching of mathematical physics and some points of analysis\n)\n. Let us note that he was again invited as a plenary speaker at the\n1928\nInternational Congress of Mathematicians in Bologna where he gave the lecture\nLa teoria dei funzionali applicata ai fenomeni ereditari\nâ\n(\nThe functional theory applied to hereditary phenomena\n)\n.\nThe Italian Fascist movement had started around\n1921\nas a nationalist movement. Led by Benito Mussolini, the Fascists came to power in\n1923\nalthough at this time they did not adopt racial policies. Volterra fought against the Fascists in the Italian Parliament but continued to be a leading figure being elected the first president of the Italian National Council for Research in\n1923\nand, in the same year, elected president of the\nAccademia dei Lincei\n. By\n1926\nthe Fascists had abolished all opposition parties and Volterra felt he could not continue with these two roles, and resigned as president. By\n1928\nelections to Parliament had been abolished and the police began constructing a file on Volterra as being \"politically suspect\". He was subject to police surveillance from that time on. When Volterra refused to take the oath of allegiance to the Fascist Government in\n1931\n, which was required of all tenured and contracted professors, he was forced to leave the University of Rome. From the following year he lived mostly abroad, mainly in Paris but also Spain and other countries. For refusing to sign another oath to Fascism he was removed from the\nAccademia dei Lincei\nin\n1934\nand removed from the Istituto Lombardo di Scienze e Lettere in\n1938\nbecause he was Jewish. It was a sad end to his highly successful career. The Manifesto della razza\n(\nManifesto of Race\n)\nenacted by Mussolini in July\n1938\nstripped Jews of Italian citizenship and banned them from positions in banking, government, and education. By this time, two of Volterra's sons held university positions and they were deprived of these by the racial laws. Volterra advised his sons to go abroad and try to start a new life there. Enrico moved to the Untied States and became a professor of aerospace engineering at the University of Texas.\nVolterra was offered an honorary degree by the University of St Andrews in\n1938\nbut, although he wished to come, his doctor did not allow him to travel to Scotland to receive it.\nEdmund Whittaker\nwrites\n[\n68\n]\n:-\nIn December\n1938\nhe was affected by phlebitis: the use of his limbs was never recovered, but his intellectual energy was unaffected, and it was after this that his two last papers 'The general equations of biological strife in the case of historical actions' and 'Energia nei fenomeni elastici ereditarii' were published by the\nEdinburgh Mathematical Society\nand the\nPontifical Academy of Sciences\nrespectively. On the morning of\n11\nOctober\n1940\nhe died at his house in Rome. In accordance with his wishes, he was buried in the small cemetery of Ariccia, on a little hill, near the country-house which he loved so much and where he had passed the serenest hours of his noble and active life.",
