  "biografia": "Michele de Franchis\n's parents were Girolamo de Franchis and Matilde Viola. Michele attended the high school in Palermo and, after graduating, continued his education at the University of Palermo. There he was taught by\nGiovanni Battista Guccia\n. He was awarded his laurea in mathematics in\n1896\n, having been advised by\nFrancesco Gerbaldi\nwho had been appointed to the chair of analytic and projective geometry at the University of Palermo in\n1890\n. De Franchis was strongly influenced by\nGiovanni Battista Guccia\nwho was originally from Palermo, but had studied in Rome before returning to Palermo in\n1880\n.\nGuccia\n, who lectured to de Franchis at the university, set up the\nMathematical Circle of Palermo\nin\n1884\nmaking Palermo an important mathematical centre. The\nMathematical Circle\nplayed a large part in de Franchis's mathematical life and the first ten papers he wrote were all published in the\nRendiconti\nof the\nMathematical Circle\n. While he was a student, de Franchis became friendly with\nGiuseppe Bagnera\nwho was appointed as\nGerbaldi\n's assistant in\n1893\nwhile studying for his laurea in mathematics.\nThe first paper which de Franchis published, based on his thesis, appeared in two parts in\n1897\n. It was entitled\nSulla curva luogo dei contatti di ordine k delle curve d'un fascio colle curve di un sistema lineare\nâ\n(\nOn the locus of points of order k contact of the curves of a bundle of a linear system\n)\n. This was followed by:\nSopra una teoria geometrica delle singolaritÃ  di una curva piana\nâ\n(\nOn a geometric theory of the singularities of a plane curve\n)\n(1897)\n;\nSulla riduzione degli integrali estesi a varietÃ\nâ\n(\nOn  reduction of integrals extended to varieties\n)\n(1898)\nand\nRiduzione dei fasci di curve piane di genere\n2\nâ\n(\nReduction of bundles of plane curves of genus two\n)\n(1898)\n. After entering the competition for a chair, he was appointed as professor of Algebra and Analytic Geometry at the University of Cagliari in\n1905\n. He moved to the University of Parma in following year on being appointed professor of Projective and Descriptive Geometry. In\n1909\nhe was appointed to the University of Catania where he remained until\n1914\nwhen he returned to Palermo on being appointed to succeed\nGuccia\nin the chair of Analytic and Projective Geometry.\nThe\nMathematical Circle of Palermo\nhad been led by\nGuccia\nwho had built it into the largest mathematical association in the world. When he died in\n1914\nthe\nMathematical Circle\nhad over\n900\nmembers, the majority coming from outside Italy. The leading mathematicians of the day were members, for example in the early years of the\n20\nth\ncentury\nHenri PoincarÃ©\n,\nJacques Hadamard\n,\nDavid Hilbert\n,\nVito Volterra\n,\nFederigo Enriques\n,\nGuido Castelnuovo\n,\nCorrado Segre\n,\nGiuseppe Peano\n,\nTullio Levi-Civita\n,\nGregorio Ricci-Curbastro\nand\nLuigi Bianchi\nwere members. De Franchis succeeded\nGuccia\ntaking over production of the\nRendiconti\n, the journal of the Circle, which he directed from\n1914\nuntil his death in\n1946\n. However, the Mathematical Circle declined in importance over the following years. This was not the fault of de Franchis and his colleagues but rather a consequence of the difficult international situation due to World War I and its aftermath. Clashes between German and French members of the Mathematical Circle put its very existence in doubt. After World War I ended in\n1918\n,\nÃmile Picard\n, and other French mathematicians, demanded that all German members of the board of the Mathematical Circle be expelled. It is greatly to de Franchis's credit that he managed to maintain a society containing both French and German members. He was able to get support for his position from many leading mathematicians such as the Germans\nEdmund Landau\nand\nHermann Weyl\n, the Frenchmen\nMaurice FrÃ©chet\nand\nJacques Hadamard\n, the American\nGeorge D Birkhoff\n, and the Italians\nGaetano Scorza\n,\nLuigi Bianchi\n,\nTullio Levi-Civita\n,\nFrancesco Severi\n, and\nVito Volterra\n. The effort involved in keeping the\nMathematical Circle\na truly international society was huge and the affairs of the\nMathematical Circle\ntook up a great deal of de Franchis's time. Not surprisingly, his research output suffered as a result. For example, after writing obituaries of Guccia, de Franchis only published one paper\nSulle varietÃ  con infiniti integrali ellittici\nâ\n(\nOn infinite varieties with elliptic integrals\n)\n(1915)\nand one book\nCenni sui determinanti e sulle forme lineari e quadratiche\nâ\n(\nNotes on determinants and linear and quadratic forms\n)\n(1919)\nin the ten years following his appointment to Palermo. The monumental effort made by de Franchis to keep the\nMathematical Circle\nas one of the major mathematical societies in the world was somewhat in vain since, although the\nMathematical Circle\nmaintained a high international reputation, it was not well supported by the Italian authorities. De Franchis maintained a strong international presence not only through correspondence but also attending international conferences, for example he attended the International Congress of Mathematicians held at Toronto\n11\nAugust to\n16\nAugust\n1924\n.\nAll de Franchis's research contributions are in the area of\nalgebraic geometry\n, but he was one of the first to use analytic methods in this area. We have seen already that de Franchis's early work studied plane algebraic curves but after\n1900\nhis interests turned more towards global algebraic geometry, working in the main areas of the Italian school. His first major work in this area was\nSulla varietÃ  delle coppie di punti di due curve o di una curva algebrica\nâ\n(\nOn the variety of pairs of two curves or points of an algebraic curve\n)\n(1903)\n. In this he introduced an important new approach in which he used general properties of surfaces to give information about curves. He used these new methods to prove important results in\nSulle corrispondenze algebriche fra due curve\nâ\n(\nOn the algebraic correspondence between two curves\n)\nwhich was also published in\n1903\n. The methods which he introduced here became important in his future work, that of\nGiuseppe Bagnera\n, and that of\nFederigo Enriques\nand\nFrancesco Severi\n. De Franchis published another significant paper\nSulle superficie algebriche le quali contengono un fascio irrazionale di curve\nâ\n(\nOn the algebraic surface which contain an irrational bundle of curves\n)\nin\n1905\n. His work here, involving the existence of\nPicard\nintegrals of the second kind, was closely related to ideas which were being studied by\nCastelnuovo\nand\nEnriques\n.\nFrom\n1906\nto\n1909\nde Franchis worked in collaboration with\nGiuseppe Bagnera\non the study of irregular surfaces, obtaining fundamental results for the classification of hyperelliptic surfaces. For their outstanding work on the theory of hyperelliptic surfaces de Franchis and\nBagnera\nwon the Paris\nAcademy of sciences\n' Bordin prize in\n1909\nfor their classification of hyperelliptic surfaces. A hyperelliptic surface is an algebraic surface which can be rationally covered by an abelian surface. If not a ruled surface, it is a quotient of an abelian surface by a finite group of automorphisms. There is, however, a rather strange story attached to the\n1909\nBordin prize since the same prize was awarded in\n1907\nto\nFederigo Enriques\nand\nFrancesco Severi\nfor classifying hyperelliptic surfaces\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nStrange as it may seem that two couples get two prizes for the same theorem, instead of sharing one, this story is even more complicated, since the first version of the paper by\nEnriques\nand\nSeveri\nwas withdrawn after a conversation of\nSeveri\nwith de Franchis, and soon corrected.\nBagnera\nand de Franchis were only a little later, since they had to admit a restriction; their proof however was simpler ...\nThe papers de Franchis wrote with\nBagnera\nover this period are:\nSopra le superficie algebriche che hanno le coordinate del punto generico esprimibili con funzioni meromorfe quadruplamente periodiche di due parametri\nâ\n(\nOn  algebraic surfaces that have the coordinates of the generic point expressed with meromorphic quadruply periodic functions of two parameters\n)\n(1907)\n;\nSur les surfaces hyperelliptiques\nâ\n(\nOn hyperelliptic surfaces\n)\n(1907)\n;\nLe superficie algebriche le quali ammettono una rappresentazione parametrica mediante funzioni iperellittiche di due argomenti\nâ\n(\nThe algebraic surfaces which admit a parametric representation using hyperelliptic functions of two arguments\n)\n(1908)\n;\nSopra le funzioni algebriche che si lasciano risolvere con X,Y,Z funzioni quadruplamente periodiche di due parametri\nâ\n(\nOn the algebraic functions that can be solved with X, Y, Z quadruply periodic functions of two parameters\n)\n(1909)\n; and\nIntorno alle superficie regolari di genere zero che ammettono una rappresentazione parametrica mediante funzioni iperellittiche di due argomenti\nâ\n(\nOn the regular neighbourhood of zero generally admitting a parametric representation using hyperelliptic functions of two arguments\n)\n(1909)\n.\nHis teaching skills are noted in\n[\n3\n]\n:-\nIn Palermo, de Franchis, as well as being known as an excellent researcher, was known as an excellent teacher. His courses were marked by the clarity and rigour that gives so much quality and aesthetic value to his work. Nevertheless, even in Palermo, de Franchis did not have a sufficient number of students or of collaborators, apart from\nBagnera\n, so he could not, therefore, initiate the formation of his own school of mathematics. Instead, he himself represented the last and perhaps the high point. However, he represented in a completely appropriately way the highest level of achievement reached by the Italian school of algebraic geometry.\nTowards the end of his career, de Franchis published a number of books in collaboration with Giuseppe Bartolozzi\n(1905\n-\n1982)\n. Bartolozzi was advised by de Franchis who graduated in\n1930\nafter submitting his thesis\nSopra una corrispondenza asintotica fra superficie affini equidistanti\nâ\n(\nOn an asymptotic correspondence between similar equidistant surfaces\n)\n. Bartolozzi then served as de Franchis's assistant for several years and together they collaborated on the texts:\nTrigonometria sferica\nâ\n(\nSpherical trigonometry\n)\n;\nTrigonometria piana\nâ\n(\nPlane trigonometry\n)\n;\nAritmetica pratica\nâ\n(\nPractical arithmetic\n)\n;\nElementi di geometria\nâ\n(\nElements of Geometry\n)\n;\nElementi di algebra\nâ\n(\nIntroduction to Algebra\n)\n;\nElementi di analisi matematica per gli Istituti tecnici\nâ\n(\nElements of mathematical analysis for technical colleges\n)\n; and\nElementi di matematica finanziaria ed attuariale per gli Istituti tecnici commerciali\nâ\n(\nElements of financial and actuarial mathematics  for commercial technical institutes\n)\nwhich were all published in\n1937\n. Their final joint text was\nNozioni di geometria intuitiva per il ginnasio inferiore\nâ\n(\nOn intuitive geometrical notions for lower high schools\n)\n(1940)\n. These books were either aimed at students in all levels of secondary school or at students at a Technical Institute.  Bartolozzi had experience at teaching in secondary schools and a Technical Institute for, after being de Franchis's assistant at the university, he taught at such institutions for the rest of his career.\nThe rise of Fascism in Italy proved a disaster for the\nMathematical Circle of Palermo\n. Under de Franchis' leadership the society had struggled, as we pointed out above, through no fault of its leader. He had complained bitterly about the lack of support that the society had received from the Italian authorities although international bodies, such as the Rockefeller Foundation, continued to give strong support. However, the Fascist government, introduced a law in\n1935\nwhich limited any Italian society to having less than half as many foreign members as Italian members. This was a severe blow for the\nMathematical Circle\nwhich had built its fame on its international nature. Pressure was put on the society to remove board members who were \"unacceptable\" to the Fascist government. Also the\nRendiconti\ncould not publish papers from \"unacceptable\" mathematicians. De Franchis fought hard to maintain the\nMathematical Circle\nat the level that\nGuccia\nhad raised it to but he fully realised that this was no longer possible. External events also severely damaged the vitality of the school of mathematics at the University of Palermo. De Franchis was greatly saddened by these events over this unfortunate period.\nDe Franchis was honoured with election to the Accademia Gioenia di Catania\n(1909)\n, the Accademia Peloritana di Messina\n(1909)\n, the Accademia delle scienze, lettere ed arti di Palermo\n(1910)\n, and the\nAccademia dei Lincei\non\n15\nJuly\n1935\n. His name is remembered with the de Franchis theorem\n(\nsometimes called the de Franchis-\nSeveri\ntheorem\n)\nand the\nCastelnuovo\n-de Franchis theorem. The first of these was used in an important way by\nGerd Faltings\nin his proof of the\nMordell\nconjecture.\nLet us end this biography by using, as a summary of de Franchis's mathematical contributions, the review by Luca Chiantini of the Collected works of Michele de Franchis\n[\n1\n]\npublished in\n1991\n:-\nThis book contains a complete collection of the mathematical papers written by M de Franchis\n(\nPalermo,\n1875\n-\n1946)\n, one of the most interesting exponents of the Italian school of algebraic geometry at the beginning of the century. De Franchis's works\n(\nafter a few early papers devoted to the classification of linear systems on plane curves\n)\nare essentially concerned with the study of irregular surfaces, a central subject for the Italian school, with its many related topics\n(\ncorrespondences on curves, cyclic coverings, bundles of holomorphic forms\n)\n. The fundamental feature of de Franchis's approach consists of a solid mastering of projective techniques joined with a deep sensibility for transcendental methods, which is less evident in the other main mathematicians of the Italian school.  De Franchis introduced and used implicitly some of the most important tools of modern algebraic geometry, such as characteristic classes and the\nAlbanese\nmap. The use of both projective and transcendental techniques allowed him to find important improvements in the classification of surfaces; the\nCastelnuovo\n-de Franchis theorem\n(\nfor a surface S of arithmetic genus\np\na\n,\np\na\nâ¤\nâ\n1\np_{a}, p_{a} â¤  -1\np\na\nâ\n,\np\na\nâ\nâ¤\nâ\n1\nimplies S ruled\n)\nis a cornerstone in this theory; de Franchis's approach for the classification of hyperelliptic surfaces set the pattern for\nLefschetz\n's works on general abelian varieties. Some of de Franchis's results seem to suggest still future extensions which can reveal themselves to be useful for modern algebraic geometry.",
