  "biografia": "Magdalena MoujÃ¡n\nwas the daughter of Armando MoujÃ¡n and MarÃ­a Teresa OtaÃ±o Alberdi\n(1899\n-\n1989)\n. Teresa was the daughter of Pedro MarÃ­a OtaÃ±o Barriola\n(1857\n-\n1910)\nand his wife MarÃ­a Magdalena Alberdi Descarga\n(1863\n-\n1934)\n. Pedro MarÃ­a OtaÃ±o Barriola was a famous Basque poet whose four sons, Bernardo OtaÃ±o AlberdiÂ\n(1892\n-\n1959)\n, Bernardo OtaÃ±o Alberdi\n(1892\n-\n1959)\n, Juan Miguel OtaÃ±o AlberdiÂ\n(1894\n-\n1946)\nand JosÃ© Ignacio OtaÃ±o AlberdiÂ\n(1896\n-\n1982)\nwere all born in Spain before the family emigrated to Argentina in\n1898\n. MarÃ­a Teresa OtaÃ±o Alberdi, the mother of Magdalena, was born in PehuajÃ³, Argentina, on\n20\nSeptember\n1899\n. The town of PehuajÃ³ was proud of its literary figures with the streets and squares name for poets and writers.\nMagdalena MoujÃ¡n, the subject of this biography, was born in PehuajÃ³ sixteen years after the death of her grandfather, but she would become very influenced by his poetry and his Basque roots.\nMagdalena was given the nicknamed \"beltxa\" at home. This is the Basque word for \"black\". In fact her mother taught her the Basque language when she was a child so she grew up being bilingual in Basque and Spanish. She attended primary and secondary school in PehuajÃ³ which is a city in the province of Buenos Aires about\n470\nkm south west of the city of Buenos Aires. After graduating from High School, she entered the National University of La Plata. This university, in the town of La Plata which is on the coast south of Buenos Aires, began operating in\n1897\nbecoming a national university in\n1905\n.\nAt the National University of La Plata, MoujÃ¡n was fortunate to be taught by\nManuel Sadosky\nand\nLuÃ­s Antoni SantalÃ³\n.\nManuel Sadosky\nwas an Assistant in the Department of Mathematics in the Faculty of Physico-mathematical Sciences of the National University of La Plata and was in charge of the practical courses Higher Mathematics I and II\n(\ndifferential equations and analytical functions\n)\n.\nLuÃ­s SantalÃ³\nwas a leading Spanish mathematician who had left Spain for political reasons due to the Spanish Civil War. After a short stay in France, he took the advice of\nJulio Rey Pastor\nand went to Argentina in\n1939\n. There he served as a professor in the National University of the Littoral, the National University of La Plata and the University of Buenos Aires. MoujÃ¡n was also friendly with her talented fellow student\nRebeca Cherep\n(\nbetter known as\nRebeca Guber\nafter her marriage to JosÃ© Guber who was an engineering student at the National University of La Plata while MoujÃ¡n was studying there\n)\n. After her first degree MoujÃ¡n continued to undertake research in mathematical physics for a Ph.D. and she was awarded the degree in\n1950\n. She then taught mathematics, did some research in mathematics, and wrote some popular articles for the magazine\nMundo AtÃ³mico\nâ\n(\nAtomic world\n)\nbetween the years\n1952\nand\n1955\n. This magazine, published between\n1950\nand\n1955\n, contained articles on scientific topics such as mathematics, astronomy, health, and physics. Here are examples of her papers in\nMundo AtÃ³mico\nâ\n(\nAtomic world\n)\n:\nElectrodinÃ¡mica clÃ¡sica segÃºn J Wheeler y R Feynman\nâ\n(\nClassical electrodynamics according to J Wheeler and R Feynman\n)\n(1952)\n,\nDetectores fabricados en el paÃ­s\nâ\n(\nDetectors manufactured in the country\n)\n(1952)\n,\nLa teorÃ­a de grupos y sus aplicaciones en mecÃ¡nica cuÃ¡ntica\nâ\n(\nGroup theory and its applications in quantum mechanics\n)\n(1952)\n,\nCausalidad y azar en FÃ­sica, segÃºn Max Born\nâ\n(\nCausality and chance in physics, according to Max Born\n)\n(1953)\n,\nEl isomorfismo de Hermann Weyl\nâ\n(\nThe Hermann Weyl isomorphism\n)\n(1953)\n,\nIdeas sobre la realidad presentes en la fÃ­sica actual\nâ\n(\nIdeas about reality present in current physics\n)\n(1953)\n,\nLÃ³gica y fÃ­sica cuÃ¡ntica\nâ\n(\nLogic and quantum physics\n)\n(1955)\n,\nAlberto Einstein\n(1955)\n. We note that LuÃ­s SantalÃ³ was also a regular contributor to\nMundo AtÃ³mico\nâ\n(\nAtomic world\n)\n.\nJuan PerÃ³n had been elected president of Argentina in\n1946\n. He introduced reforms so that universities lost their autonomy and only his supporters could hold university posts. He supported\nMundo AtÃ³mico\nâ\n(\nAtomic world\n)\nand in fact contributed several articles to it himself. In\n1955\nthere was a coup that ousted PerÃ³n. He had begun to lose the support of the military and, after a failed coup in June\n1955\n, another in September\n1955\nsucceeded and PerÃ³n fled to exile in Spain. Although there was an unstable political situation over the following years, the universities regained their autonomy in\n1956\n. The new government saw\nMundo AtÃ³mico\nâ\n(\nAtomic world\n)\nas supported by PerÃ³n so it was closed down.\nAgustÃ­n DuraÃ±ona y Vedia\n(1904\n-\n1980)\nwas an Argentine mathematician who had graduated from the National University of La Plata in\n1927\nand then undertaken post-doctoral work at the universities of Berlin and GÃ¶ttingen. At this time he worked on pure mathematics and published papers in\n1926\nsuch as\nSobre producto de series sumables Borel\nâ\n(\nOn the product of Borel summable series\n)\nand\nUna demostraciÃ³n de un teorema de Lebesgue del cÃ¡lculo integral\nâ\n(\nA proof of a Lebesgue theorem of integral calculus\n)\n. In\n1947\nhe was appointed a full member of the National Academy of Exact, Physical and Natural Sciences of Buenos Aires. Like MoujÃ¡n, DuraÃ±ona y Vedia published in\nMundo AtÃ³mico\nâ\n(\nAtomic world\n)\n. His articles include:\nDonde se trata de matemÃ¡ticas y matemÃ¡ticos\nâ\n(\nWhere it deals with mathematics and mathematicians\n)\n(1951)\n,\nCiencia y metafÃ­sica\nâ\n(\nScience and metaphysics\n)\n(1952)\n,\nLa lÃ³gica cuÃ¡ntica\nâ\n(\nQuantum logic\n)\n(1953)\n,\nHenri PoincarÃ© - Centenario de su nacimiento\nâ\n(\nHenri PoincarÃ© - centenary of his birth\n)\n(1955)\n.\nIt was around\n1957\nthat DuraÃ±ona y Vedia became interested in applying mathematics to real life problems and he developed methods in operations research. He thought that his best route for support was through the armed forces and, beginning in\n1957\n, gave a course at the Higher Technical School of the Army. He made a proposal to the Board of Scientific Research and Experimentation of the Armed Forces to set up an \"Operations Research Group\", which he would lead himself, and he proposed that it be composed of three other members: Magdalena MoujÃ¡n OtaÃ±o, Horacio C Reggini, a structural engineer, and Isidoro MarÃ­n, a civil engineer. The Operations Research Group began its activities on\n1\nDecember\n1957\n. Also in\n1957\nDuraÃ±ona y Vedia and MoujÃ¡n OtaÃ±o had produced a publication for the National Atomic Energy Commission entitled \"Operations Research\". They write that their aim is:-\n... to highlight the importance of the discipline in the management of companies of the most diverse nature.\nAfter PerÃ³n was ousted by a coup in\n1955\na freedom of education act was brought in which allowed the creation of private universities. In\n1956\n, the bishops of Argentina decided to create the Catholic University of Argentina and it was formally founded on\n7\nMarch\n1958\n. MoujÃ¡n was involved in the establishment of the Faculty of Physical, Mathematical and Engineering Sciences in the Catholic University of Argentina and, at the end of\n1959\n, was appointed as a full professor in the Faculty. AgustÃ­n DuraÃ±ona y Vedia became the first dean of that Faculty.\nIn\n1961\nMoujÃ¡n became a member of the Argentine Atomic Energy Commission. She then was able to use Clementina, the first computer to be installed in Argentina, to numerically solve two problems involving systems of differential equations. Clementina, a Ferranti Mercury computer so called because it had been programmed to play the song\nOh My Darling, Clementine\n, was installed in the Computational Institute of the University of Buenos Aires and began operating on\n15\nMay\n1961\n. MoujÃ¡n knew most of the members of the team running Clementina which was headed by\nManuel Sadosky\n.\nRebeca Guber\nand\nCecilia Berdichevsky\n. The Argentine Atomic Energy Commission was working on the RA-\n1\nreactor, the first reactor to start up in all of Latin America and the southern hemisphere. MoujÃ¡n was brought on to the team to strengthen it but before starting work on this project, she had to take courses on the theories of radiochemistry, electronics and reactors.\nArturo Illia had become President of Argentina following elections in June\n1963\n. He tried to split the PerÃ³nists, who controlled the unions, from their exiled leader PerÃ³n. The PerÃ³nists reacted by supporting a coup against President Arturo Illia in June\n1966\nand General Juan Carlos OnganÃ­a, the commander in chief of the army, took control of the country. MoujÃ¡n did not support General OnganÃ­a and had to resign her university position. After a few years she returned to university teaching but from this time on she also became a science fiction writer. She wrote under the pseudonym Inge Matquim and soon achieved fame winning joint first prize at the major Argentine Science Fiction Convention Mardelcon held in Mar Del Plata. It was held between\n26\nand\n28\nJuly\n1968\nand MoujÃ¡n was joint winner of the story contest with\nLos HuÃ¡queros\nâ\n(\nThe grave robbers\n)\n.\nOne can see by looking at the references that we give for this biography of MoujÃ¡n that she is better known as a writer of science fiction than she is as a mathematician. This probably would not be the case but for her article\nGu ta Gutarrak\nâ\n(\nUs and ours\n)\n. This is\n[\n12\n]\n:-\n... the story told of the origin of the Basque people as the result of a paradoxical travelling in time by a group including a present-day Basque scientist - among whom was the authoress, of course, resolving by chance the mystery that at present still veils this people and their language.\nMoujÃ¡n wrote the article in\n1968\n; it was inspired by a poem with the same name written by her grandfather Pedro MarÃ­a OtaÃ±o Barriola in\n1899\n. She submitted it to the Spanish magazine\nNueva DimensiÃ³n\nâ\n(\nNew dimension\n)\nand it was accepted in\n1970\n. Publication, however, was stopped by President Franco's regime with the Court of Public Order ordering the magazine be withdrawn from the market. They argued that the content of the story jeopardised the unity of Spain. Domingo Santo writes in\n[\n13\n]\n:-\nFrom there, pandemonium broke out. In the United States, Donald A Wollheim, owner of DAW Books and one of the most influential personalities in the field of science fiction in his country, as soon as he heard the news, mobilised all the science fiction fan clubs and mobilised the fandom to send strong letters of protest to the Spanish embassy in the United States for this \"unacceptable attack on freedom of expression.\" Harlan Ellison, who since the beginning of 'Nueva DimensiÃ³n' had given us his most enthusiastic support and collaboration, and who at that time collaborated assiduously with a series of national television networks, as soon as he knew what had happened he told us that he was going to prepare a whole series of special programmes on \"the oppression of intellectual freedom in that beloved country.\" The author herself sent to the Ministry of Information and Tourism an extensive curriculum vitae of hers in which she demonstrated without a doubt that her personal status, scientific and intellectual, was far beyond and far above separatism and attacks.\nLet us quote a little from\nGu ta Gutarrak\nâ\n(\nUs and ours\n)\n[\n11\n]\n:-\nThe Baskos\n(\nit is not an error, it is the correct spelling\n)\nwe have nothing racist. We are not a race, but a species. A species that, when mixed with the other, continues to result in pure baskos. ... It is known that when we do not like a government, we emigrate. In general, violence displeases us, we are peaceful people, enemies of killing, especially if it is not with a bare hand. Generally those of us who emigrate go to the Americas. That has been my case, and Jainkoa\n(\nor Jaungoikoa, the Lord who is up there\n)\nhas punished me for wanting to be so rich, since I have always been alone. Because you have to see that the Baskos born here are different. It must be the abundance of flat and fertile land, the Basko is from the mountains, that's why many Baskos here have degenerated into ranchers, and later into well-to-do children, people without the virtues of the race.\nMarta Macho Stadler, who has a doctorate in mathematics, tells us that MoujÃ¡n puts quite a lot of science into her story\n[\n16\n]\n:-\nIn this funny story, one of the protagonist's sons - Xaviertxo, who is gifted - becomes a physicist to \"study the structure of the space-time continuum.\" His knowledge allows him to build a time machine - baptised as 'Pimpilimpausa'\n(\nbutterfly, in Basque\n)\n- with the help of his little sister - Malentxo - who invents a new logic, one necessary to avoid paradoxes produced by the jumps in time. This machine represents \"... the great revolution in physics, something much more important than relativity, and than quantum theory and than the atomic bomb ...\".\nGu ta Gutarrak\nâ\n(\nUs and ours\n)\nwas replaced in\nNueva DimensiÃ³n\nNo\n14\nby the comic 'Formicology' and the issue was reprinted. Although the Court of Public Order threatened to bring\nNueva DimensiÃ³n\nto trial over their attempt to publish, in fact no trial ever took place. Subsequently, Nueva DimensiÃ³n published two other stories by MoujÃ¡n:\nBicho'e parra en orbit\nâ\n(\nBicho'e parra in orbit\n)\n(\nNueva DimensiÃ³n\nâ\n(\nNew dimension\n)\n18)\nand\nEl lagarto rojo\nâ\n(\nThe red lizard\n)\n(\nNueva DimensiÃ³n\nâ\n(\nNew dimension\n)\n101)\n. Following Franco's death in\n1975\nit was thought possible to publish\nGu ta Gutarrak\nâ\n(\nUs and ours\n)\nand it appeared in\nNueva DimensiÃ³n\nâ\n(\nNew dimension\n)\n114\nin\n1979\n. Note the choice to publish what should have been in No\n14\nappeared in No\n114\n.\nLet us return to MoujÃ¡n's mathematical career. We quote from her colleague and collaborator Jorge E Sagula\n(\nsee\n[\n7\n]\n)\n:-\nIn the\n1970\ns, already based in the city of La Plata, she was on the staff at the Faculty of Applied Mathematics of the Catholic University of La Plata, particularly teaching subjects of higher years in the Bachelor of Applied Mathematics and in the Bachelor of Statistics.\nI met Dr Moujan OtaÃ±o in\n1980\n, while she was teaching Applied Mathematics at the Catholic University of La Plata. We worked together on many projects: research, articles, books\n(\nfor example: \"Fundamentals of Computational Mathematics\", published in the city of La Plata in\n1992)\n, stories, sharing learning languages, for example, Russian; sharing direction and co-direction of thesis students and research projects, among other major topics.\nThe last stage of teaching, as Full Professor in the Statistics and Systems Division, was carried out at the National University of LujÃ¡n, particularly at the Chivilcoy Regional Center, responding to the proposal that I formulated in\n1989\n.\nWhen Magdalena left this world on\n16\nJuly\n2005\n, twenty-five years after we met, we were united by a superior relationship, a strong family and professional bond. It took me more than\n6\nmonths to accept her departure, but she is continually in my memory.\nMoujÃ¡n died at the age of\n79\nin a hospital in Mar del Plata. She asked to be buried next to his grandfather in the cemetery of Mar del Plata.",
