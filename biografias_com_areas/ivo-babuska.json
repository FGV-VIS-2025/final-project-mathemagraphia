  "biografia": "Ivo Babuska\nlived through difficult times in Czechoslovakia as he was growing up. The German invasion of the west of the country in September\n1938\nwas followed six months later by the whole country being taken over by Germany at the start of World War II. Babuska was thirteen years old at this time and most of his secondary education, therefore, took place under German occupation. Only after the war ended in\n1945\nwas he able to begin his university education.\nBabuska studied civil engineering at the Czech Technical University in Prague and was awarded a Dipl. Ing in\n1949\n. He undertook research in engineering, advised by F Faltus, and was awarded a Dr. Tech. by the Faculty of Civil Engineering of the Czech Technical University in\n1951\n. However, simultaneously with this research in engineering, Babuska was a mathematics student at the Central Mathematical Institute in Prague studying under Vladimir Knichal. While Babuska was studying at the Institute, its name changed in\n1953\nto the Mathematical Institute of the\nCzechoslovak Academy of Sciences\n. At the Mathematical Institute, in addition to Knichal, he was strongly influenced by\nEduard Äech\nwho was appointed Director of the Central Mathematical Institute in\n1950\n, and Director of the\nCzechoslovak Academy of Sciences\nin\n1952\n. In\n1955\nBabuska was awarded his Candidate's degree\n(\nequivalent to a Ph.D.\n)\n.\nGiven Babuska's training, coming first to engineering and, slightly later to mathematics, it is no surprise to see his publications being in the engineering area but become more slanted towards advanced mathematical techniques to solve engineering problems. His first papers, all written in Czech, were\nWelding stresses and deformations\n(1952)\n,\nPlane elasticity problem\n(1952)\n,\nA contribution to the theoretical solution of welding stresses and some experimental results\n(1953)\n,\nA contribution to one method of solution of the biharmonic problem\n(1954)\n,\nSolution of the elastic problem of a half-plane loaded by a sequence of singular forces\n(1954)\n,\n(\nwith L Mejzlik\n)\nThe stresses in a gravity dam on a soft bottom\n(1954)\n,\nOn plane biharmonic problems in regions with corners\n(1955)\n,\n(\nwith L Mejzlik\n)\nThe method of finite differences for solving of problems of partial differential equations\n(1955)\n, and\nNumerical solution of complete regular systems of linear algebraic equations and some applications in the theory of frameworks\n(1955)\n.\nHis\n1954\npaper investigating stresses in a gravity dam was a direct consequence of a project that he led between\n1953\nand\n1956\non using computational techniques to examine the technology involved in building the Orlik Dam on the Vltava River about\n80\nkm from Prague. This river, the longest in the Czech Republic, is a major source of hydroelectric power with several important dams creating artificial lakes. The Orlik Dam\n[\n6\n]\n:-\n... is a gravitational concrete dam\n91\nm high. The group, consisting of civil engineers, material scientists, mathematicians, and desk calculator operators, concentrated on the technology without artificial cooling, which is usually used to remove the heat created during the hardening of concrete. All the computations were carried out on mechanical desk calculators.\nBasically, the mathematical problem Babuska's group had to solve was to find a numerical solution to a nonlinear partial differential equation.\nIn\n1955\n, after the award of his doctorate, Babuska was appointed as head of the Department of Constructive Methods of Mathematical Analysis of the Mathematical Institute of the\nCzechoslovak Academy of Sciences\n. In the same year, in collaboration with Karel Rektorys and FrantiÅ¡ek Vycichlo, he published his first book\nThe mathematical theory of plane elasticity\n(\nCzech\n)\n. A German translation was published in\n1960\n. FrantiÅ¡ek Kroupa writes in a review of the original Czech edition:-\nThe book is devoted to the application of the theory of functions of a complex variable to solving plane problems of the classical mathematical theory of elasticity\n(\nfor static problems without the effect of body forces\n)\n. From the mathematical point of view it deals with the special method of solving a biharmonic equation for given boundary conditions. The book gives and further develops some of the results of N I Muskelishvili and collaborators. An original contribution is the axiomatic construction of the fundamentals of plane elasticity, the accuracy and generality of the mathematical procedures and some new numerical methods of solution.\nIn the following year,\n1956\n, Babuska founded the journal\nApplications of Mathematics\n(\nApplikace Matematiky\n)\n. In\n1960\nBabuska was awarded a Dr Sc.\n(\nthe highest possible degree in Czechoslovakia, equivalent to a D.Sc.\n)\nby the\nCzechoslovak Academy of Sciences\n. His next important book, published in collaboration with Milan PrÃ¡ger and Emil VitÃ¡sek in\n1964\n, was\nNumerical Solution of Differential Equations\n(\nCzech\n)\n. It was translated into English and published under the title\nNumerical processes in differential equations\ntwo years later.\nRichard Hamming\nreviewed the English translation and writes:-\nThis book shows both how much mathematics has to contribute to computing when competent mathematicians actually look at what computing is\n(\nrather than treating it as if it were a branch of mathematics\n)\n, and how much they can miss the current temper of computing. ... They make frequent experimental verifications of their theories, thus showing that they regard computing as a science whose results are to be accepted or rejected by the final authority of experience. ... The book is a significant contribution.\nThe political situation in Czechoslovakia has not been mentioned up to now in Babuska's biography since it has played a relatively small part. The Communists had seized control of the country in\n1948\nand it was under strong Soviet influence over the following years. Mathematics was allowed to develop without interference, however, and the applied and computational methods developed by Babuska found favour. Beginning in\n1964\nreformers had won many concessions which became more clear-cut in early\n1968\nwhen the country began to implement \"socialism with a human face\". The reforms came to a sudden end, however, in August\n1968\nwhen Soviet tanks rolled into Prague. Babuska had just been appointed as a professor at the Charles University of Prague but, given the political situation, he travelled with his family to the United States where he spent a year as a visiting professor at the Institute for Fluid Dynamics and Applied Mathematics at the University of Maryland at College Park. He was given a permanent appointment as a professor at the University of Maryland in the following year and he held this position until\n1995\n. He was then appointed Professor of Aerospace Engineering and Engineering Mechanics, Professor of Mathematics, and appointed to the Robert Trull Chair in Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin. Although now over\n85\nyears of age, he continues to hold these positions.\nAfter coming to the United States, Babuska became the world-leading expert in finite element analysis. The authors of\n[\n2\n]\nsummarise his important contributions to this area:-\nDuring his\n27\nyear career at the University of Maryland, Professor Babuska established himself as the unquestionable leader of the international finite element community. In his landmark paper in\n1971\n, Ivo introduced the discrete inf-sup condition, generalizing the results of J Cea and R Varga, and setting the theoretical framework for stability and convergence analysis of arbitrary linear problems. Three years later, F Brezzi reinforced the formalism for problems with constraints, and the name of the famous discrete BB condition was coined. ... Ivo has had a unique ability to foresee the development of the field of finite elements. He has been the force behind many developments in this field. His work with W Rheinboldt on a-posteriori error estimation has essentially started the field on adaptive finite element methods. In a landmark paper in\n1979\nwith\nB Kellogg\nand J PitkÃ¤ranta, the effect of h-adaptivity on the convergence rates for problems with singularities was explained. In the late seventies, Barna Szabo convinced Ivo to reexamine the then established concept of higher order methods, and the p-version of the Finite Element Method was born. The p-method turned out to be much less sensitive to incompressibility constraints\n(\nwork with M Vogelius\n)\nand locking effects in the analysis of thin-walled structures. The monograph on the p-method with B Szabo\n(1991)\nreaches far outside of the constraints of the mathematical community and has become a standard reference for engineers practicing higher order methods.\nThe monograph referred to in this quote, written in collaboration with Barna Szabo, is\nFinite Element Analysis\n(1991)\n. The authors write in the Preface:-\nOur purpose in writing this book is to introduce the finite element method to engineers and engineering students in the context of the engineering decision-making process. Basic engineering and mathematical concepts are the starting points. Key theoretical results are summarized and illustrated by examples. Focus is on the developments in finite element analysis technology during the\n1980\ns and their impact on reliability, quality assurance procedures in finite element computations, and performance. The principles that guide the construction of mathematical models are described and illustrated by examples.\nThe reviewer\n[\n5\n]\nwrites:-\nNumerous books on the finite element method with a variety of objectives have appeared recently, so many that it would be quite lengthy to compare even a representative number of them. The present book has extensive detail with regard to examples, and its coverage of topics in linear elasticity is exhaustive. Both of these are essential for the book to be successful with an engineering audience.\nRichard Scott writes in a review:-\nI like this book. It is a very nice, and somewhat unique, blend of theory and engineering practice. ... I think the authors have succeeded admirably in their goals and I recommend the text for serious consideration for a first graduate course on finite elements.\nIn\n2001\n, in collaboration with Theofanis Strouboulis, Babuska published\nThe finite element method and its reliability\n. Carsten Carstensen writes:-\nThe reliability of a given numerical approximation is one essential task in applied science and engineering. Here, two leading scientists devote six chapters on eight hundred pages to it and fix the state of the art of rigorous 'a posteriori' finite element error analysis.\nBabuska, with Ivan HlavÃ¡cek and Jan Chleboun, published\nUncertain input data problems and the worst scenario method\nin\n2004\n.\nAmong the many other services to mathematics which Babuska has given, we mention the many journals which have benefited by his accepting a position on their editorial board: Communications in Applied Analysis; Communications in Numerical Methods in Engineering; Computer & Mathematics; Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering; Computers and Structures; Communications in Applied Analysis; International Journal for Numerical Methods in Engineering; Modelling and Scientific Computing; Numerical Mathematics - A Journal of Chinese Universities; Numerical Methods for Partial Differential Equations; and Siberian Journal of Computer Mathematics.\nBabuska has received many awards for his contributions: the Czechoslovak State Prize for Mathematics\n(1968)\n; the Humbolt Senior US Scientist Award of Federal Republic of Germany\n(1976)\n; the Medal for Merit in the Development of Mechanics of the Czech Society for Mechanics\n(1993)\n; and the\nGeorge David Birkhoff\nPrize in Applied Mathematics awarded jointly by the\nAmerican Mathematical Society\nand the\nSociety for Industrial and Applied Mathematics\n(1994)\n:-\n... for important contributions to the reliability of finite element methods, the development of a general framework for finite element error estimation, and the development of p and h-p finite element methods...\nIn\n1995\nBabuska was awarded the\nJohn von Neumann\nAward by the Association for Computational Mechanics for:-\n... extraordinary contributions and the breadth and depth of his work, and their importance to the broad fields of computational mechanics\nBabuska ended his Acceptance Speech, which examined the legacy of\nvon Neumann\n, with these words:-\nMr President, I would like to thank you again for the great honour that has been bestowed upon me and to express my opinion that nearly\n40\nyears after the death of\nvon Neumann\n, a towering scientific figure of the\n20\nth\nCentury, we, who work in computational mechanics, can still learn tremendously from the legacy, ideas and philosophy of\nJohn von Neumann\n.\nThe\nUnion of Czech Mathematicians and Physicists\nmade him an honorary member in\n1996\nand, in the same year, presented him with their Commemorative Medal. He received the\nBolzano\nMedal from the\nCzech Academy of Sciences\nin\n1997\nand the Honorary Medal \"De Scientia et Humanitate Optime Meritis\" from the same Academy in\n2006\n. He has received honorary degrees from the University of Westminster, London\n(1996)\n, Brunel University, London\n(1996)\n, Charles University, Prague\n(1997)\n, and the Helsinki University of Technology\n(2000)\n. He was elected a fellow of the International Association of Computational Mechanics in\n2002\nand of the World Innovation Foundation in\n2004\n. He was elected a member of the European Academy of Sciences in\n2003\nand of the National Academy of Engineering in\n2005\n. The International Astronomical Union named asteroid No.\n36030\n\"Babuska\" in his honour in\n2002\n.\nIvo Babuska was married to Renots.",
