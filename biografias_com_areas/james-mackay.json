  "biografia": "James Mackay\n's father, James Mackay, was a railway signalman from Clashfern in Sutherland. Later in his life Mackay spoke of the important role his father played showing great courtesy and gentleness. James' mother was Janet Hymers. He was brought up in a family in which the strict disciple of the Free Presbyterian Church was observed, and the importance of Bible study and observance of the Sabbath was the way of life. His father had a deep interest in theology and, with his excellent memory, was very knowledgeable on the subject. It became an important part of the young boy's life and, in later years, he continued to be a devoted member of the Free Presbyterian Church.\nMackay attended George Heriot's School in Edinburgh and then entered the University of Edinburgh where he studied mathematics and natural philosophy\n(\nas physics was known in the university at that time\n)\n. In\n1947\nhe was awarded a scholarship to undertake further study in mathematics at the University of Cambridge and in the following year he graduated from Edinburgh with an MA with Honours in Mathematics and Natural Philosophy. At this stage, rather than take up the scholarship in Cambridge, Mackay took a lectureship in the Mathematics Department of the University of St Andrews. He taught there for two academic years,\n1948\n-\n49\nand\n1949\n-\n50\n. His professor at St Andrews was\nTurnbull\n, the Regius Professor of Mathematics, and he became a colleague of\nDan Rutherford\n. In fact these two years were the final two years of\nTurnbull\n's tenure of the Regius Chair, for he retired in\n1950\n. The classes at this time were small, and in\n1948\n-\n49\nMackay taught a final year honours class of six mathematics students\n(\none of whom went on to become a university lecturer researching in algebra\n)\n.\nAfter these two years teaching mathematics at St Andrews, Mackay went to Trinity College, Cambridge to take up the scholarship he had been awarded to study mathematics there. He received another scholarship in his second year,\n1951\n-\n52\n, and graduated with a BA from Cambridge in\n1952\n. He then changed topic and, returning to Edinburgh to study law, he was awarded the degree of LLB\n(\nwith distinction\n)\nin\n1955\n. In the same year he was admitted to the Faculty of Advocates, the members of the bar of Scotland. At this stage he took on a variety of both civil and criminal cases. Making use of his mathematical skills he specialised in complex tax cases where these skills could be put to good use. In\n1958\nMackay married Elizabeth Gunn Hymers; they had three children, a son James born in\n1958\n, and two daughters Elizabeth Janet born in\n1961\nand Shona Ruth born in\n1968\n.\nIn\n1965\nMackay was appointed Queen's Counsel and he was Sheriff Principal, Renfrew and Argyll, from\n1972\nto\n1974\n. He was vice-Dean of the Faculty of Advocates from\n1973\nto\n1976\nwhen he was elected Dean of the Faculty, a position he held until\n1979\n. In\n1979\n, Mackay was appointed Lord Advocate, the senior law officer in Scotland, and was created a life peer becoming Baron Mackay of Clashfern, of Eddracchillis in Sutherland. He took this designation because of his father's birthplace. Mackay was Lord Advocate until\n1984\nwhen he became a Senator of the College of Justice in Scotland for\n1984\n-\n85\n, then Lord of Appeal in Ordinary until\n1987\n. Margaret Thatcher, the Prime Minister, appointed Mackay as Lord Chancellor on\n27\nOctober\n1987\n. He held this position during the ten years in which the Conservative Party formed the government of Britain, making his tenure of the role of Lord Chancellor one of the longest in British history. As Lord Chancellor, Mackay was the Speaker of the House of Lords, the head of the judiciary, the custodian of the great seal, and the chief administrator of the legal system and courts. He was a cabinet minister with control of all judicial appointments except those reserved to the prime minister.\nIn\n1986\nLord Mackay became headline news in the British Press for very unfortunate reasons. In that year he attended the funeral of a senior Roman Catholic judge, and in\n1988\nhe again attended a funeral service in a Roman Catholic Church when another of his colleagues died. For this the Free Presbyterian Church stopped him being able to take communion. The Synod reviewed the action that the Church had taken against Mackay in\n1989\n, and upheld its punishment. Later, with great sadness, he left the Free Presbyterian Church.\nOn St Andrews day\n(30\nNovember\n)\n1991\n, Lord Mackay was installed as Chancellor of Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh. He served in this capacity for\n14\nyears and during that time conferred degrees on over\n30\n,\n000\nstudents:-\nHis last official act as Chancellor was to confer an honorary degree on his wife, Elizabeth, Lady Mackay, in recognition of her own important and valued contribution to the University during her husband's tenure as Chancellor.\nLord Mackay has received a great many honours in recognition of his outstanding achievements. The list is far too long to give in an article of this type so we mention only a few. He was elected a Fellow of the\nRoyal Society of Edinburgh\nin\n1984\nand received their Royal Medal in\n2003\n. He has received honorary degrees from the universities of Edinburgh\n(1983)\n, Dundee\n(1983)\n, Strathclyde\n(1985)\n, Aberdeen\n(1987)\n, St Andrews\n(1989)\n, Cambridge\n(1989)\n, William and Mary\n(1989)\n, Birmingham\n(1990)\n, Newcastle\n(1990)\n, Bath\n(1994)\n, Glasgow\n(1994)\n, Oxford\n(1998)\n, and De Montford\n(1999)\n. He was also elected an honorary Fellow of Trinity College Cambridge in\n1989\nand of Girton College Cambridge in\n1990\n. On\n8\nJuly\n1999\n. The Queen attended the installation of Lord Mackay of Clashfern as Knight of the Order of the Thistle in a ceremony at St Giles Cathedral in Edinburgh. The Queen approved that the Right Honourable the Lord Mackay of Clashfern KT be appointed Lord High Commissioner to the\n2005\nGeneral Assembly of the Church of Scotland, and he was reappointed by the Queen to the\n2006\nGeneral Assembly of the Church of Scotland.\nLord Mackay has walking and travel as his recreations but, in keeping with his religious upbringing, never works or travels far on Sunday. This, he says:-\n... serves as a good antidote to getting too high an opinion of yourself.",
