  "biografia": "Stefan Bergman\nwas born into a Jewish family in Czestochowa which, at the time of his birth, was in the Russian Empire. At the end of the nineteenth century, about a quarter of the population of Czestochowa were Jewish. The city is probably best known for the famous painting of 'Our Lady of Czestochowa' in the Jasna Gora monastery which attracts many Roman Catholic pilgrims. Stefan's parents were Bronislaw Bergman and Tekla Herc. Bronislaw was born in\n1861\nin Boczkowice, a town about\n60\nkm east of Czestochowa. His father, Stefan's paternal grandfather, was Shimeon Bergman, who was a Hebraic writer working for the journal\nYudshenko\n. Bronislaw became the manager of his brother's bank in Czestochowa in\n1890\n, later becoming a partner in the business. Tekla Herc was born in ÅÃ³dÅº. Her father had graduated from the rabbinical school in Warsaw and, at the time of her birth, was a community worker in ÅÃ³dÅº. Bronislaw and Tekla Bergman had three children, having two daughters Anka and Marta in addition to their son Stefan who is the subject of this biography. Both Anka and Marta died during the Nazi occupation of Poland during World War II.\nStefan was brought up in Czestochowa where he attended primary school and then the\ngymnazie\n(\nthe local\nGymnasium\n)\n. He completed his studies at the Gymnasium in\n1913\nand began his university studies in the School of Engineering at the University of Breslau. Following the usual practice of students at this time of studying at more than one institution, he moved to the School of Engineering at the University of Vienna in\n1915\nand remained there to complete his Diplomingenieur\n(\nEngineering degree\n)\nin\n1920\n. He decided to continue his studies and, having been very enthusiastic about both pure and applied mathematics while taking his engineering degree, entered the Institute for Applied Mathematics at the Berlin University in\n1921\n. This Institute had only been founded in\n1920\nwith\nRichard von Mises\nas its director.\nVon Mises\nstrongly influenced Bergman and this influence had a continuing impact on his scientific work for the rest of his career. Another of his professors at Berlin also had a major impact on his scientific development. This was\nErhard Schmidt\nwho had been awarded his doctorate by the University of GÃ¶ttingen for a thesis on\nintegral equations\nwritten under\nHilbert\n's supervision.\nBergman worked for his doctorate under\nvon Mises\n' supervision, and was awarded the degree in\n1922\nfor his thesis\nÃber die Entwicklung der harmonischen Funktionen der Ebene und des Raumes nach Orthogonalfunktionen\nâ\n(\nOn the development of harmonic functions of the plane and of space by orthogonal functions\n)\n. The authors of\n[\n6\n]\nwrite:-\nHis thesis dealt with the development of all analytic functions in a given domain in terms of a fixed set of orthogonal functions. Its results were applied, on the one hand, to fluid dynamics,\nconformal mapping\nand\npotential theory\nand led, on the other hand, to the \"Bergman kernel function\" which is one of his major achievements in pure mathematics.\nSee Kracht and Kreyszig\n[\n3\n]\nfor further details on the context of Bergman's work on kernel functions and their later generalisations by Aronszajn and others.\nPerhaps it was Bergman's deep understanding of both pure and applied mathematics which let him develop powerful method in potential theory which he applied to electrical engineering, elasticity and fluid flow. Bergman used the theory of integral equations as developed by\nErhard Schmidt\nand\nDavid Hilbert\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nTo obtain a large number of harmonic functions in space, he applied and generalised the\nWhittaker\nmethod to create such functions by means of integrals over analytic functions. Using algebraic-logarithmic analytic functions as generators in the integral, he created harmonic functions that are multivalued in space and have closed branch lines. This led him further to a general theory of integral operators that map arbitrary analytic functions into solutions of various partial differential equations. he devoted many years of work to this topic, producing a monograph in\n1969\n.\nWhile Bergman was working in Berlin on his\nhabilitation\nhis father, after many years of bad eyesight, went completely blind in\n1923\nand died on\n29\nDecember\n1929\n. In\n1930\nBergman was appointed as a\nprivatdozent\nin both the Institute for Mathematics and the Institute for Applied Mathematics at the University of Berlin with an habilitation thesis on the behaviour of kernel functions on the boundary of their domains. It was highly unusual for anyone to obtain a post in both Institutes, but entirely appropriate in Bergman's case. However he was forced from his positions in Berlin in\n1933\nafter Hitler came to power. On\n7\nth\nApril\n1933\n, Hitler introduced a law for the \"Restoration of the civil service\". This meant that all non-Aryans and Jewish civil servants were dismissed from their positions with the exception of those who either had fought in the Great War or had been in office since August\n1914\n. To escape from the anti-Semitic Nazi regime, Bergman went to Russia in\n1934\nworking at Tomsk in Siberia until\n1936\n, then at Tbilisi in Georgia during\n1936\n-\n37\n[\n6\n]\n:-\nThe success of his stay in the Soviet Union is best shown by the fact that some of his students became leading mathematicians in their own right, such as Vekua, Fuchs, Kufarev, etc.\nFor the second time in four years, Bergman was forced to move because of political decisions. This time it was the purges by Stalin of foreign scientists which forced him to leave Russia in\n1937\n. He went to the Institut\nHenri PoincarÃ©\nin Paris where he wrote an important two-volume monograph on complex analysis.\nIn\n1939\nWorld War II broke out and the German armies invaded France. Bergman was forced to flee for the third time, going to the United States with\nvon Mises\nas his sponsor. He lectured first at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he gave a series of lectures on\nTheory of pseudo-conformal transformations and its connection with differential geometry\nduring\n1939\n-\n40\n. Then he taught at Yeshiva College in New York City, moving then to Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. While at Brown University he participated in the Summer School in\n1941\nAdvanced instruction and research in mechanics\nwhich resulted in the publications\nPartial Differential Equations\nand\nFluid dynamics\n. In the following summer there was another summer school on\nAdvanced instruction and research in mechanics\nwhich resulted in the text\nThe Hodograph Method in the Theory of Compressible Fluid\n(1942)\n. As part of the war effort he also worked for the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics producing several reports such as:\nGraphical and Analytical Methods for the Determination of a Flow of a Compressible Fluid Around an Obstacle\n(\nJuly\n1945)\n;\nOn Two-dimensional Flows of Compressible Fluids\n(\nAugust\n1945)\n; and\nOn Supersonic and Partially Supersonic Flows\n(\nDecember\n1946)\n.  In\n1945\nhe joined\nvon Mises\nin Harvard. In the previous year\nvon Mises\nwrote the following concerning Bergman's work\n[\n9\n]\n:-\nIt has been known for a century that the problem of finding the two-dimensional potential flow of an incompressible fluid can be solved by means of complex variables: To each analytic function of a complex variable corresponds a particular solution of the potential problem and vice versa. Several years ago Stefan Bergman discovered that essentially the same is true for a vast class of partial differential equations which includes the potential equation as the simplest case. Bergman gave explicit formulae which allow a solution of a given differential equation to derive from an arbitrarily chosen analytic function\n(\nin some instances from a pair of real functions\n)\nand proved that all solutions can be derived in this way. Now, two of Bergman's pupils,\nBers\nand\nGelbart\n, found that in a special case the analogy can be carried much farther. They consider a special type of differential equation, yet more general than the potential equation, and build up a system of solutions in close analogy to the procedure followed in the theory of analytic functions. Fortunately, this restricted type includes the problem of a two-dimensional flow of a compressible fluid which is today in the centre of interest in aviation. Though all solutions obtained by\nBers\nand\nGelbart\ncan be derived by Bergman's methods also, it must be expected that the new approach will prove very useful.\nIn\n1950\nBergman married Adele Adlersberg and in the same year began a collaboration with\nMenahem M Schiffer\n. His stay in Harvard lasted until\n1952\nwhen he moved to the Mathematics Department at Stanford University where he spent the rest of his career. He was most interested in research and seldom taught, in fact this made it difficult for him to get a post since he made it known that he required a non-teaching post.\nBergman is best known for his research in several complex variables, as well as the Bergman projection and, as was mentioned above, the Bergman kernel function which he invented in\n1922\nwhile at Berlin University. He is also known for applications of the kernel function to conformal mappings which he explains in his classic text\nThe Kernel Function and Conformal Mapping\n(1950)\n.\nDonald Spencer\nwrites:-\nThis book is a survey of methods and results centring around orthogonal analytic functions and associated kernel functions defined for multiply-connected domains of the complex plane. ... The book is written in an elementary style which avoids abstract concepts almost entirely, and much of it can be read by anyone having an elementary knowledge of complex variables.\nA revised edition of this book which was considerably enlarged and included many new results was published in\n1970\n. In\n1953\nBergman and\nSchiffer\npublished\nKernel functions and elliptic differential equations in mathematical physics\n. P R Garabedian writes:-\nIn this book the authors collect their researches of the last few years on elliptic partial differential equations. The first part of the book is devoted largely to background material on heat conduction, fluid dynamics, electrostatics, and elasticity, together with the more formal applications of variational formulas and the kernel function. The second part lays more stress on rigor, and treats fundamental solutions, reduction of boundary value problems to integral equations, orthonormal systems and kernel functions, eigenvalue problems associated with the kernels, variational theory of domain functions, comparison domains, basic existence theorems, and dependence of solutions on the boundary data or on the coefficients of the differential equation. The presentation is in an easy flowing style, and the material should prove to be a most useful guide to those interested in the more advanced theory of linear elliptic partial differential equations.\nBergman published\nIntegral operators in the theory of linear partial differential equations\nin\n1961\n. This book was reviewed by\nCopson\n(\nsee\n[\n2\n]\n)\nand White\n(\nsee\n[\n10\n]\n)\n. J Mitchell also reviews the book, writing:-\nThis treatise gives a summary of the author's numerous contributions from\n1926\nto\n1961\nto the theory of solutions of linear partial differential equations in two and three real variables by means of integral operators which usually involve analytic functions of one, or sometimes two, complex variables. Results in the theory of one complex variable on such topics as analytic continuation, the residue theorem,\nHadamard\n's theorems on the connection between the coefficients of the power series development of an analytic function and the character and location of the singularities and on Abelian integrals are used to give information concerning domains of regularity, series expansion, singularities and integral relations for the solutions.\nIn\n1974\nCharles Fefferman\nfound a deep application of Bergman's ideas to biholomorphic mappings and a conference on several complex variables, held in\n1975\n, had Bergman's work as its main theme. Bergman attended the conference, clearly enjoying the central role of his work.\nKrantz, writing about Bergman in\n[\n4\n]\n, explained:-\nBergman was an extraordinarily kind and gentle man. He went out of his way to help many young people begin their careers, and he made great efforts on behalf of Polish Jews during the Nazi terror. He is remembered fondly by all who knew him.\nBergman died in\n1977\n, and after his wife died the terms of her will ensured that funds should be used for a special prize to honour her husband's name:-\nThe\nAmerican Mathematical Society\nwas asked by the Wells Fargo Bank of California, the managers of the Bergman Trust, to assemble a committee to select recipients of the prize. In addition the Society assisted Wells Fargo in interpreting the terms of the will to assure sufficient breadth in the mathematical areas in which the prize may be given. Awards are made every year or two in:\n1)\nthe theory of the kernel function and its applications in real and complex analysis; or\n2)\nfunction-theoretic methods in the theory of partial differential equations of elliptic type with attention to Bergman's operator method.",
