  "biografia": "David Donoho\nwas the son of Paul Leighton Donoho\n(1931\n-\n2012)\nand Julia Arlene Haas\n(1931\n-\n2020)\n. Paul Donoho, the son of David Hubert Leigh Donoho and Aletria Martelle Hicks, grew up in Houston, Texas, where he attended Lamar High School. He studied at Rice Institute in Houston\n(\nwhich became Rice University in\n1960)\n, graduating in\n1952\nwith Honours in Physics. He then undertook research at the California Institute of Technology, marrying Julia Haas on\n14\nAugust\n1954\nin Los Angeles, California. He was still studying for his Ph.D. when his son David Leigh Donoho, was born in Los Angeles. Paul Donoho was awarded a Ph.D. in\n1958\nfor his thesis\nPhotoproduction of Positive K Mesons in Hydrogen\nhaving been examined by a committee that included\nRichard Feynman\n.\nAfter a short spell at Bell Labs in New Jersey, the family moved to Houston, Texas when Paul Donoho was appointed to Rice University. Two further children were added to the family: Andrew Ward Donoho\n(\nborn\n11\nAugust\n1960\nin Houston, Harris, Texas\n)\nand Julia Anne Donoho\n(\nborn\n13\nAugust\n1961\nin Houston, Harris, Texas\n)\n. Let us note at this point that Paul and Julia Donoho were divorced on\n9\nMay\n1979\nand Paul married Merrily Pilot in\n1982\n.\nAll of David Donoho's schooling was in Houston where his father was promoted steadily to become Professor of Physics at Rice University. David attended Robert E Lee High School in Houston, Texas, graduating\n1974\n. This school, founded in\n1960\n, has now been renamed as the Margaret Long Wisdom High School. Donoho writes\n[\n3\n]\n:-\nI remember the chalk dust, slate blackboards and marble hallways of\n[\nmy father's\n]\nacademic office, and the lasers and low-temperature gadgets in his laboratory. Paul took our family on sabbatical to Grenoble, France, where I attended\n6\nth grade - a transforming educational experience.\nDavid was about eleven years old when the family went to France. Although he only spent one year at school in Grenoble, finding France had a very intense mathematical culture had a very large impact on his attitude towards mathematics. He said in the interview\n[\n36\n]\n:-\nAlso, seeing another culture and learning another language was very important.\nFor his university studies, Donoho's mother wanted him to go to Princeton, believing that it was the best university, and his father told him that he should definitely learn about computers because then he would always have a summer job in college because expertise in computers was good for finding employment. He followed his parents advice and when he got to Princeton he looked for a job in computer programming that would give him money to pay for his meals. He was given a job in the Statistics Department. His first task was to analyse data about people's use of energy in their homes. A massive data set was being collected and Donoho was hired as part of the data gathering. Later he became a manager of one of the first UNIX systems outside AT&T Bell Laboratories.\nJohn Tukey\n, the first Head of the Department of Statistics which was set up at Princeton inÂ\n1965\n, was also involved in the development of electronic computers at Bell Labs. Donoho was able to learn UNIX years before it became widely used. He wrote in\n[\n28\n]\n:-\nI used three \"statistics packages\" while a Princeton undergraduate. P-STAT was an SPSS-like mainframe package which I used on Princeton's IBM\n360\n/\n91\nMainframe; ISP was a UNIX minicomputer package on which I worked as a co-developer for the Princeton Statistics Department; and my teacher Don McNeil had developed software for a book of his own on exploratory data analysis; this ultimately became SPIDA after he moved to Macquarie University.\nIn fact while an undergraduate he wrote\nDocumentation for ISP\n(\nInteractive Statistical Processor\n)\n(1977)\nfor the Department of Statistics at Princeton University. In the summer of\n1977\nhe worked as a programmer for University of Texas Marine Science Institute. The work he undertook involved programming a minicomputer for real-time detection and location of seismic events using data from seismic arrays in Costa Rica. He graduated from Princeton University with an A.B. in Statistics in\n1978\nhaving written an undergraduate thesis with John Tukey as his advisor.\nAfter graduating from Princeton, Donoho was employed in the oil exploration business in Houston, Texas, as a Research Geophysicist at the Western Geophysical Company. The Company had just gone digital and with massive amounts of seismic data they needed algorithms to handle the large data sets. He implemented robust regression to work with data in thousands of rows and columns. During this time he lived at home and signed his pay cheque over to his father every month to pay him back for the college tuition fees he had paid. During the time he worked for the Western Geophysical Company he was sent to London, England, for several months so he could work with the Saudi Arabian oil company Aramco. It was an interesting time showing Aramco the robust methods he had developed, but he also found time to enjoy visits to many art museums and plays in London.\nIn\n1979\nDonoho enrolled at Harvard University to study for a Ph.D. His thesis advisor at Harvard was Peter Jost Huber, a Swiss mathematician who had started his career as a topologist with\nBeno Eckmann\nand\nHeinz Hopf\nas his thesis advisors, but had changed to statistics. Huber, one of the three main founders of robust statistics, had been appointed as Professor of Statistics at Harvard in\n1978\n. He wrote the first systematic, book-length, description of robust statistics with his book\nRobust Statistics\nwhich he had in draft form in\n1972\nand was completed in\n1980\n. Donoho talked about Huber in\n[\n36\n]\n:-\nHe was a very stimulating and interesting man and you could have many interesting conversations with him over tea. He was very interested in computers at the time and decided that the ideas of\nJohn Tukey\n, who had been my undergraduate advisor, were really the right ones, that you should be visualising data, using computer graphics. Peter was very interested in getting modern computer graphics to visualise data. I worked with my other co-students on various computer graphics. At the same time I couldn't stay away from ideas I had learnt about in my industrial research.\nDonoho wrote the\n70\n-page Ph.D. Qualifying Paper\nBreakdown properties of multivariate location estimators\nwhich was accepted in April\n1982\n. The paper\n[\n19\n]\n:-\n... exhibits coordinate-free estimators of multivariate location which can withstand up to\n50\n% contamination of the data before breaking down. These include affine- equivariant generalisations of trimmed means and W-estimates, and a new minimum-distance estimator.\nHe was awarded a Ph.D. in\n1983\nfor his\n418\n-page thesis\nDART: A Tool for Research in Data Analysis\n. In it he\n[\n19\n]\n:-\n... describes the design and implementation of a compact data analysis language. The uses of the language for constructing advanced systems for multivariate graphics are described.\nWhile at Harvard, Donoho had met Miriam Gasko\n(\nborn\n22\nMay\n1945)\nwho was also undertaking research at Harvard for a Ph.D. in statistics. She was awarded a Ph.D. in\n1981\nfor her thesis\nTesting Sequentially Selected Outliers from Linear Models\n. She published papers with Arthur Pentland Dempster, who worked at the Department of Statistics at Harvard from its founding in\n1957\n, such as\nNew Tools for Residual Analysis\n(1981)\n. Donoho and Gasko published the joint paper\nInfluential observations in data analysis\n(1982)\nby which time Gasko was at the University of Chicago.\nAfter the award of his doctorate in\n1983\n, Donoho was appointed as NSF Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Statistics at the University of California, Berkeley. He held this postdoctoral fellowship for the two years\n1983\n-\n85\n, but in\n1984\nhe was appointed as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Statistics at Berkeley. Also in\n1984\nDonoho and Gasko were married. They had a son Daniel Aharon Donoho, born in\n1985\n, who was awarded a B.A. from Dartmouth College\n(2006)\nand a medical degree from the State University of New York at Stony Brook\n(2013)\n. He became a neurosurgeon who develops machine learning systems to make surgery safer.\nIn\n1985\nDavid Donoho was awarded the Presidential Young Investigator Award by the National Science Foundation. This prestigious award gave him funds to support his research for five years. He used funding from the award to run a conference for research statisticians from Eastern Europe, Germany and France. For information about this award and other awards made to Donoho see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nAlso in\n1985\n, Donoho, together with his brother Andrew Donoho and his wife Miriam Gasko. published\nMacSpin: Graphical Data Analysis\ncomprising of a book and a computer graphics system. The MacSpin system was produced by D\n2\n, a company founded by Donoho to produce the software. MacSpin received the award \"MacSpin - Best Scientific/Engineering Software of\n1987\n,\" from the\nMacUser Magazine\n. You can read a version of the\nMacUser\nreview\n[\n49\n]\nof the first version of MacSpin at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nDonoho was promoted rapidly at the University of California, Berkeley: Assistant Professor of Statistics\n(1984\n-\n86)\n; Associate Professor of Statistics\n(1987\n-\n1990)\n; and Professor of Statistics\n(1990\n-\n1997)\n. He wrote about his research during these years in\n[\n3\n]\n:-\nAt Berkeley during my postdoctoral and junior faculty years\n(1985\n-\n1990)\n, I was in the Mecca of classical mathematical statistics, but I pursued my 'non-classical' interests. Iain Johnstone and I showed how to optimally 'denoise' sparse signals observed in noise, injecting 'sparsity' into top statistics journals. A sparse signal sticks up here and there above the noise, like daisies above weeds; our denoiser, based on\nl\n1\nl_{1}\nl\n1\nâ\n-minimization, chops away the weeds while leaving the daisies. Jeff Hoch and Alan Stern successfully applied such ideas in Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy. To publish 'non-classical' work on undersampled measurements of sparse signals, I turned to applied mathematics journals.\nIn\n1991\nhe was appointed as Professor in the Department of Statistics of Stanford University. He was officially named to the Anne T and Robert M Bass Professorship in the School of Humanities and Sciences of Stanford University in a ceremony in the Iris & B Gerald Cantor Center for Visual Arts on Wednesday\n29\nMay\n2002\nattended by friends, family, and colleagues. In addition to these appointments, Donoho has been a Visiting Professor at CNRS, UniversitÃ© de Paris XI, in the summer of\n1986\n, at the UniversitÃ© de Paris VII in\n1992\n, and at the UniversitÃ© de Paris XI in\n1998\n. He was a Sackler Fellow at Tel Aviv University in\n2000\n,\nKloosterman\nProfessor at the University of Leiden in\n2002\n, and Rothschild Visiting Professor and Rothschild Lecturer at the University of Cambridge in\n2008\n.\nDonoho's work has covered a very broad spectrum and has had applications in many important areas. We give the following short summary from\n[\n27\n]\n:-\nDavid Donoho has studied the exploitation of sparse signals in signal recovery, including for denoising, superresolution, and solution of underdetermined equations. He coined the notion of compressed sensing which has impacted many scientific and technical fields, including magnetic resonance imaging in medicine, where it has been implemented in FDA-approved medical imaging protocols and is already used in millions of actual patient MRIs. In recent years he has been studying large-scale covariance matrix estimation, large-scale matrix denoising, detection of rare and weak signals among many pure noise non-signals, compressed sensing and related scientific imaging problems, and most recently, empirical deep learning.\nFor details of his work over the last\n20\nyears, see the abstracts of ten lectures he has given at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nThere are other aspects of Donoho's career that we should mention. We have seen a list of over\n25\npatents issued by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, U.S. which involve Donoho. They all list other colleagues, for example David Salim Hindawi\n(\nborn December\n1944)\nwho was president of BigFix Inc. and Lisa Ellen Lippincott who was awarded a Ph.D. by the University of California Berkeley in\n1994\nfor her thesis\nA Complete System of Proof for Diagrammatic Languages\n. The company BigFix Inc. was founded in April\n1997\nin Emeryville, California by David Hindawi and David Donoho\n[\n54\n]\n:-\nThe company's initial product was a user self-service system management application that was marketed to Original Equipment Manufacturer PC manufacturers. In\n2002\n, the company developed BigFix software for company-wide networked desktop, mobile and server computer management. This shifted the focus of the company from consumer to enterprise markets. Initial uses centred on security patch management, which was identified as a significant pain point at that time for enterprise IT departments. In\n2007\n, BigFix expanded to specific management areas: security threat suppression\n(\nBigFix Endpoint Protection\n)\n, enterprise security configuration management\n(\nBigFix Security Configuration and Vulnerability Management\n)\nand enterprise systems management\n(\nBigFix Systems Lifecycle Management\n)\n.\nDonoho writes in\n[\n19\n]\nthat he was:-\n... co-founder of BigFix.com, a Berkeley, CA start-up aiming to fundamentally change the practice of technical support for computers and associated network-connected devices. As disclosed in several US Patents, BigFix has developed a new internet communications model with profound implications for the high tech sector, implications reaching far beyond the initial applications in technical support.\nThe company BigFix Inc. was acquired by IBM in\n2010\nfor about $\n400\n,\n000\n,\n000\n.\nFor his remarkable work Donoho has been awarded many prizes and honours. He has been awarded the Presidential Young Investigator Award\n1985\n, made a MacArthur Fellow\n1991\n, given the Committee of Presidents of Statistical Societies Presidents' Award\n1994\n, the SIAM\nJohn von Neumann\nLecture Prize\n2001\n, and the Information Theory Society Paper Award\n2008\n. This was awarded for his paper\nCompressed Sensing\n(2006)\nwhich\n[\n3\n]\n:-\n... explained that, because the wavelet transform sparsifies images, images can be recovered from relatively few random measurements via\nl\n1\nl_{1}\nl\n1\nâ\nminimization.\nHe received the\nNorbert Wiener\nPrize in Applied Mathematics\n2010\n[\n51\n]\n:-\n... for introducing novel fundamental and powerful mathematical tools in signal processing and image analysis. His many outstanding contributions include those to compressed sensing and the construction of multiscale analysis techniques that take advantage of the specific mathematical and physical properties of the problems under consideration. His methods are very deep mathematically and very efficient computationally. This explains their success with both theoreticians and practitioners, which causes him to be one of the most cited applied and computational mathematicians of our time.\nDonoho was awarded the Shaw Prize in\n2013\n[\n23\n]\n:-\n... for his profound contributions to modern mathematical statistics and in particular the development of optimal algorithms for statistical estimation in the presence of noise and of efficient techniques for sparse representation and recovery in large data-sets.\nThe\nGauss\nPrize for\n2018\nwas awarded to David Donoho\n[\n45\n]\n:-\n... for his fundamental contributions to the mathematical, statistical and computational analysis of signal processing.\nDavid Donoho was awarded the Jack S Kilby Signal Processing Medal by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers in\n2022\n[\n1\n]\n:-\n... for groundbreaking contributions to sparse signal recovery and compressed sensing.\nFor more information about all these awards and prizes given to Donoho, see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nSome other awards include the following. In\n2008\nhe was awarded the Information Theory Paper Award from the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. The purpose of the Information Theory Paper Award is to recognise exceptional publications in the field and to stimulate interest in and encourage contributions to fields of interest of the Society. On\n7\nJune\n2011\nthe publisher Elsevier announced the winners of the Executable Paper Grand Challenge\n[\n34\n]\n:-\nMatan Gavish and David Donoho, Stanford University, received third prize for \"A Universal Identifier for Computational Results\". The Universal Identifier is a specific implementation of one aspect the executable paper - an ID resolution system for results. The proposed solution is simple and elegant, and confers ease of use by adding one or two lines of code.\nOther honours given to Donoho include: election to the\nAmerican Academy of Arts and Sciences\n(1992)\n; election to the\nNational Academy of Sciences\n, USA\n(1998)\n; election as Foreign Associate of the AcadÃ©mie des Sciences\n(2010)\n; and election to the American Philosophical Society\n(2019)\n. He was awarded an honorary Doctor of Science from the University of Chicago\n(2009)\n, a Doctor Honoris Causa from the Ãcole Polytechnique FÃ©dÃ©rale de Lausanne\n(2012)\n, an honorary Doctor of Science from the University of Waterloo\n(2016)\n, and an honorary Doctor of Science from Technion\n(2017)\n. The first of these honorary degrees was from the University of Chicago\n[\n17\n]\n:-\nOn\n9\nOctober David L Donoho received the honorary degree of Doctor of Science from The University of Chicago. The occasion was a special convocation, the\n500\nth in the university's history, and Donoho's was one of four degrees awarded. In presenting the degree, the university's president - mathematician Robert Zimmer - said, \"David L Donoho is a mathematical statistician and also one of the more influential applied mathematicians of his generation. Building upon the discipline of statistics, Donoho has developed effective new approaches to constructing low-dimensional representations for modern high-dimensional data problems. His work provides new insight into some of the most pressing scientific questions of the present day.\"\nPerhaps the most impressive of all is that Donoho was named as the most cited mathematician in the decade of the\n1990\ns. He was named most highly-cited author in the field of Mathematics in the decade of the\n1990\nby Institute for Scientific Information, makers of the Science Citation Index and associated citation services. The Institute for Scientific Information methodology counted citations in all fields of science and engineering to the\n200\nmost-cited papers in mathematics in each year\n1990\n-\n1999\n. Donoho was the author of ten such highly-cited papers, also the most among mathematicians.\nDonoho commented in\n2018\n[\n14\n]\n:-\nThere are things I've done decades ago, and when I see things happen in the real world, it makes me so proud. The power we have in moving the world gives me a great deal of satisfaction in my career choice. ... There are so many relations between mathematics and the rest of the world. We see more and more relations over time; so much in the modern world is underpinned by mathematics, for example smartphones, and the vast level of mathematical fundamentals intertwined, such as prime factorisation.\nLet us end with some comments taken from the talk by his colleague Emmanuel CandÃ¨s's\n(\nwith some reformatting\n)\n[\n4\n]\n:-\nDavid Donoho is a modern polymath who informs himself about everything: science, engineering, policy making ..., tries to understand what people are doing successfully, and develops insightful mathematics - to understand why things work/don't work - to create new models for data - to create new processing algorithms - and to ultimately inspire real concrete improvements; e.g. in human health.\nDavid Donoho is a 'physicist of information' who is a deep mathematical thinker who tirelessly informs himself about what others are doing successfully. This requires extra effort, it is not easy. He sets the course/agenda and is in the lineage of intellectual giants like\nEuler\n,\nGauss\n,\nPoincarÃ©\n,\nWiener\n,\nKolmogorov\n, and\nvon Neumann\n.",
