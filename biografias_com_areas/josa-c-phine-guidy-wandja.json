  "biografia": "JosÃ©phine Guidy-Wandja\nwas given the name JosÃ©phine Wandja; she adopted the name Guidy-Wandja, by which she is now known, after her marriage. She spent the first fourteen years of her life in Cameroon before the family moved to France where she attended the LycÃ©e de Jeunes Filles at ChÃ¢tellerault, a town between Tours and Poitiers. ChÃ¢tellerault is about\n300\nkm south west of Paris. After a year studying at this school, in\n1960\nshe obtained the BEPC, the Brevet d'Ã©tudes de Premier Cycle, a qualification given after students had been examined in mathematics, French and history/geography.\nAfter studying in ChÃ¢tellerault, Wandja moved to Paris where she attended the LycÃ©e Fenelon and the LycÃ©e Jules Ferry. The LycÃ©e Fenelon was the first girls' high school in Paris founded in the Latin Quarter in\n1892\nand prepared girls to enter the Ãcole Normale SupÃ©rieure in Fontenay-aux-Roses. This university for girls is on the south west side of Paris about\n8\nkm from the centre of the city. The LycÃ©e Jules Ferry was founded in\n1913\nas a girls' school but admitted boys in\n1960\njust before Wandja began studying there. She attended courses for the first and second parts of the Baccalaureate at the LycÃ©e Jules Ferry where she also prepared for entering the Grandes Ãcoles. She also studied at the UniversitÃ© Pierre et Marie-Curie for the MGP, General Mathematics and Physics. Already Wandja was set on studying mathematics at university and she explained how she came to that decision in the interview\n[\n6\n]\n:-\nI cannot say that I was born to be a mathematician. I followed a path that led me to mathematics. As I went through the steps, I thought why not continue. Also, I must admit that my father was very demanding and followed me closely. I had faith in what I was doing. But there is no talent without work. Until the end, I did not know what I wanted to be. My parents wanted me to opt for medicine. That subject is above my human capacity. I am very emotional. I worked as a team with my girl friends and we said to ourselves: \"why not do the maths\" and we registered in the preparatory class for \"Fontenay-aux-Roses\".\nBetween June\n1965\nand October\n1969\nWandja obtained twelve certificates for higher studies in subjects such as general mathematics and mathematical physics, general mechanics, integral calculus, number theory, etc. She met her future husband in\n1968\nat a student dance when she was a mathematics student at the University of Paris\n6\nand he was an engineering student. At that time she was being advised by\nRenÃ© Thom\n,\nHenri Cartan\nand Paulette Liberman. She was awarded her Doctorat\n3\nÃ¨me cycle by the University of Paris\n6\nin\n1971\nfor her thesis\nSous les courbes fermÃ©es convexes du plan et le thÃ©orÃ¨me des quatre sommets\nâ\n(\nOn convex closed curves of the plane and the four vertex theorem\n)\n. Speaking of her husband's support for her studies, she said\n[\n6\n]\n:-\nThanks to his encouragement, three years after meeting him, I obtained my doctoral degree and we got married.\nShe spoke of married life in the following way\n[\n6\n]\n:-\nWith respect for commitments, organization, and love, the big African family can make you lift mountains and allow you to live your life as a wife and mother. Because on this side, since mathematics is brain-based - if the brain has problems, mathematically, it cannot go far - a mother's attention and brain are occupied by her child during at least nine months of pregnancy, and nine months of breastfeeding, i.e. eighteen months per child, so for five children that is about eight years. Eight years when the laboratory of the mind is idling. If this laboratory is slowed for eight years, when it reopens, is it at the same level as one that worked full time, that of the man? Then draw your own conclusions.\nWandja started teaching at the Jacques Amyot High School in Melun\n(\nnear Paris\n)\nduring the\n1969\n-\n70\nacademic year, after which she went to the University of Paris VII where she became assistant professor before joining the University of Abidjan in October\n1971\nwhere she was appointed as a lecturer. In\n1979\nthe Centre de recherche de mathÃ©matiques de la dÃ©cision of the UniversitÃ© Paris IX-Dauphine published Guidy-Wandja's work Â\nInvestissement et Ã©pargne: un modÃ¨le quadratique d'allocation\nâ\n(\nInvestment and savings: a quadratic allocation model\n)\n.\nIn\n1981\n, after being advised by Jean-Pierre Aubin, Guidy-Wandja was awarded a 'Doctorat d'Ã©tat en sciences mathÃ©matiques' by the UniversitÃ© Nationale de Cote d'Ivoire, Abidjan, CÃ´te d'Ivoire, for her thesis\nModÃ¨les de dÃ©cision entre investissement en biens durables et Ã©pargne en biens fiduciaires et ModÃ¨le de partage Ã©quitable ou thÃ©orie du chÃ´mage\nâ\n(\nDecision models between investment in durable goods and savings in fiduciary property and fair share model or unemployment theory\n)\n. We note that some sources give the title of this thesis as\nEconomie quadratique\nâ\n(\nQuadratic economy\n)\nand the year of award as\n1980\n. In fact Jean-Pierre Aubin gives this on his own website but the full title of the thesis, as held by the UniversitÃ© Nationale de Cote d'Ivoire, has the longer title we have quoted.\nA somewhat puzzling event took place in\n1983\nwhich is described in\n[\n1\n]\n. Primarily on the initiative of Guidy-Wandja, the International Committee on Mathematics in Developing Countries was set up and held its constitutive meeting in Warsaw when the International Congress of Mathematicians was taking place there in August\n1983\n. At this meeting Guidy-Wandja was elected as President of the International Committee on Mathematics in Developing Countries. By setting this up during the Warsaw Congress, it looked as if the International Committee on Mathematics in Developing Countries was associated with the\nInternational Mathematical Union\nbut in fact the\nInternational Mathematical Union\nhad its own committee, the Committee on Development and Exchange with almost exactly the same aims and objectives as the new International Committee. The Chairman of the Committee on Development and Exchange wrote to Guidy-Wandja making clear that the Committee on Development and Exchange was the only body within the\nInternational Mathematical Union\nwith a remit for developing countries. He asked why Guidy-Wandja felt it necessary to set up a new organisation. The International Committee on Mathematics in Developing Countries quickly decided to organise the international symposium \"Informatics and the Teaching of Mathematics in Developing Countries\" planned to be held in Yamoussoukro, Cote d'Ivoire, in August\n1985\n. Much confusion followed and eventually the symposium was cancelled two weeks before it was due to begin. The International Committee on Mathematics in Developing Countries failed to gain international support and soon ceased to exist.\nIn\n1985\n, in collaboration with Jess Sah Bi, Guidy-Wandja published the children's mathematics comic book\nYao crack en maths\n.\n\"Yao crack\" is a comic strip made up of about twenty titled sketches, such as \"Yao and Thales\", \"mathematical speaking\" etc. Thanks to the drawings of our talented cartoonist Jess Sah Bi the scenes are full of humour and portray some of the difficulties that the African child faces in mathematics. As soon as a mathematics teacher says to a child\n(\npupil or student\n)\n\"go to the board\", he sweats like Yao on the cover. We want to demystify mathematics to make it accessible to as many children as possible. ... Mathematics is at the base of all science and technology, both as a way of thinking and as an instrument of inquiry.\nIn\n1992\nGuidy-Wandja was awarded a Doctorat d'Ãtat en Science Ãconomie for her thesis\nLa dynamique d'intÃ©gration commerciale des pays de l'Afrique subsaharienne: cas de la Zone Franc\nâ\n(\nThe trade integration dynamics of the countries of sub-Saharan Africa: the case of the Francophone Zone\n)\n. In\n1993\nshe published\nPeut-on dÃ©valuer le franc CFA?\nâ\n(\nCan we devalue the CFA franc?\n)\n(\nsee\n[\n3\n]\n)\n. The letters CFA have been given different meanings over time, from 'French Colonies of Africa', to 'French Community of Africa', but by the time Guidy-Wandja wrote this article it stood for 'African Financial Community'. It was a currency used by thirteen African countries and tied in value, at this time, to the French franc. The Abstract of this article is as follows\n[\n3\n]\n:-\nAfter recalling the history of the CFA franc, which exists only in relation to the French franc to which it has been tied by a fixed parity since\n1948\n, the author discusses the possibility and the consequences of a devaluation of the CFA. The fixing of parity is one of the principles underlying the strength and credibility of the CFA franc. According to the monetary agreements, the parity of the CFA can only be modified if all the Member States agree. Unanimity never seems to have existed before for a change of parity. Assuming it is done tomorrow, the effects on African economies are likely to be catastrophic. Moreover, it is not certain that this devaluation resolves the fundamental problem which remains that of the relationship between the prices of exported products and import prices, that is to say the terms of trade whose variations reflect the enrichment or impoverishment of a country according to the evolution of world prices. Since\n1970\n, most of the thirteen countries in the CFA zone have seen their terms of trade deteriorate from year to year.\nIn fact on\n12\nJanuary\n1994\nthe CFA franc was devalued with the aim of helping African exports.\nA publication by Guidy-Wandja,\nExcision? Mutilation sexuelle? Mythe ou RÃ©alitÃ©?\nâ\n(\nExcision? Sexual mutilation? Myth or reality?\n)\n(1987)\n(\nsee\n[\n4\n]\n)\nhas been much quoted and discussed, but it is not the place here to look at this article.\nAsked about the contribution of women in African society, Guidy-Wandja replied\n[\n6\n]\n:-\nThe woman has always brought a lot of tradition and maternity. She is a wife, mother, educator, economic and social development officer. She has a very important part to play in development. As for her emancipation and evolution, she can only follow the emancipation and evolution of our states.\nShe gives a final word of praise for the magazine\nAmina\nthat is carrying out the interview\n[\n6\n]\n:-\nI hope that in Africa many women are devoted to science\n(\nlaw, physics, chemistry, etc.\n)\n. If a woman wants, she can do more. I especially congratulate \"Amina\" for the progress made since its creation. It is a privileged instrument for the emancipation of the black woman. Continue to allow women from all walks of life to express themselves. Congratulations and thank you to Amina! All women must support you!\nGuidy-Wandja has received many honours including the Ordre de MÃ©rite de l'Education Nationale\n(\nCÃ´te-d'Ivoire\n)\nand Officier des Palmes AcadÃ©miques\n(\nFrance\n)\n.",
