  "biografia": "Samuel Haughton\n's parents were Samuel Haughton Sr.\n(1787\n-\n1877)\nand Sarah Hancock\n(1787\n-\n1861)\n. We note that several biographies give the father of the subject of this biography as the social reformer James Haughton\n(1795\n-\n1873)\nbut this is incorrect. Samuel Haughton Sr. was a merchant living at Burrin House, County Carlow. He seems to have dealt with several different types of merchandise. For example, in the Carlow Directory of\n1824\n[\n3\n]\n, Samuel Haughton of Burrin Street is listed as a linen and woollen draper while in the Carlow Directory of\n1839\n[\n19\n]\nhe is listed as a merchant of corn, butter, timber, and slate. Sarah Hancock was the daughter of John Hancock, a linen merchant from Lisburn. Samuel and Sarah, both Quakers, were married on\n10\nApril\n1817\nin Carlow. They had seven children: John Hancock, Dora, Fanny, Samuel\n(\nthe subject of this biography\n)\n, Louisa, Elizabeth-Anne, and Harriet. The town of Carlow in\n1824\n(\nwhen the subject of this biography was two years old\n)\nis described in\n[\n3\n]\nas follows:-\nAnciently called Catherlough, or \"the city on the lake\",\n[\nCarlow\n]\nis agreeably situated on the river Barrow. It is the assize town of the county, and distant forty miles south by west of Dublin, twenty-four south of Naas, and eighteen miles north by east of Kilkenny. It consists of two main streets intersecting each other at right angles, and of others of minor importance, branching from the former; besides these there are extensive suburbs on each side the river.\nSamuel Haughton was brought up in Carlow where he attended the Carlow Diocesan School in Church Lane. At school, he was friendly with his cousin Wilfred Haughton\n(1822\n-\n1899)\n, a son of Thomas Haughton who was also a Carlow merchant, and the two boys worked together to build a steam engine. They declared that it worked to their satisfaction. Haughton, however, had a wide range of interests and was taught Hebrew, botany, chemistry and astronomy by the Rev John Emerson of Mayo. Emerson also taught him about the geology of the Leinster coalfield, thus giving Haughton an interest in a topic that he would study for most of his life. The young boy thought at this stage that he might aim for a clerical career, in particular to devote himself to missionary work. As a consequence, he worked at the local hospital where he was taught by Dr Thomas Rawson. As a Quaker, Haughton would not have been eligible to study at Trinity College, Dublin. At this time Trinity College, Dublin, restricted its degrees, fellowships, and scholarships to Anglicans so Haughton converted to become an Anglican.\nHaughton entered Trinity College, Dublin, in\n1838\nwhere he studied mathematics and science. At this time there were some outstanding mathematicians at Trinity College Dublin including\nWilliam Rowan Hamilton\n,\nJames MacCullagh\n,\nCharles Graves\nand\nHumphrey Lloyd\n.\nGeorge Salmon\n, who graduated from Trinity College, Dublin, in\n1838\n, became a lecturer there in\n1841\n. Haughton excelled as an undergraduate as Cunningham explains in\n[\n4\n]\n:-\n[\nHaughton\n]\npossessed in a remarkable degree the qualities which lead to success in College life, quickness of apprehension, a clear head, and a tenacious and ready memory.\nIn\n1842\nhe was awarded the Lloyd Exhibition in mathematics and he graduated in the following year ranked first among the mathematics graduates. He was advised by\nGeorge Salmon\nto enter the competition for a fellowship\n[\n7\n]\n:-\n... the examination for fellowship was formidable, being held on twelve days preceding Trinity Sunday from nine to twelve in the forenoon and two to five in the afternoon of each day. The subjects of the examination were pure and applied mathematics, experimental physics, mental and moral philosophy, Greek language and literature, Latin language and literature, and Hebrew and cognate languages.\nHe was awarded a fellowship in the\n1844\nexamination, becoming the youngest person to achieve this distinction. In order to take up a Fellowship at Trinity College Dublin one was required to take holy orders in the Church of Ireland, which indeed he did, being ordained deacon in\n1846\nand priest in\n1847\n. Joseph Galbraith was four years older that Haughton and graduated in\n1839\n, four years before Haughton, but he also was awarded a fellowship in the\n1844\nexamination. He was talented in applying mathematics to a wide range of different topics and the two young men were close friends and became collaborators\n[\n5\n]\n:-\nShortly after graduating, Galbraith, Haughton and two other Junior Fellows began a course of lectures to prepare young men for the entrance examinations to the artillery and engineers branches of the military academy in Woolwich, and the Indian civil service. Their students were highly successful at obtaining these positions, but in\n1851\nthe classes were discontinued at the request of the Board of Trinity College, and the two men directed their energies on the preparation of scientific manuals.\nBefore describing these manuals, we note that Haughton married his half-cousin Louisa Haughton\n(1828\n-\n1888)\nin\n1848\n; they were half-cousins since their fathers were half-brothers. Samuel and Louisa Haughton had four sons: Samuel\n(\nborn\n1849)\n, John\n(\nborn\n1851)\n, Thomas\n(\nborn\n1853)\nand William Steele\n(\nborn\n1869)\nand two daughters, Louisa and one who died in infancy.\nReturning to the Galbraith-Haughton manuals we list them together with the date of publication by\nLongmans\nof their first edition:\nMechanics\n(1854)\n,\nOptics\n(1854)\n,\nHydrostatics\n(1854)\n,\nTrigonometry\n(1852)\n,\nArithmetic\n(1854)\n,\nAstronomy\n(1856)\n,\nEuclid I-III\n(1854)\n,\nEuclid IV-VI\n(1859)\n,\nAlgebra\n(1860)\n,\nMathematical Tables\n(1860)\n,\nSteam Engine\n(1864)\n, and\nTides & Currents\n(1862)\n. We note that these were very popular; they sold well and some ran to as many as\n14\nor\n15\neditions.\nAfter his success in the fellowship examination, Haughton undertook research in applied mathematics. As an undergraduate he had been taught by\nJames MacCullagh\nand, after taking up the fellowship, he shared a room with\nMacCullagh\nwho informally took on the role of Haughton's research advisor. His research involved applying mathematics to various areas of physics and chemistry. This work was highly successful and, in\n1848\n, Haughton was awarded the Cunningham medal by the\nRoyal Irish Academy\nfor his paper\nOn the laws of equilibrium and motion of solid and fluid bodies\n(1846)\nwhich he published in the\nCambridge and Dublin Mathematical Journal\n. However, this outstanding work by Haughton came to an abrupt end when\nMacCullagh\ncommitted suicide in October\n1847\n. Haughton had attended\nMacCullagh\n's lectures\nOn the rotation of a solid body round a fixed point\nand he published a paper in the\nTransactions\nof the\nRoyal Irish Academy\nin\n1849\n\"Being an Account of the Late Professor\nMacCullagh\n's Lectures on That Subject\".\nIn addition to his interest in mathematics, Haughton was keen on geology. He may well have decided to concentrate his efforts on this topic so that he might be a strong candidate for the chair of geology which was soon to become vacant. He began undertaking research in geology and was appointed to the chair of geology at Trinity College, Dublin, in\n1851\nbut continued to hold his fellowship. From the time he was appointed to the fellowship, he had been in the School of Engineering, which had been established in\n1841\nmainly through the efforts of\nMacCullagh\n. Geology was in the School of Engineering so Haughton's work remained totally within this School. Haughton had not moved into a totally different area when he concentrated on geology since he had studied optical properties of crystals when working with\nMacCullagh\nand he could be considered as the world's leading expert on mathematical modelling in geophysics\n[\n9\n]\n:-\nA hot area in the geological research of the day concerned physical mechanisms of geological formation, and Haughton rapidly moved into this area in his work on tides. His geological researches eventually, and quite typically of Haughton, stretched over many fields including regional geography, stratigraphy, palaeontology, mineralogy, petrology, structural geology and economic geology\n(\nmining\n)\n.\nIf this was not a broad enough range of topics for any single person to undertake, Haughton registered as an undergraduate in medicine in\n1859\n. It was certainly a bold step for someone with his position and experience to sit down with undergraduates\n20\nyears his junior. We note that he continued to keep his fellowship and his chair of geology despite being a medical undergraduate. As we noted above, he had shown an interest in medicine before becoming an undergraduate and had published a couple of papers on the topic. However, it is likely that his real reason for taking on these undergraduate studies was to gain experience of a school that was in serious need of reform\n[\n15\n]\n:-\nFinding that the School of Physic in Ireland was inefficient and in need of reform, he conceived the scheme of entering it as a student and, having attended the classes and hospital, he graduated in medicine in\n1862\n.\nAs soon as he had graduated, Haughton set about reforming the medical school at Trinity College which was suffering both from poor governance from the College Board, who were ignorant of medicine, and from poor teaching by staff lacking motivation. Haughton was appointed registrar of Trinity Medical School in\n1864\nand this put him in a position to carry out a series of reforms. He organised the setting up of a\n3\n-man committee to look at medical education in the United Kingdom and, in particular, in Trinity College. The committee, chaired by Haughton, introduced a system of yearly reports so that the performance of different parts of the Medical School could be readily monitored. Some staff who were not carrying out their duties satisfactorily were dismissed and within a few years the School was running smoothly.\nHaughton was not only concerned with improving the Medical School but he looked for reforms of the whole Irish education system. He wrote an interesting essay on the topic in\n1868\nand we give the opening paragraphs at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nWe have looked at many positive aspects of Haughton's contributions, but there was one major negative contribution. Charles Darwin published his famous work on evolution\nOn the Origin of Species\nin\n1859\n. The first papers on evolution, by Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace, had been presented in London in\n1858\nby the geologist Charles Lyell and the botanist Joseph Dalton Hooker. Haughton must have seen copies of these papers for as early as\n9\nFebruary\n1859\n, before the publication of Darwin's famous book, Haughton attacked the theory at a meeting of the Geological Society of Dublin. The published version of his attack reads:-\nThis speculation of Mess. Darwin and Wallace would not be worthy of note were it not for the weight of authority of the names under whose auspices it has been brought forward. If it means what it says, it is a truism; if it means anything more, it is contrary to fact.\nDarwin later noted that Haughton's attack, which he understood to mean that \"all that\n[\nwas\n]\nnew in there was false, and what was true was old\" was the only attack on the papers. Haughton continued to attack Darwin's theory, writing in\n1860\n:-\n... to establish a character for subtlety and skill, in drawing large conclusions on this subject from slender premises, the first requisite is, ignorance of what other speculators have attempted before us in the same field: and the second is, a firm confidence in our own special theory. Neither of these requisites can be considered wanting in those who are engaged in the task of reproducing Lamarck's theory of organic life, either as altogether new, or with but a tattered threadbare cloak, thrown over its original nakedness.\nHaughton's continued opposition to the theory of evolution had, as one would expect, a negative effect on teaching in Trinity College Dublin for many years.\nAnother aspect of Haughton's work which we choose neither to describe as a positive contribution nor as a negative one is his paper\nOn Hanging considered from a Mechanical and Physiological point of view\nwhich was published in the\nLondon, Edinburgh and Dublin Philosophical Magazine\nin\n1866\n. Haughton argued that any humane hanging required a drop of sufficient length so that the person's neck was broken. Otherwise, he argued, the person was strangled and suffered much pain. He computed that a drop of\n4\n.\n5\n-metres was required to break the neck of a\n160\nlb\n(72\n.\n5\nkg\n)\nperson. His calculations, which were known as 'Haughton's Drop', were used in hanging people in Britain for many years.\nWe should mention some other contribution from this man of exceptionally broad interests. He worked on tides using data from around Ireland and from the Canadian Arctic. From this data he computed an estimate for the mass of the moon and its orbital eccentricity. He produced models of the earth and its internal structure. He calculated the age of the Earth from sediments deposited on the ocean floor and came up with an age of\n200\nmillion years. Although this is quite far from the correct value of around\n4600\nmillion years, it is better than the value that\nLord Kelvin\nhad found,\nKelvin\n's being the accepted value at the time that Haughton published his results. Haughton also used a variety of other techniques to find the age of the earth, one of which produced\n2300\nmillion years which he published even though it conflicted with his anti-evolutionist beliefs. Other work by Haughton that we should mention is the\n31\npapers he published on animal mechanics. As with so much of his work, this contained applied mathematics in the broadest sense.\nIt would appear that Haughton's ordination was mainly to obtain a fellowship but, although he had no pastoral duties, nevertheless he preached many sermons. However, only two of his sermons on 'The gospel of nature' and 'The death of Christ', both delivered in\n1881\n, were published. Among his most important books, in addition to those already mentioned, are\nManual of Geology\n(1865)\n,\nPrinciples of Animal\nMechanics\n(1873)\nand\nSix Lectures on Physical Geography\n(1880)\n.\nHis wife Louisa died in\n1888\n, and from then on Haughton's spinster sister\n(\nalso named Louisa\n)\nran his household.\nHaughton received many honours including election to the\nRoyal Irish Academy\n(1845)\n, election to the\nRoyal Society of London\n(1858)\n, and honorary degrees from the University of Oxford in\n1868\n, the University of Cambridge in\n1880\n, the University of Edinburgh in\n1884\n, and the University of Bologna in\n1888\n.\nAs to Haughton's character we quote from\n[\n15\n]\n:-\nThe personal charm of Dr Haughton's character was something which cannot be expressed in words, while to the outside public he was a brilliant speaker, a racy raconteur, a versatile genius, and a sagacious man of affairs; to the inner circle of his friends he was a wise and willing advisor, one ever ready to help and to guide, affectionate, sincere, and intensely sympathetic, a calm and simple Christian who in all his work ever kept clearly before him his responsibilities as a Christian teacher.\nHe had suffered from a heart problem for some time before his death at the age of\n76\n. His funeral was held in Trinity College, Dublin and, as the local paper reported at the time:-\n... the funeral then proceeded to Kingsbridge Railway Terminus Dublin for Carlow.\n[\nArriving at\n1\n.\n30]\nthe coffin was carried to the hearse by near relatives of the lamented deceased. On route through the town to the family burial ground at Killeshin the business houses were closed and blinds drawn in private dwellings as a mark of respect to the memory of one whose name and family have been creditably associated with the professional and commercial history of Carlow for considerably over a century.\nHaughton was further honoured on Sunday\n25\nAugust\n2005\nwhen a plaque was placed on the wall outside the house in Carlow in which he was born. As a final comment we should note that if Haughton had accepted Darwin's theory of evolution he would be better known and respected today. His arguments against evolution have diminished people's respect for the other work he undertook.",
