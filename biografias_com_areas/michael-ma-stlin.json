  "biografia": "Michael MÃ¤stlin\nwas born in GÃ¶ppingen which was a village about\n50\nkm east of TÃ¼bingen. His father, Jakob MÃ¤stlin, and his mother, Dorothea Simon, were both devout Lutherans and Michael was brought up in that faith and remained strongly committed to it throughout his life. He was the middle child of the family, having an older sister and a younger brother. He attended the monastic school in KÃ¶nigsbronn then, after his studies there, entered TÃ¼bingen University in\n1568\n.\n[\n3\n]\n:-\nAs was the case with many young scholars including\nKepler\n, his most famous student,\n[\nMÃ¤stlin\n]\ndid his undergraduate studies at a preparatory school and came to the university to take his final exams and pick up his baccalaureate degree.\nAt TÃ¼bingen University he studied mathematics and astronomy for a Master's degree under Philipp Apian who was\nPeter Apian\n's son. In\n1570\n, while a student, he purchased a copy of\nCopernicus\n's\nDe revolutionibus\nfrom the widow of Victorin Strigel, who had been professor of theology at Leipzig and the author of an astronomy text. MÃ¤stlin was awarded a Master's degree with distinction in\n1571\n. While studying for this degree he had edited a new edition of the\nPrutenis Tables\nwhich was published in\n1571\n. The\nPrutenis Tables\nhad been originally compiled by\nErasmus Reinhold\nwho had based them on\nCopernicus\n's version of the solar system. After graduating, MÃ¤stlin spent the following years teaching in TÃ¼bingen, and at the same time took\n[\n3\n]\n:-\n... the theological programme, because TÃ¼bingen University's primary mission was to prepare young men for the Lutheran ministry.\nThen, in\n1576\n, he was sent to be a deacon at the Lutheran Church in Backnang, a town about\n30\nkm northwest of GÃ¶ppingen. He married Margarete Gruuninger\n(1551\n-\n1588)\nin April\n1577\nnot long after he took up the position in Backnang; they had three sons and three daughters but Margarete died due to complications with the birth of their sixth child. MÃ¤stlin then married Margarete Burkhardt, daughter of a professor at TÃ¼bingen; they had eight children.\nMÃ¤stlin is famous for his excellent, very accurate, observations of the comet of\n1577\n, observed while he was in Backnang, and published in TÃ¼bingen in\n1578\nas\nObservatio et demonstratio cometae aetherae qui anno\n1577\net\n1578\nconstitutus in sphaera Veneris apparuit cum admirandius eius passionibus varietate scilicet motus loco orbe distantia a terro centro etc. adhibitis demonstrationibus geometricis et calculo arithmetico cuius modi de alio quoquam cometa nunquam visa est\nâ\n(\nObservations and demonstrations of the ethereal comets of the years\n1577\nand\n1578\n)\n. We discuss this achievement in more detail below. He remained in Backnang for four years, then was appointed as professor of mathematics at the University of Heidelberg in\n1580\n. There he published the first edition of his famous astronomy textbook\nEpitome astronomiae\n(1582)\n- he published six further editions of this popular work during his lifetime. Despite his commitment to the views of\nCopernicus\n(\nwhich we state below in his own words\n)\nthis teaching textbook was written purely as a description of astronomy based on the geocentric model of\nPtolemy\n.\nAfter four years in Heidelberg he returned to his position in TÃ¼bingen where he spent the rest of his career\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nAt TÃ¼bingen, MÃ¤stlin was elected dean of the arts faculty several times. He was well liked by both his colleagues and his students. MÃ¤stlin was very generous both to his family and to others. He was a religious man; he followed the Lutheran line in opposing the Gregorian calendar reform partly because it was initiated by the Pope. MÃ¤stlin had several students who became noted mathematicians, the most famous being\nKepler\n. MÃ¤stlin also maintained interests in Biblical chronology and geography.\nPerhaps his greatest achievement\n(\nother than being\nKepler\n's teacher\n)\nis that he was the first to compute the orbit of a comet, although his method was not sound. He found, however, a sun centred orbit for the comet of\n1577\nwhich he claimed supported\nCopernicus\n's heliocentric system. He did show that the comet was further away than the moon, which contradicted the accepted teachings of\nAristotle\n. Although clearly believing in the system as proposed by\nCopernicus\n, he taught astronomy using his own textbook which was based on\nPtolemy\n's system. However for the more advanced lectures he adopted the heliocentric approach -\nKepler\ncredited MÃ¤stlin with introducing him to Copernican ideas while he was a student at TÃ¼bingen\n(1589\n-\n94)\n. In\n[\n6\n]\nMethuen looks at these two different world systems in MÃ¤stlin's teaching. A G Molland reviews Methuen's paper:-\nMichael MÃ¤stlin is regularly ascribed a firm if minor place in accounts of the Astronomical Revolution, as the teacher of\nJohannes Kepler\nand as an early believer in the physical reality of the Copernican system. What has been less clear is how this related to his regular teaching at the University of TÃ¼bingen, with some having argued that he only taught Copernicanism cautiously and in private. Methuen examines this question in the light of Maestlin's published writings, including five sets of theses over whose disputations\n(\ntwo at Heidelberg, one at TÃ¼bingen\n)\nhe presided. She shows that he had no compunction about firmly asserting the supralunar position of the New Star of\n1572\nand of the comets of\n1577\n-\n1578\nand\n1580\n. In general, his writings, especially his textbook 'Epitome astronomiae' of\n1582\n, show no firm Copernican commitment, although there are signs of a leaning in that direction, and he was concerned with emphasizing the interconvertibility of hypotheses. His elementary teaching was certainly based on traditional astronomy, but Methuen concludes that he taught newer material to his more advanced students. She claims that he made a clear distinction between \"spheres\" and \"orbs\", with the former possessing physical reality and the latter being merely useful mathematical constructions ...\nMÃ¤stlin was both a great expert on spherical trigonometry and also a fine observer producing accurate data - the quality of his eyesight is seen from the fact that he saw, and sketched the positions of,\n11\nstars in the Pleiades cluster. Of course there were not any bright city lights around then, but we challenge any reader to equal this achievement however dark a site they find. He seems to have been the first to claim that the dark part of the moon shone through sunlight reflected from the earth but\nLeonardo da Vinci\nhas also been credited with this idea. Another first for MÃ¤stlin is an accurate calculation of the golden ratio as \"approximately\n0\n.\n6180340\n\" stated in a letter he wrote to\nKepler\nin\n1597\n.\nHe was an innovative thinker who was quite prepared to challenge conventional views. For example he attempted to measure the parallax of a supernova and, having failed to find any, deduced that it was as far away as the \"fixed stars\". This of course contradicted the view, held since\nAristotle\n, that all changes in the heavens occurred closer to earth than the realm of the stars which was unchanging.\nMÃ¤stlin lived to see the invention of the telescope for astronomical observations by\nGalileo\n. He had two, rather poor, telescopes with which he was able to observe sunspots and the moons of Jupiter. He was still making accurate observations at the age of\n78\nwhen he observed the lunar eclipse of\n1628\n.\nAs we mentioned above MÃ¤stlin acquired a copy of\nCopernicus\n's\nDe revolutionibus\nin\n1570\nand he wrote extensive notes near the beginning of the book. These give much insight into his views on\nCopernicus\nand we quote the notes using Gingerich's translations. MÃ¤stlin wrote that\n[\n3\n]\n:-\n... the arrangement presented in this book is the sort of structure in which all the sidereal motions and phenomena are explained very exactly. Therefore this hypothesis recommends itself to the intellect.\nMÃ¤stlin continued:-\nThe heavenly motions were at the point of collapse, and so\n[\nCopernicus\n]\nconcluded that appropriate hypotheses were needed to explain these motions. When he noticed that the common hypotheses were insufficient, he eventually accepted the idea of the Earth's mobility, since indeed, it not only satisfied the phenomena very well but it didn't lead to anything absurd.\nIn fact, if anyone would straighten out the common hypotheses so that they would agree with the phenomena and allow no inconsistencies, then I would gratefully trust him; clearly he would bring very many to his views. But I see that some, even very outstanding mathematicians, have laboured on this yet, in the end, without results. Therefore, I think that unless the common hypotheses are reformed\n(\na task that I am not up to because of my inadequate abilities\n)\n, I will accept the hypotheses and opinion of\nCopernicus\n- after\nPtolemy\n, the prince of all Astronomers.\nThere are further annotations written by MÃ¤stlin\n[\n3\n]\nwhich are very interesting. On the back of the title page of\nDe revolutionibus\nis the infamous notice which states that \"... these hypotheses need not be true nor even probable; it is sufficient if the calculations agree with the observations.\" MÃ¤stlin adds a note to his copy stating:-\nThis preface was added by someone, whoever its author may be,\n(\nfor indeed, its weakness of style and choice of words reveal that it is not by\nCopernicus\n)\n.\nHe later added a further note:-\nI found the following words written somewhere among the books of Philipp Apian\n(\nwhich I bought from his widow\n)\n; although no author was given I could recognise\nApian\n's hand:\nOn account of this letter\nGeorg Joachim Rheticus\n, the Leipzig professor and disciple of\nCopernicus\n, became involved in a very bitter wrangle with the printer, who asserted that it had been turned over to him with the rest of the work.\nRheticus\n, however, suspected that Osiander\n[\nthe proof-reader of\nCopernicus\n's book\n]\nhad prefaced it to the work. If he knew this for certain, he declared, he would handle that fellow so that in future he would mind his own business and not slander astronomers any more. Nevertheless,\n[\nPeter\n]\nApian\ntold me that Osiander had openly admitted to him that he had added this all by himself.",
