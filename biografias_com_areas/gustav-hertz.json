  "biografia": "Gustav Hertz\n's parents were Gustav Hertz and Auguste Arning. Gustav Hertz\n(\nsenior\n)\nwas a lawyer who was one of the brothers of\nHeinrich Hertz\n, the discoverer of wireless waves, who also has a biography in this archive. Gustav, the subject of this biography, attended the Johanneum\nGymnasium\nin Hamburg as his famous uncle had done about thirty years earlier. He graduated from the Johanneum in\n1906\nand entered the University of GÃ¶ttingen to study physics.\nAs was the custom with German students at this time, Hertz did not complete his studies at a single university, but moved around to sample the best of a number of institutions. After GÃ¶ttingen, Hertz moved to Munich where he studied at the university before moving to the University of Berlin in\n1909\nto study for his doctorate. In\n1911\nhe was awarded his doctorate for his thesis\nÃber das ultrarote Absorptionsspektrum der KohlensÃ¤ure in seiner AbhÃ¤ngigkeit von Druck und Partialdruck\nâ\n(\nOn the infra-red absorption spectrum of carbon dioxide in its dependence on pressure and partial pressure\n)\nwhich he had written with Heinrich Rubens and\nMax Planck\nas advisors. In his thesis he studied the infrared absorption of carbon dioxide in relation to pressure and partial pressure.\nIn\n1913\nHertz was appointed as an Assistant in Physics at the University of Berlin. At Berlin he worked with James Franck. Franck was five years older than Hertz and had been awarded his doctorate by the University of Berlin in\n1909\n. The two began their joint research project in\n1913\nand continued it until the outbreak of World War I in July-August\n1914\n. Both Hertz and Franck were mobilised when war broke out and their research collaboration necessarily stopped. However the work they had done led to their being jointly awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in\n1925\n. Their work confirmed experimentally quantum theory as proposed by\nBohr\nby showing that when an electron strikes an atom of mercury vapour, it must possess a certain minimum energy before that energy is absorbed by the atom. Moreover even if the electron had more than this minimum energy, it was only the exact minimum energy which was absorbed.\nThe war proved unfortunate for Hertz who was severely wounded in action in\n1915\n. After he recovered he was appointed as a\nPrivatdozent\nat the University of Berlin in\n1917\n. While holding this post he married Ellen Dihlmann in\n1919\n. They had two sons, Carl Hellmuth Hertz, born on\n15\nOctober\n1920\n, and Johannes Hertz who both became physicists. Hertz left Berlin in\n1920\nand worked for five years in the physics laboratory of the Philips Incandescent Lamp Factory at Eindhoven. In\n1925\nhe was appointed Professor of Physics and Director of the Physics Institute at the University of Halle. After being awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in\n1925\n, Hertz gave his Nobel lecture on The results of the electron-impact tests in the light of\nBohr\n's theory of atoms  on\n11\nDecember\n1926\n. In that lecture he gave the background to his highly significant experimental results:-\nThe significance of investigations on the ionization of atoms by electron impact is due to the fact that they have provided a direct experimental proof of the basic assumptions of\nBohr\n's theory of atoms. ... The fact that atoms are capable of exchanging energy with electromagnetic radiation, led the classical physicists to conclude that atoms must contain moving electrical charges. The oscillations of these charges produce the emission of light radiation, while light absorption was ascribed to forced oscillations of these charges owing to the electrical field of the light waves. On the basis of\nLorentz\n's theory of the normal Zeeman effect, of the magnetic splitting of the spectral lines, it was concluded that these moving charges must be the electrons to which we are acquainted in cathode rays. If only one or several spectral lines were associated with each type of atom, then it might be assumed that the atom contained, for each spectral line, an electron of corresponding characteristic frequency. In reality, however, the number of spectral lines emitted by each atom is infinitely large. The spectral lines are certainly not randomly distributed, on the contrary there exists a certain relationship between their frequencies, but this relationship is such that it is impossible on the basic of classical physics to explain it in terms of the characteristic frequencies of a system of electrons. Here\nBohr\nstepped in with his atomic theory. He applied\nPlanck\n's quantum theory to the problem of atomic structure and light emission, and thereby greatly extended this theory.\nIn\n1928\nhe was appointed Director of Physics Institute, Charlottenburg Technological University, Berlin. His main task now was less involved with research and more on the administrative side as he worked to rebuild the the Physics Institute. He did, however, continued at undertake research and, in\n1932\n, he made another significant breakthrough when he devised a method of separating the isotopes of neon. He had a grandfather was was Jewish and so when the Nazi Party came to power in\n1933\nhis position became difficult. On\n7\nApril\n1933\nthe Nazis passed a law which, under clause three, ordered the retirement of civil servants who were not of Aryan descent, with exemptions for participants in World War I and pre-war officials. Hertz qualified under the exemptions, but this was not honoured over the following period. Hertz resigned his positions at the Technological University of Berlin in\n1935\nand returned to industry being appointed Director of the Siemens physics laboratory. In\n1941\nHertz's wife Ellen died. He married again two years later to Charlotte Jollasse.\nWhen the war ended in\n1945\nHertz went to the Soviet Union where he worked as the head of a research laboratory. Returning to East Germany in\n1954\n, he was appointed Professor and Director of the Physics Institute at the Karl Marx University in Leipzig. He held this position until he retired in\n1961\n. After he retired he continued to live for a while in Leipzig, but then moved to Berlin where he spent the last years of his life.\nHertz received many honours in addition to the\n1925\nNobel Prize in Physics. As with the Nobel Prize, he received the\nMax Planck\nMedal of the German Physical Society in\n1951\njointly with James Franck. In addition he was elected to the\nGÃ¶ttingen Academy of Sciences\n, the\nHungarian Academy of Sciences\n, the\nCzech Academy of Sciences\n, and the\nUSSR Academy of Sciences\n.",
