  "biografia": "Alan Turing\nwas born at Paddington, London. His father, Julius Mathison Turing, was a British member of the Indian Civil Service and he was often abroad. Alan's mother, Ethel Sara Stoney, was the daughter of the chief engineer of the Madras railways and Alan's parents had met and married in India. When Alan was about one year old his mother rejoined her husband in India, leaving Alan in England with friends of the family. Alan was sent to school but did not seem to be obtaining any benefit so he was removed from the school after a few months.\nNext he was sent to Hazlehurst Preparatory School where he seemed to be an 'average to good' pupil in most subjects but was greatly taken up with following his own ideas. He became interested in chess while at this school and he also joined the debating society. He completed his Common Entrance Examination in\n1926\nand then went to Sherborne School. Now\n1926\nwas the year of the general strike and when the strike was in progress Turing cycled\n60\nmiles to the school from his home, not too demanding a task for Turing who later was to become a fine athlete of almost Olympic standard. He found it very difficult to fit into what was expected at this public school, yet his mother had been so determined that he should have a public school education. Many of the most original thinkers have found conventional schooling an almost incomprehensible process and this seems to have been the case for Turing. His genius drove him in his own directions rather than those required by his teachers.\nHe was criticised for his handwriting, struggled at English, and even in mathematics he was too interested with his own ideas to produce solutions to problems using the methods taught by his teachers. Despite producing unconventional answers, Turing did win almost every possible mathematics prize while at Sherborne. In chemistry, a subject which had interested him from a very early age, he carried out experiments following his own agenda which did not please his teacher. Turing's headmaster wrote\n(\nsee for example\n[\n6\n]\n)\n:-\nIf he is to stay at Public School, he must aim at becoming educated. If he is to be solely a Scientific Specialist, he is wasting his time at a Public School.\nThis says far more about the school system that Turing was being subjected to than it does about Turing himself. However, Turing learnt deep mathematics while at school, although his teachers were probably not aware of the studies he was making on his own. He read\nEinstein\n's papers on relativity and he also read about\nquantum mechanics\nin\nEddington\n's\nThe nature of the physical world\n.\nAn event which was to greatly affect Turing throughout his life took place in\n1928\n. He formed a close friendship with Christopher Morcom, a pupil in the year above him at school, and the two worked together on scientific ideas. Perhaps for the first time Turing was able to find someone with whom he could share his thoughts and ideas. However Morcom died in February\n1930\nand the experience was a shattering one to Turing. He had a premonition of Morcom's death at the very instant that he was taken ill and felt that this was something beyond what science could explain. He wrote later\n(\nsee for example\n[\n6\n]\n)\n:-\nIt is not difficult to explain these things away - but, I wonder!\nDespite the difficult school years, Turing entered King's College, Cambridge, in\n1931\nto study mathematics. This was not achieved without difficulty. Turing sat the scholarship examinations in\n1929\nand won an exhibition, but not a scholarship. Not satisfied with this performance, he took the examinations again in the following year, this time winning a scholarship. In many ways Cambridge was a much easier place for unconventional people like Turing than school had been. He was now much more able to explore his own ideas and he read\nRussell\n's\nIntroduction to mathematical philosophy\nin\n1933\n. At about the same time he read\nvon Neumann\n's\n1932\ntext on quantum mechanics, a subject he returned to a number of times throughout his life.\nThe year\n1933\nsaw the beginnings of Turing's interest in mathematical logic. He read a paper to the Moral Science Club at Cambridge in December of that year of which the following minute was recorded\n(\nsee for example\n[\n6\n]\n)\n:-\nA M Turing read a paper on \"Mathematics and logic\". He suggested that a purely logistic view of mathematics was inadequate; and that mathematical propositions possessed a variety of interpretations of which the logistic was merely one.\nOf course\n1933\nwas also the year of Hitler's rise in Germany and of an anti-war movement in Britain. Turing joined the anti-war movement but he did not drift towards Marxism, nor pacifism, as happened to many.\nTuring graduated in\n1934\nthen, in the spring of\n1935\n, he attended\nMax Newman\n's advanced course on the foundations of mathematics. This course studied\nGÃ¶del\n's incompleteness results and\nHilbert\n's question on decidability. In one sense 'decidability' was a simple question, namely given a mathematical proposition could one find an algorithm which would decide if the proposition was true of false. For many propositions it was easy to find such an algorithm. The real difficulty arose in proving that for certain propositions no such algorithm existed. When given an algorithm to solve a problem it was clear that it was indeed an algorithm, yet there was no definition of an algorithm which was rigorous enough to allow one to prove that none existed. Turing began to work on these ideas.\nTuring was elected a fellow of King's College, Cambridge, in\n1935\nfor a dissertation\nOn the Gaussian error function\nwhich proved fundamental results on\nprobability theory\n, namely the\ncentral limit theorem\n. Although the central limit theorem had recently been discovered, Turing was not aware of this and discovered it independently. In\n1936\nTuring was a Smith's Prizeman.\nTuring's achievements at Cambridge had been on account of his work in probability theory. However, he had been working on the decidability questions since attending\nNewman\n's course. In\n1936\nhe published\nOn Computable Numbers, with an application to the Entscheidungsproblem\n. It is in this paper that Turing introduced an abstract machine, now called a \"Turing machine\", which moved from one state to another using a precise finite set of rules\n(\ngiven by a finite table\n)\nand depending on a single symbol it read from a tape.\nThe Turing machine could write a symbol on the tape, or delete a symbol from the tape. Turing wrote\n[\n13\n]\n:-\nSome of the symbols written down will form the sequences of figures which is the decimal of the real number which is being computed. The others are just rough notes to \"assist the memory\". It will only be these rough notes which will be liable to erasure.\nHe defined a computable number as real number whose decimal expansion could be produced by a Turing machine starting with a blank tape. He showed that Ï was computable, but since only countably many real numbers are computable, most real numbers are not computable. He then described a number which is not computable and remarks that this seems to be a paradox since he appears to have described in finite terms, a number which cannot be described in finite terms. However, Turing understood the source of the apparent paradox. It is impossible to decide\n(\nusing another Turing machine\n)\nwhether a Turing machine with a given table of instructions will output an infinite sequence of numbers.\nAlthough this paper contains ideas which have proved of fundamental importance to mathematics and to computer science ever since it appeared, publishing it in the\nProceedings of the London Mathematical Society\ndid not prove easy. The reason was that\nAlonzo Church\npublished\nAn unsolvable problem in elementary\nnumber theory\nin the\nAmerican Journal of Mathematics\nin\n1936\nwhich also proves that there is no decision procedure for arithmetic. Turing's approach is very different from that of\nChurch\nbut\nNewman\nhad to argue the case for publication of Turing's paper before the\nLondon Mathematical Society\nwould publish it. Turing's revised paper contains a reference to\nChurch\n's results and the paper, first completed in April\n1936\n, was revised in this way in August\n1936\nand it appeared in print in\n1937\n.\nA good feature of the resulting discussions with\nChurch\nwas that Turing became a graduate student at Princeton University in\n1936\n. At Princeton, Turing undertook research under\nChurch\n's supervision and he returned to England in\n1938\n, having been back in England for the summer vacation in\n1937\nwhen he first met\nWittgenstein\n. The major publication which came out of his work at Princeton was\nSystems of Logic Based on Ordinals\nwhich was published in\n1939\n.\nNewman\nwrites in\n[\n13\n]\n:-\nThis paper is full of interesting suggestions and ideas. ...\n[\nIt\n]\nthrows much light on Turing's views on the place of intuition in mathematical proof.\nBefore this paper appeared, Turing published two other papers on rather more conventional mathematical topics. One of these papers discussed methods of approximating\nLie groups\nby finite\ngroups\n. The other paper proves results on extensions of groups, which were first proved by\nReinhold Baer\n, giving a simpler and more unified approach.\nPerhaps the most remarkable feature of Turing's work on Turing machines was that he was describing a modern computer before technology had reached the point where construction was a realistic proposition. He had proved in his\n1936\npaper that a universal Turing machine existed\n[\n13\n]\n:-\n... which can be made to do the work of any special-purpose machine, that is to say to carry out any piece of computing, if a tape bearing suitable \"instructions\" is inserted into it.\nAlthough to Turing a \"computer\" was a person who carried out a computation, we must see in his description of a universal Turing machine what we today think of as a computer with the tape as the program.\nWhile at Princeton Turing had played with the idea of constructing a computer. Once back at Cambridge in\n1938\nhe starting to build an analogue mechanical device to investigate the\nRiemann hypothesis\n, which many consider today the biggest unsolved problem in mathematics. However, his work would soon take on a new aspect for he was contacted, soon after his return, by the Government Code and Cypher School who asked him to help them in their work on breaking the German Enigma codes.\nWhen war was declared in\n1939\nTuring immediately moved to work full-time at the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park. Although the work carried out at Bletchley Park was covered by the Official Secrets Act, much has recently become public knowledge. Turing's brilliant ideas in solving codes, and developing computers to assist break them, may have saved more lives of military personnel in the course of the war than any other. It was also a happy time for him\n[\n13\n]\n:-\n... perhaps the happiest of his life, with full scope for his inventiveness, a mild routine to shape the day, and a congenial set of fellow-workers.\nTogether with another mathematician W G Welchman, Turing developed the\nBombe\n, a machine based on earlier work by Polish mathematicians, which from late\n1940\nwas decoding all messages sent by the Enigma machines of the Luftwaffe. The Enigma machines of the German navy were much harder to break but this was the type of challenge which Turing enjoyed. By the middle of\n1941\nTuring's statistical approach, together with captured information, had led to the German navy signals being decoded at Bletchley.\nFrom November\n1942\nuntil March\n1943\nTuring was in the United States liaising over decoding issues and also on a speech secrecy system. Changes in the way the Germans encoded their messages had meant that Bletchley lost the ability to decode the messages. Turing was not directly involved with the successful breaking of these more complex codes, but his ideas proved of the greatest importance in this work. Turing was awarded the O.B.E. in\n1945\nfor his vital contribution to the war effort.\nAt the end of the war Turing was invited by the National Physical Laboratory in London to design a computer. His report proposing the Automatic Computing Engine\n(\nACE\n)\nwas submitted in March\n1946\n. Turing's design was at that point an original detailed design and prospectus for a computer in the modern sense. The size of storage he planned for the ACE was regarded by most who considered the report as hopelessly over-ambitious and there were delays in the project being approved.\nTuring returned to Cambridge for the academic year\n1947\n-\n48\nwhere his interests ranged over many topics far removed from computers or mathematics; in particular he studied neurology and physiology. He did not forget about computers during this period, however, and he wrote code for programming computers. He had interests outside the academic world too, having taken up athletics seriously after the end of the war. He was a member of Walton Athletic Club winning their\n3\nmile and\n10\nmile championship in record time. He ran in the A.A.A. Marathon in\n1947\nand was placed fifth.\nBy\n1948\nNewman\nwas the professor of mathematics at the University of Manchester and he offered Turing a readership there. Turing resigned from the National Physical Laboratory to take up the post in Manchester. Newman writes in\n[\n13\n]\nthat in Manchester:-\n... work was beginning on the construction of a computing machine by F C Williams and T Kilburn. The expectation was that Turing would lead the mathematical side of the work, and for a few years he continued to work, first on the design of the subroutines out of which the larger programs for such a machine are built, and then, as this kind of work became standardised, on more general problems of numerical analysis.\nIn\n1950\nTuring published\nComputing machinery and intelligence\nin\nMind\n. It is another remarkable work from his brilliantly inventive mind which seemed to foresee the questions which would arise as computers developed. He studied problems which today lie at the heart of artificial intelligence. It was in this\n1950\npaper that he proposed the Turing Test which is still today the test people apply in attempting to answer whether a computer can be intelligent\n[\n1\n]\n:-\n... he became involved in discussions on the contrasts and similarities between machines and brains. Turing's view, expressed with great force and wit, was that it was for those who saw an unbridgeable gap between the two to say just where the difference lay.\nTuring did not forget about questions of decidability which had been the starting point for his brilliant mathematical publications. One of the main problems in the theory of\ngroup presentations\nwas the question: given any word in a finitely presented groups is there an algorithm to decide if the word is equal to the identity.\nPost\nhad proved that for\nsemigroups\nno such algorithm exist. Turing thought at first that he had proved the same result for groups but, just before giving a seminar on his proof, he discovered an error. He was able to rescue from his faulty proof the fact that there was a cancellative semigroup with insoluble word problem and he published this result in\n1950\n.\nBoone\nused the ideas from this paper by Turing to prove the existence of a group with insoluble word problem in\n1957\n.\nTuring was elected a Fellow of the\nRoyal Society of London\nin\n1951\n, mainly for his work on Turing machines in\n1936\n. By\n1951\nhe was working on the application of mathematical theory to biological forms. In\n1952\nhe published the first part of his theoretical study of morphogenesis, the development of pattern and form in living organisms.\nTuring was arrested for violation of British homosexuality statutes in\n1952\nwhen he reported to the police details of a homosexual affair. He had gone to the police because he had been threatened with blackmail. He was tried as a homosexual on\n31\nMarch\n1952\n, offering no defence other than that he saw nothing wrong in his actions. Found guilty he was given the alternatives of prison or oestrogen injections for a year. He accepted the latter and returned to a wide range of academic pursuits.\nOn\n10\nSeptember\n2009\n, the British Prime Minister Gordon Brown made an official public apology on behalf of the British government for the way in which Turing had been treated after the war.\nNot only did he press forward with further study of morphogenesis, but he also worked on new ideas in quantum theory, on the representation of elementary particles by spinors, and on relativity theory. Although he was completely open about his sexuality, he had a further unhappiness which he was forbidden to talk about due to the Official Secrets Act.\nThe decoding operation at Bletchley Park became the basis for the new decoding and intelligence work at GCHQ. With the cold war this became an important operation and Turing continued to work for GCHQ, although his Manchester colleagues were totally unaware of this. After his conviction, his security clearance was withdrawn. Worse than that, security officers were now extremely worried that someone with complete knowledge of the work going on at GCHQ was now labelled a security risk. He had many foreign colleagues, as any academic would, but the police began to investigate his foreign visitors. A holiday which Turing took in Greece in\n1953\ncaused consternation among the security officers.\nTuring died of potassium cyanide poisoning while conducting electrolysis experiments. The cyanide was found on a half eaten apple beside him. An inquest concluded that it was self-administered but his mother always maintained that it was an accident.",
