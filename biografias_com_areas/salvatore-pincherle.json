  "biografia": "Salvatore Pincherle\nwas born in Trieste\n(\npart of Austria at the time\n)\ninto a Jewish family. After the unification of Italy in\n1860\n, Trieste remained the Imperial Free City of Trieste, the capital of the Austrian Littoral region, and the main Austrian commercial port. Salvatore's father was a business man and, after Salvatore had begun his education in Trieste, he moved to Marseilles taking his family with him. This move was made since the family were liberals, strongly in favour of Trieste becoming part of Italy and, since his father expressed these views openly, they were being oppressed by the local police\n[\n9\n]\n:-\nPincherle spent his childhood and adolescence in a small and cosy family atmosphere, where the intimacy of affection was strengthened by the sadness of exile and the passionate expectation of the historical events which, between the years\n1859\nand\n1870\n, were leading to the unification of his homeland.\nPinchele's mother, a very learned lady with excellent taste, was the young boy's first teacher. Then Pincherle began his school education at the LycÃ©e ImpÃ©rial\n(\nnow the LycÃ©e Thiers\n)\nin Marseilles. His initial interests were in the humanities, but the school in Marseilles specialised in science teaching and Pincherle soon became fascinated with mathematics through excellent teaching there. His childhood education, however, gave him a love for music and literature, and these interests continued throughout his life\n[\n5\n]\n:-\nIn his last years he still played piano nearly every day, and reread the works of his favourite author, HonorÃ© de Balzac.\nLeaving his father's home in Marseilles when his schooling was complete at the end of\n1869\n, Pincherle went to Pisa where he won the competition for a place at the Scuola Normale Superiore. In\n1870\nhe began his study of mathematics. He was taught by\nEnrico Betti\nwho, after working in mathematical physics, was undertaking research in analysis and laying the foundations of general\ntopology\n.\nBetti\nwas a strong influence on Pincherle as was\nUlisse Dini\nwho, after working on\ndifferential geometry\nwas, by this time, studying and teaching the foundations for the theory of functions of a real variable. Pincherle graduated with his laurea in\n1874\n, also earning in the same year his right to lecture, the 'libera docenza', having submitted his two-part thesis\nSulle superficie di capillaritÃ\nâ\n(\nOn the capillary surface\n)\nand\nSulle costanti di capillaritÃ\nâ\n(\nOn the constant of capillarity\n)\n.\nThe quality of his work at the Scuola Normale Superiore of Pisa was very high and it was clear that Pincherle had shown that he had a very promising career in front of him as a university teacher. However, to go down that road would have meant that Pincherle would have had to have been supported by his father and he decided that he did not want to put any financial strain on the family. He decided, therefore, to seek a position as a secondary school teacher. He was appointed to the Regio Ginnasio Liceale of Pavia\n(\ntoday the Liceo Foscolo\n)\nwhere he taught the course\nSulle superficie d'area minima\nâ\n(\nOn minimum surface area\n)\n. However, in addition to his high school teaching, he also made contact with\nFelice Casorati\nat the University of Pavia. In\n1876\nEugenio Beltrami\nwas appointed to the chair of mathematical physics at Pavia and he and\nCasorati\nhad a major influence on Pincherle\n[\n9\n]\n:-\nSo, in that quiet place, Pincherle found new cultural support, new ideas and a new direction to his scientific work, and, with the freshness and energy of youth, he learned to impose severe discipline of work, which from then on he constantly observed throughout his long life, and it allowed him not to deviate from his research, even amid the cares of school teaching, to which he devoted himself with tireless fervour.\nCasorati\nand\nBeltrami\nquickly had Pincherle interested in the new approach to analysis that\nBernhard Riemann\nwas taking. They encouraged Pincherle to apply for a postgraduate scholarship to enable him to study abroad for a year. He spent his year abroad in Germany, studying at the University of Berlin. During the academic year\n1877\n-\n78\nthat he spent in Berlin, he attended lecture courses by\nKummer\n,\nKronecker\nand\nWeierstrass\n. However, it was\nWeierstrass\nwho was the strongest influence on him and all his mathematical work from this time on shows the influence of the great mathematician. He returned to Pavia in the autumn of\n1878\nand resumed his work as a teacher at the Liceo. However, he was invited to give a course of lectures at the University of Pavia and he gave\nTeorica delle funzioni analitiche secondo Weierstrass\nâ\n(\nTheory of analytic functions according to Weierstrass\n)\n, presenting, for the first time in Italy,\nWeierstrass\n's approach to analysis. He published these lecture notes as\nSaggio di una introduzione alla teoria delle funzioni analitiche secondo i principi del prof. C Weierstrass\nâ\n(\nAn introduction to the theory of analytic functions according to the principles of C Weierstrass\n)\nin\nGiuseppe Battaglini\n's\nGiornale di Matematiche\nin\n1880\n. This work is important both in the development of analysis and in particular the progress of mathematics in Italy.\nLet us say a little about Pincherle's family at this point. He married Emma Morpurgo and their son, Maurizio Pincherle, was born in Pavia on\n13\nNovember\n1879\n. Maurizio studied medicine and was appointed Professor in the Pediatric Clinic at the University of Bologna in\n1929\n. Maurizio married Gilda Carneo and their son, Leo Pincherle\n(1910\n-\n1976)\nbecame a physicist, while another son, Mario Pincherle\n(1919\n-\n)\n, studied both classics and engineering, and became a famous archaeologist. Salvatore and Emma Pincherle also had a daughter, Edvige Pincherle, who married Graziano Senigaglia. Graziano and Edvige had a daughter, Emma Senigaglia\n(1909\n-\n1991)\n, who became a mathematician, studying for her doctorate at Bologna advised by\nGiuseppe Vitali\n.\nLet us return to Salvatore Pincherle's biography. In the spring of\n1880\n, following a competition, he was appointed to the chair of algebraic analysis and analytic geometry at the University of Palermo. It was a post he only held for a few months for he was offered a similar chair at the University of Bologna. He accepted the post which he continued to hold until he retired in\n1928\n. At Bologna, Pincherle became a colleague of Luigi Donati\n(1846\n-\n1932)\n, who was appointed to Bologna in\n1877\n, and\nCesare ArzelÃ\nwho had been appointed to the chair of Infinitesimal Calculus in\n1880\n. All three of these mathematicians were graduates of the Scuola Normale Superiore of Pisa and they quickly improved the department at Bologna which had somewhat lost its vigour\n[\n9\n]\n:-\nSupported by exceptional learning, which never ceased to deepen and extend, even outside of his favourite field of work and beyond the boundaries of mathematics, he varied the topics of his courses from year to year, while always trying to illustrate the general theory of analytic functions in its historical setting both in its various orientations and in its relations with other branches of analysis.\nWe can only give a very few indications of the wide range of Pincherle's contributions since the list of his publications\n(\nsee\n[\n15\n]\n)\ncontains\n271\nitems. His research mainly concerned functional equations and\nfunctional analysis\n. Together with\nVito Volterra\n, he can claim to be one of the founders of functional analysis.\nFrancesco Tricomi\nwrites in\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nRemaining faithful to the ideas of\nWeierstrass\n, he did not take the topological approach that later proved to be most successful, but tried to start from a series of powers of the D derivation symbol. Although his efforts did not prove very fruitful, he was able to study in depth the\nLaplace transform\n, iteration problems, and series of generalised factors.\nJean-Luc Dorier expresses a high opinion of Pincherle's contributions in\n[\n4\n]\n:-\nFrom about\n1890\n, Pincherle published several papers in which he used the axiomatic approach with differential and\nintegral equations\n. In\n1901\n, with one of his students,\nUgo Amaldi\n, he published a book entitled 'Le Operazioni Distributive e le loro applicazioni all'analisi', in which the authors presented an axiomatic theory of functional operators. Although Pincherle referred to\nGrassmann\nand\nPeano\n, his approach went far beyond the framework of geometry and placed itself in quite a general context using, in particular, infinite-dimensional linear spaces. In this sense, his work was quite unusual for its time, since the use of axiomatic theory for infinite dimension was not much investigated until after\n1920\n...\n[\nHowever\n]\nhis work had very little influence on the development of what would become functional analysis. The reasons for this lack of influence are partly due to the fact that such a general and formal axiomatic approach as proposed by Pincherle did not meet the concerns of most mathematicians in the first years of the\n20\nth\ncentury. Indeed, the conception of a function as a series of coefficients was still dominant at this time ...\nThis book is quite remarkable in presenting ideas well ahead of its time. Pincherle defined the notion of dimension and basis, showing that in a set consisting of all linear combinations of\nn\nn\nn\nindependent elements,\nn\n+\n1\nn+1\nn\n+\n1\nelements are always dependent. He defined rank in an abstract way, then related it to the rank of a matrix. He then went on to look at linear operators, proving results which hold in both finite dimensional and infinite dimensional spaces. He also studied linear sets of numerical sequences and of\nLaurent\nseries. He considered different operators, including differential operators and difference operators. Despite these far-sighted contributions, his work had little impact\n[\n4\n]\n:-\n... even though he was the author of the article on functional equations and operators in the French version of the \"EncyclopÃ©die des mathÃ©matique pures et appliquÃ©es\"\n(1912)\n, in which he gave a very detailed historical account and referred to his own work, Pincherle's work itself did not have much influence.\nIn\n[\n18\n]\n(\nsee also\n[\n17\n]\n)\nFrancesco Mainardi and Gianni Pagnini discuss another very significant contribution by Pincherle:-\n... the\n1888\npaper\n(\nin Italian\n)\nof S Pincherle on the 'Generalized Hypergeometric Functions' led him to introduce the afterwards named\nMellin\n-\nBarnes\nintegral to represent the solution of a generalized\nhypergeometric\ndifferential equation investigated by\nGoursat\nin\n1883\n. Pincherle's priority was explicitly recognized by\nMellin\nand\nBarnes\nthemselves ... In\n1907\nBarnes\n... wrote: \"The idea of employing contour integrals involving gamma functions of the variable in the subject of integration appears to be due to Pincherle, whose suggestive paper was the starting point of the investigations of\nMellin\n(1895)\nthough the type of contour and its use can be traced back to\nRiemann\n.\" In\n1910\nMellin\n... devoted a section\n(\nProof of Theorems of Pincherle\n)\nto revisit the original work of Pincherle ...\nIn\n1915\nPincherle published his lecture notes as\nLezioni di Calcolo Infinitesimale Dettata Nella R. Universita di Bologna e Redatte per uso Degli Studenti\nâ\n(\nLessons in infinitesimal calculus given at the University of Bologna and drafted for use of students\n)\n. These were very popular and, in\n1919\nhe published a second edition in which he wrote\n[\n27\n]\n:-\nThe lectures on the infinitesimal calculus which I gave to the press at the end of\n1915\n, not without fear and trembling, have won favour beyond all expectations with the mathematical public ...\nA third edition appeared in\n1926\n.\nIn addition to his remarkable research contributions and his university teaching, Pincherle was also involved in school level mathematics. He participated in the management of the teacher's college at Bologna and wrote a number of school level textbooks. For example\nGli elementi dell'Aritmetica\nâ\n(\nElements of arithmetic\n)\nwas first published in\n1891\nand ran to eighteen editions, the last being published in\n1934\n. Similarly\nAlgebra elementare\nâ\n(\nElementary algebra\n)\nran to thirteen editions between\n1883\nand\n1920\n,\nGeometria pura elementare\nâ\n(\nElementary pure geometry\n)\nran to eight editions between\n1881\nand\n1918\n, and\nGeometria metrica e Trigonometria\nâ\n(\nMetric geometry and trigonometry\n)\nran to ten editions between\n1882\nand\n1933\n. He also published problem books such as\nEsercizi sull'Algebra elementare\nâ\n(\nExercises in elementary algebra\n)\n(1896)\nand\nEsercizi sulla Geometria elementare\nâ\n(\nExercises in elementary geometry\n)\n(1897)\n. He contributed several articles to encyclopaedias, one of which we have already mentioned above. Articles which appeared in the\nEnciclopedia Italiana di Scienze, Lettere ed Arti\nâ\n(\nItalian Encyclopedia of Science, Arts and Letters\n)\nare\nDeterminanti\nâ\n(\nDeterminants\n)\n(1931)\n,\nFunzioni notevoli\nâ\n(\nNotable Functions\n)\n(1932)\nand an obituary of\nKarl Weierstrass\n(1937)\n. He served as an editor of the\nAnnali di matematica pura ed applicata\nfrom\n1918\n.\nThe Unione Matematica Italiana\n(\nItalian Mathematical Union\n)\nwas established in Bologna by Pincherle on\n7\nDecember\n1922\n. He became the Union's first President and the first editor of the\nBolletino dell'Unione Matematica Italiana\n, a role he held until his death in\n1936\n. Carlo Pucci discusses Pincherle's efforts to set up the Union in\n[\n26\n]\n. Pincherle was supported by\nLuigi Bianchi\nand\nVito Volterra\nbut many other leading Italian mathematicians did not support the idea, being quite happy with regional societies such as the\nCircolo Matematico di Palermo\n. The fact that the\nInternational Mathematical Union\nwas founded in\n1920\ndid much to help Pincherle persuade others for the need for the\nUnione Matematica Italiana\n.\nHe attended the International Congress of Mathematicians held at Toronto, Canada, in August\n1924\nwhere he was one of the plenary speakers giving the lecture\nSulle operazioni funzionali lineari\n. At this Congress, he was elected president of the\nInternational Mathematical Union\nfor the eight-year period\n1924\n-\n32\n. He invited the Congress to Bologna for the\n1928\nCongress but it was decided to delay a decision on whether to accept. There were severe political problems, for neither the\n1920\nStrasbourg Congress nor the\n1924\nToronto Congress had not been truly international since German mathematicians had not been allowed to attend due to World War I. Bologna was accepted for the\n1928\nInternational Congress of Mathematicians with Pincherle as president. It was through his efforts that German mathematicians were allowed to attend the Congress. Basically he achieved this by having the invitation to the\n1928\nCongress coming from the University of Bologna and inviting mathematicians directly. The\nInternational Mathematical Union\n's policy was directly opposed to this; they wanted invitations to be made only through mathematical societies. Since Pincherle was president of the\nInternational Mathematical Union\nhe was in a very difficult position and it was with great political skill that he succeeded. Of course, some mathematicians refused to attend but it was a truly international meeting. In his opening address to the Congress as its President, Pincherle said:-\n... if one does not ask those invited to which country or school they belong, but only if they support the progress of science and its benefits, who will be able to refuse their support, who will want to perpetuate the quarrels in that area when one seeks only the agreement of reason.\nAt a meeting of the\nInternational Mathematical Union\nwhich Pincherle chaired in September\n1928\n, a resolution was unanimously adopted supporting all Pincherle's actions. Despite this strong support, he informed the delegates that he was stepping down as president since his efforts in that role had exhausted him. The authors of\n[\n7\n]\nwrite:-\nThe Bologna Congress stands as Pincherle's personal 'tour de force'. He judged the mood of the majority of mathematicians in the world correctly and through a series of hard negotiations, he found his way around roadblocks with patience yet with determination.\nPincherle received many honours for his contributions. He was elected to the\nReale Accademia dei Lincei\nin\n1887\n. He received the first Royal Prize for Mathematics, established by Umberto I in\n1878\nand awarded by a commission of the\nReale Accademia dei Lincei\n, in\n1889\n.\nLuigi Bianchi\nalso received a Royal Prize at the same time. Pincherle was awarded the Sacchetti prize by the city of Bologna when he was appointed to the chair there in\n1928\n. He was elected to the\nNational Academy of Sciences of Italy\n(\nthe \"Academy of Forty\"\n)\n, the Reale Accademia delle Scienze of the Institute of Bologna, the Reale Accademia delle Scienze of the Institute of Turin, the Reale Istituto Lombardo di Scienze e Lettere, the Reale Istituto Veneto, the Accademia Pontaniana of Naples, the\nRoyal Society of Edinburgh\n, the Bavarian Academy of Sciences, the Academy of Science of Coimbra, the Helvetic Society of Sciences, and made an honorary member of the\nMoscow Mathematical Society\nand the Calcutta Mathematical Society. He was awarded an honorary degree by the University of Oslo. He was a member of the National Research Council and the Governing Council of the\nCircolo Matematico di Palermo\n. He was frequently dean of the Faculty of Sciences at Bologna and president of the Academy of Sciences of Bologna.\nFinally, we note that in\n1925\nthe \"Manifesto of Fascist Intellectuals\", establishing the political and cultural foundations of Fascism, was published in Bologna. Pincherle was one of the signatories of the Manifesto but he died before the Fascist regime published its \"Manifesto of Race\" in\n1938\nwhich dismissed Jews from university positions. Pincherle's closest friend over the last years of his life had been his colleague\nBeppo Levi\nwho had signed the \"oath to Fascism\" in\n1931\nbut was dismissed under the Manifesto of Race.",
