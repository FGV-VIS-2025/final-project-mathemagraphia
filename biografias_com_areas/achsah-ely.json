  "biografia": "Achsah Mount Ely\nwas the daughter of Joseph J Ely\n(1814\n-\n1885)\nand Catherine Conover\n(1815\n-\n1901)\n. Joseph Ely was a farmer who married Catherine Conover on\n24\nDecember\n1840\n; they had eight children. William Ely was born on\n26\nAugust\n1842\nand died when just over one year old on\n14\nDecember\n1843\n. Their second child, Jane Eliza Ely was born on\n17\nOctober\n1844\n, followed by Achsah Mount Ely on\n10\nNovember\n1845\n, who is the subject of this biography. Several of Achsah's younger siblings died when babies: Catherine Louisa Ely\n(1848\n-\n1850)\n; Emma Ely\n(1853\n-\n1854)\n; and Charles Henry Ely\n(1856\n-\n1856)\n. Helen A Ely\n(1857\n-\n1874)\ndied aged seventeen. The only two of her younger siblings to live adult lives were Ann Hunt Ely\n(1850\n-\n1918)\nand Katherine Ely\n(1859\n-\n1927)\n. Of the four children who lived to adulthood, only one, Ann Hunt Ely, married.\nAchsah Ely studied at the Young Ladies' Seminary, Freehold, New Jersey, graduating in\n1863\n. The Freehold Young Ladies' Seminary was founded by Amos Richardson in\n1844\nand operated for several decades, at least through to the\n1880\ns\n[\n3\n]\n:-\nThe Freehold Young Ladies' Seminary emphasised that its \"extensive\" course of study \"requires a longer period than is usually devoted to study by young Ladies; but it is believed not to be more extensive than the present state of society demands.\"\nAfter graduating from the Freehold Young Ladies' Seminary in\n1863\n, she waited for Vassar College to accept its first classes and she entered the College in\n1865\n. This women's college was the first of the \"seven sister\" colleges and had been founded by Matthew Vassar in Poughkeepsie, New York in\n1861\n. Building began in\n1863\nand the first class was admitted in\n1865\n. She was taught by Charles S Farrar\n(1826\n-\n1903)\n, who was Vassar's first professor of mathematics, chemistry, and physics. Farrar was described as \"man of wonderful magnetism, a subtle intellect, and a power of presentation that made the students breathless on his prayers and his lectures.\" Ely also studied astronomy with\nMaria Mitchell\nand was one of the graduates of Vassar College who travelled to Burlington, Iowa with\nMitchell\nto observe the\n7\nAugust\n1869\nsolar eclipse. They used a three-inch Alvan Clark telescope which had been specially made for the occasion. In\n1867\nEly is listed as one of\n18\nstudents in the Junior Class, with her address Manalapan, Monmouth County, New Jersey. She graduated from Vassar College in on\n24\nJune\n1868\nand she was one of eight students chosen to read their work at the Commencement; she read \"The Philosophy of Herbert Spencer\".\nAfter the award of an A.B. from Vassar College, she served for two years as a woman teacher at the Connecticut Literary Institute in Suffield, Connecticut. The Institute had been founded in\n1833\nto train young men for the ministry in the Baptist Church but soon, as the only high school in Suffield, became non-denominational with both men and women students. It received local government funding helped to pay for each student's tuition. The Institute had both men and women as teachers, but it is not clear whether the women teachers only taught the female students. Certainly the women were paid less than the men and they all appear to remain at the Institute for only one or two years.\nEly's next appointment was as a Higher Mathematics teacher at the Peddie Institute at Hightstown, New Jersey in September\n1872\n. The Peddie School was founded in\n1864\nas the Hightstown Female Seminary, a Baptist preparatory school. Later that year, boys were admitted, and the school began a series of name changes. In\n1872\n, the school took its current name in honour of philanthropist and politician Thomas B Peddie\n(1808\n-\n1889)\n, who gave the school a $\n25\n,\n000\ngift. When Ely began teaching there the principal was Hiram Alden Pratt but he left in\n1875\nand LaRoy Griffin became principal. Ely remained at the Peddie Institute until June\n1876\n. She was appointed to teach in the Normal College, New York City, and began teaching there on\n20\nSeptember\n1876\n[\n8\n]\n:-\nIn\n1847\n, the New York State Legislature created the Free Academy to provide post-grade school education for boys, but no such school for girls yet existed. On\n17\nNovember\n1869\n, a newly established Board of Education passed a resolution creating the Female Normal and High School, which would train women to become teachers and provide high school and college level courses. In\n1870\n, the school's name changed to \"The Normal College of the City of New York.\" The goal of this institution was to provide free higher education to women. Thomas Hunter, a former principal, became the school's first president; he insisted on admitting students of all racial and ethnic backgrounds and teaching a combined curriculum of liberal arts, science, and education.\nIn\n1914\nThe Normal College of the City of New York was renamed Hunter College, in honour of Thomas Hunter.\nAt the time of the\n1880\nU.S. Census, Achsah Ely was living at Manalapan, Monmouth, New Jersey, with her parents and her two sisters Ann and Kate. Her occupation is given as \"teaching school\" while her sisters had no occupation listed. During her time at the Normal College of the City of New York, Ely was given leave to undertake graduate work at Newnham College, Cambridge, England, and then at Chicago University which accepted women from\n1872\n.\nIn\n1887\nEly was elected head of the Department of Mathematics at Vassar College, where she remained until her death in December\n1904\n. On\n1\nMay\n1891\nEly joined the\nNew York Mathematical Society\n, joining on the same day as\nCharlotte Scott\n. They were the only two women members of the Society in the\n1\nMay\n1891\nlist of members.\nIn the Vassar College Catalogue\n1894\n-\n95\n, Ely explained the mission of the Mathematics Department at Vassar College\n[\n10\n]\n:-\nThe aim in all courses is to cultivate habits of exact, sustained and independent reasoning, of precision and clearness in the statement of convictions and the reasons upon which they depend; to rely upon insight, originality and judgment rather than on memory. The endeavour is to secure full possession of leading principles and methods rather than of details. From the first, students who show special aptitude are encouraged in the working of subjects, which require more prolonged investigation than the daily exercise of the classroom.\nJohn McCleary, in the excellent article\n[\n4\n]\n, gives a good account of Ely's contributions to Vassar College in her role as Head of Mathematics:-\nEly had a strong interest in expanding the offerings of the Mathematics Department, to provide the \"elastic character of the curriculum of the college\" with \"modern mathematical thought.\" Students were studying solid analytic geometry for which visualisation of algebraic surfaces is an important skill to acquire. She obtained funds to buy the plaster-of-Paris models manufactured by\nBrill\nand Schilling in Darmstadt ... .\nAlthough she did not have a doctorate in mathematics, Achsah Ely was thoroughly engaged in the subject, even at the international level. She attended the second International Congress of Mathematicians held in Paris in the summer of\n1900\n, one of seven women among the\n250\nor so participants listed in the proceedings.\nUnder the leadership of Ely, the first PhD in mathematics was hired into the department.\nRuth Gentry\nobtained the first PhD awarded to a woman by Bryn Mawr College in\n1896\n, having studied in Berlin and in Paris before taking a position at Vassar in\n1894\nwhere she taught until\n1902\n. Around this time the college offered opportunities for graduate study, which included advanced courses on projective geometry, differential equations, and modern methods of analytics. Seniors studied advanced integral calculus, the quaternions, and analytic mechanics.\nAchsah Ely had been an active member of the Alumnae Association of Vassar College from its earliest beginnings, and in\n1871\n-\n1872\nshe had served as chairman of its first committee to secure alumnae representation on the Board of Trustees. From February\n1885\nto\n1890\n, she was chairman of the committee which secured the money and built the college gymnasium. This was later named Ely Hall in her honour. She served as an officer of both the A. C. A. and the Vassar Associations, having been the president of the Vassar Association from\n1894\nto\n1896\n.\nOn\n13\nDecember\n1904\n, Ely was working on the Vassar College campus. As she walked across the campus she suffered a fatal heart attack. She was buried in Old Tennent Churchyard, Tennent, Monmouth County, New Jersey. We note that, although all records give her year of birth as\n1845\n, her tombstone gives\n1846\n. A Memorial Service was held for Ely in\n1905\nand at that service,\nMary Watson Whitney\ngave an address. Like Ely,\nMary Whitney\nhad been in the first class of students at Vassar College. She said\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nMiss Ely and I came together to this place, to begin our collegiate course. ... The College was an experiment - it was not wholly a college. Many people did not believe in it at all; some within its own walls doubted if it could pass the experimental stage and result in any essential degree unlike the many seminaries and academies that then represented the finishing stage of a girl's education. ... In this small group of college students of that early day there was no other more earnest and eager and hopeful than Miss Ely. She was imbued with ambition for the successful working of the experiment.\nIn\n[\n1\n]\nthe Vassar College memorial minute for Achsah Ely is quoted:-\nIn the words of the president of Vassar College, \"She became an inspiration to many students to pursue a life of study. She has gone, but she has left a heritage full of encouragement, a lesson to all of you who are in the college to-day.\"",
