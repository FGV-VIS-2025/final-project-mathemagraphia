  "biografia": "Xiong Qinglai\n(\nalso known as King-Lai Hiong\n)\nwas the son of Xiong Guodong, who worked for the Zhaozhou government. As a hobby, Xiong Guodong was interested in calligraphy and painting. We have given Xiong Qinglai's date of birth according to the Georgian calendar as\n20\nOctober\n1893\nbut it was\n11\nNinth Month\n1893\n, the year of the snake, in the Chinese lunar calendar. In\n1907\n, Xiong Qinglai came to Kunming with his father, and was admitted to Yunnan Higher School for preparatory studies. The courses mainly included Chinese, mathematics, natural sciences, and foreign languages. Two years later he studied English and French in Yunnan. In\n1911\n, he entered the Yunnan Provincial Institute of Higher Learning\n[\n17\n]\n:-\nAt that time, the Manchu Qing Dynasty was in decline, and anti-Qing struggles were surging in various places. Resistance to taxes led to school strikes, market strikes, and mutiny spread all over the country, and the Qing government was caught in a precarious situation.Â Xiong Qinglai was given a demerit by the school for participating in the anti-fascist and anti-Qing demonstrations to \"take back the mining rights\".Â The life people led and the struggle they had, made Xiong Qinglai realise that: To make the country prosperous and strong, it is necessary to master science, and science can strengthen the country and enrich the people.\nWhile still at school, when sixteen years old, following his parents instructions, he married Jiang Juyuan, the daughter of a teacher from his hometown. Jiang Juyuan was also sixteen years old; in fact she was born on\n18\nOctober\n1893\n, two days before Xiong Qinglai. A family custom was to celebrate both their birthdays on\n19\nOctober each year. The most famous of their children was Xiong Bingming\n(1922\n-\n2002)\n, also known as Hsiung Ping-Ming. He was born in Nanjing, China, and was admitted to the University of Paris in\n1947\nto study for a PhD in philosophy. He then entered the School of Fine Arts to study stone sculpture. He is the author of the article\n[\n6\n]\nabout his father.\nIn\n1913\n, the Yunnan provincial government decided to select a group of outstanding young students to study in Europe or in the United States. Xiong Qinglai immediately applied for the examinations. He achieved third place and was admitted as a public-funded student to study mining in a Belgium college. He travelled to Belgium and in the autumn of\n1913\nbegan his studies there. On\n4\nAugust\n1914\nGermany declared war on Belgium, despite Belgium declaring itself neutral, and German troops entered the country. Xiong Qinglai decided to seek safety in France and he journeyed there going first to the Netherlands, then to the United Kingdom before finally reaching France. He contracted a serious lung disease on the journey but, after he recovered, he was able to enter the LycÃ©e St Louis in Paris where he studied mathematics.\nAfter graduating from the LycÃ©e St Louis in\n1915\n, Xiong Qinglai began his undergraduate studies later that year at the University of Grenoble. He moved from Grenoble to Paris where he continued his studies of mathematics, analytical mechanics, physics and astronomy at the Faculty of Science in Paris, then going to the University of Montpellier, and finally to the University of Marseille. He was awarded a Master of Science degree by the University of Montpellier in\n1920\n. In the spring of\n1921\n, Xiong Qing returned to Kunming in China where he taught at the Kunming Yunnan Industrial School and the Yunnan Road School.\nThe Sanjiang Normal School had been established in\n1902\nand became Liangjiang Normal School in\n1905\n, then Nanjing Higher Normal School in\n1914\n. It obtained university status as the National Southeastern University in\n1920\nbut the Nanjing Higher Normal School continued to operate until\n1923\n. This move to university status was accomplished by Kuo Ping-Wen\n(\nsometime written as Guo Bingwen\n)\n(1880\n-\n1969)\nwho was president of Nanjing Higher Normal School from\n1919\n-\n23\n, becoming the first president of the National Southeastern University in\n1921\n. Kuo Ping-Wen invited Xiong Qinglai to become a professor of mathematics at the National Southeastern University, and to establish a Department of Mathematics there. Xiong Qinglai went with his wife and son to Nanjing in September\n1921\nand began teaching at the National Southeast University and also at Nanjing Higher Normal School. In\n[\n17\n]\nan episode is related which tells us much about Xiong Qinglai's character:-\nAs early as\n1921\n, when he was a professor at the Southeast University, he discovered that a student named Liu Guang was very talented, and he often instructed him how to study and undertake research. Later, with a professor who had taught Liu Guang, he co-sponsored Liu Guang, who was from a poor family, to study abroad, and regularly sent him living expenses. Once, Xiong Qinglai even sold the leather robe he was wearing to send money to Liu Guang. After Liu Guang became a famous physicist, he often mentioned this past event with affection. He said: \"I heard about the professor selling leather robes for me ten years ago. At that time, I was moved to tears. What happened to me is unforgettable and will never be forgotten. How caring, how passionate and loving he was for our generation!\".\nIn the autumn of\n1925\n, Xiong Qinglai taught at Northwestern University for one semester, and after that he returned to Southeast University in the spring semester of the following year. In the autumn of\n1926\n, he was invited to go north as a professor at Tsinghua University in northwest Beijing. This university had been established as Tsing Hua Imperial College in\n1911\n, and renamed Tsing Hua College in the following year. In\n1925\na university section was established at the College and the name National Tsing Hua University was adopted in\n1928\n.Â The president of Tsinghua College, Cao Yunxiang, on the advice of the Dean of Science Ye Qisun, invited Xiong Qinglai to join the mathematics department which, at that time, was headed by Zheng Tongsun. Xiong Qinglai was given advanced courses to teach on calculus, differential equations, and analytical functions. In\n1928\nhe took over as the head of the Department of Mathematics from Zheng Tongsun. In\n1930\nhe replaced Ye Qisun at the Dean of Science.\nHua Loo-Keng\nattended middle school at the Chinese Vocational College in Shanghai but his family were unable to continue paying fees so he left before completing his final year. He then suffered from typhoid fever and was in bed for six months. Although he never attended university, he studied mathematics on his own and began to write papers.\nSome Researches on the Theorem of Sturm\n, appeared in the December\n1929\nand in\n1930\nhe published a short note showing the error in a\n1926\npaper claiming to prove that the quintic could be solved by radicals. In\n1931\nXiong Qinglai read\nHua Loo-Keng\n's paper in the Shanghai Journal of Science and saw at once that the article was clear, well-argued, and concise. He asked his colleagues if they knew at which university\nHua Loo-Keng\nwas a professor. When he discovered that\nHua Loo-Keng\nhad never had a university education and was working as a secretary in Jintan Middle School he invited him to Tsinghua University where he worked as an assistant in the library and, at the same time, studied undergraduate courses.\nHua Loo-Keng\nbecame an assistant in mathematics and in\n1934\nwas promoted to lecturer. He spent the two years\n1936\n-\n38\nat Cambridge, England, at the invitation of\nG H Hardy\nand, thanks to Xiong Qinglai, became a mathematician of high international standing.\nXiong Qinglai attended the International Congress of Mathematicians in Zurich Switzerland in September\n1932\n, then went to Paris to spend a year undertaking research and had two papers published in\n1933\n, namely\nSur les fonctions mÃ©romorphes dans le cercle-unite\nâ\n(\nOn meromorphic functions in the unit circle\n)\n, and\nSur les fonctions mÃ©romorphes d'ordre infini\nâ\n(\nOn meromorphic functions of infinite order\n)\n. In Paris he was advised by\nGeorges Valiron\nand his research went so well that he took leave of absence from Tsinghua University for\n1933\n-\n34\nand at the end of this second year submitted the thesis\nSur les fonctions entiÃ¨res et les fonctions mÃ©romorphes d'ordre infini\nâ\n(\nOn integer functions and meromorphic functions of infinite order.\n)\n. It was examined by\nE Borel\n(\nPresident\n)\n,\nA Denjoy\nand\nG Valiron\nand approved on\n29\nJune\n1934\n. At the end of the Introduction he wrote:-\nIt remains for me, to end this introduction, to express all the gratitude I have contracted towards MM\nBorel\nand\nHadamard\n. I particularly thank M\nValiron\nwho suggested this work to me and whose indications and criticisms were very precious to me, and M\nDenjoy\nwho was also good enough to give me advice. Allow me once again to express my sincere gratitude to MM H Villat,\nP Montel\nand\nP Humbert\n. Nor can I forget those who helped me and made my stay in Paris possible.\nFor further information about this thesis, see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nIn\n1934\n, Xiong Qinglai returned to Beijing and continued to serve as a professor and head of the Department of Mathematics at Tsinghua University.Â In July\n1935\n, the\nChinese Mathematical Society\nwas established in Shanghai, with Xiong Qinglai as one of the founders and a member of the first board of directors.\nIn July\n1937\nthe Second Chino-Japanese war broke out and the Japanese army soon took control of Beijing. Xiong Qinglai was offered the role of president of Yunnan University in Kunming and he accepted. Yunnan University had been founded in\n1922\nas the Private University of Donglu and officially opened in April\n1923\n. It became the Provincial University of Donglu in\n1930\n, then renamed as the Provincial University of Yunnan in September\n1934\n. When Xiong Qinglai took up the role of President in\n1937\nthe university only had a School of Arts with departments of liberal arts and education, a School of Science and Technology with a department of engineering and a department of science, and a Special training course in medicine. There were\n39\nprofessors,\n8\nlecturers, and\n302\nstudents. The teaching equipment was poor and the teaching quality was not high. Under Xiong Qinglai rapid improvements took place, with the university becoming the National University of Yunnan in\n1938\n. Over the next few years the university grew to have five schools with\n18\ndepartments, three special training courses,Â and three laboratories. Xiong Qinglai was able to bring outstanding scholars to the university and in this he was aided by academics finding safety in Kunming, when forced to flee from the areas where the Chino-Japanese war was being fought\n[\n10\n]\n:-\nIn\n1939\n, Xiong Qinglai founded the High School affiliated to Yunnan University; he also continuously enriched the teaching equipment and books, so that the library had a collection of more than\n100\n,\n000\nvolumes. Each department of science had relatively complete laboratories, the Medical School has an affiliated hospital and an autopsy room, the Agricultural College had an experimental farm, the Mathematics Department established an astronomical observatory on Fenghuang Mountain in the eastern suburbs, the Engineering College had an internship factory, and the Aviation Department had three planes, which was rare among colleges and universities in the country; he also wrote the \"Yunnan University School Song\" himself and formulated the school motto of \"honesty, integrity, sensitivity and perseverance\", requiring every student to be honest, upright, intelligent and persevere in learning.\nIn\n1948\n, as a result of the Chinese Civil War, Xiong Qinglai ceased to be president of Yunnan University. In March\n1949\n, the Department of Education ordered him to attend the UNESCO conference held in Paris and he stayed in France to engage in mathematical research. He no longer had any main source of remuneration and was not recognised by the Chinese regime. His wife remained in China, so this added to his problems. Despite life in Paris being difficult, he published\nSur une extension du second thÃ©orÃ¨me fondamental de R Nevanlinna\nâ\n(\nOn an extension of the second fundamental theorem of R Nevanlinna\n)\n(1950)\nand\nSur les fonctions mÃ©romorphes et leurs dÃ©rivÃ©es\nâ\n(\nOn meromorphic functions and their derivatives\n)\n(1950)\nbut, in\n1950\n, he suffered from a cerebral haemorrhage, which led to a paralysis of the right side of his body. Xiong Qinglai struggled with the disease with amazing perseverance, practicing every day writing with his left hand. After one year, he was able to write as well with his left hand as he had before with his right. He was greatly helped in his recovery by his friends and his health slowly improved. By\n1953\n, at the age of sixty, he was producing a remarkable research output having twelve papers publishing in\n1953\n-\n55\n. For the titles of these papers, see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nIn\n1957\nXiong Qinglai published a book,\nSur les fonctions mÃ©romorphes et les fonctions algÃ©broÃ¯des, extensions d'un thÃ©orÃ¨me de M R Nevanlinna\nâ\n(\nOn meromorphic functions and algebraic functions, extensions of a theorem of M R Nevanlinna\n)\n. He had been asked to write this work by Henri Villat\n(1879\n-\n1972)\n, the professor of fluid mechanics at the University of Paris, to include in his series of works\nMÃ©morial des Sciences MathÃ©matiques\nâ\n(\nMemorial of Mathematical Sciences\n)\n. You can read an extract from the Introduction and an extract from the review\n[\n2\n]\nat\nTHIS LINK\n.\nWhile Xiong Qinglai was in Paris major changes took place in China. In September\n1954\nthe National People's Congress in Beijing unanimously approved the\n1954\nConstitution of the People's Republic of China. Taiwan, which had been under Japanese rule until\n1945\n, became Chinese but was not controlled by the People's Republic of China when it formed in\n1954\n. Chen Lifu\n(1900\n-\n2001)\n, who had been Minister of Education in China from\n1938\n, had relocated to Taiwan in\n1949\nbut moved to the United States in\n1950\n. In\n1956\n, while on a visit to France, he went to Xiong Qinglai's Paris residence and tried to persuade him to go to Taiwan as head of a university attached to the Taiwan Institute of Atomic Energy. Xiong Qinglai thanked him for the offer but categorically refused. Around the same time,\nHua Loo-Keng\nsent a letter to convey that Premier Zhou Enlai, the first Premier of the People's Republic of China serving from October\n1949\n, had invited him to return to the People's Republic of China to participate in socialist construction. Xiong Qinglai accepted and returned to Beijing in June\n1957\n. He said\n[\n10\n]\n:-\nI would like to devote myself to the academic construction of the motherland in the light of socialism.\nBack in China he worked at the Institute of Mathematics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. He had over\n20\npapers published over the following eight years\n[\n8\n]\n:-\nAt the same time, he recruited graduate students, instructed young scholars, advocated and participated in academic exchange activities, and from\n1961\nto\n1964\nattended national or Beijing function theory conferences every year and gave academic lectures.Â During this period, he also hosted a seminar on function theory in the Beijing area at his home, once every two weeks.\nHis last years, however, were very difficult. The Cultural Revolution had been launched by Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party, in\n1966\nwith the aim of ending any opposition to Communism. Xiong Qinglai was labelled a \"reactionary academic authority\" by the Cultural Revolution\n[\n17\n]\n:-\nAccording to Xiong Qinglai's granddaughter Xiong Youde: \"One of my grandpa's students was the leader of the 'rebel party' squad. My grandma accompanied my grandpa to the denunciation meeting. The slogan at the meeting was to criticise 'Xiong Hua's black line'.\nHua Loo-Keng\nstood up but, at the beginning, grandpa sat and listened to people fighting against\nHua Loo-Keng\n. Later, when they shouted 'bring Xiong Qinglai up', grandpa went up tremblingly, unable to stand still. Someone kindly brought him a chair, but he didn't sit.\nHua Loo-Keng\ncame to support him, but he couldn't stand still, so grandma went up to support grandpa. Suddenly, a 'rebel' came up and took off the Chairman Mao badge on Grandpa's chest.Â Grandpa looked at the familiar and unfamiliar faces around him, and felt a dull pain. Could it be that he had returned to his motherland for this desperate reason? Grandma told me ...: 'Everyone shouted down your grandfather, only Yang Le hid in the back and didn't say a word, perhaps Yang Le had a conscience'.\"\nXiong Qinglai died on\n3\nFebruary\n1969\nat the age of\n76\n. After approval had been sought, his body was sent to the crematorium.\nHua Loo-Keng\nsent a request to the Revolutionary Committee to allow him to visit the crematorium, which was approved. There he found Xiong Qinglai's body among piles of corpses.\nHua Loo-Keng\n, when later talking to Xiong Qinglai's granddaughter Xiong Youde, said\n[\n17\n]\n:-\nI didn't expect your grandfather, the famous mathematician back then, to die so tragically. Lying in the middle of a pile of corpses, there was no wreath for him and no memorial service.\nThe Cultural Revolution came to an end with Mao Zedong's death in\n1976\nand, beginning in\n1978\n, those 'unjustly, falsely, or erroneously' persecuted during the Cultural Revolution were rehabilitated. Xiong Qinglai's name was among the first to be rehabilitated in\n1978\n. On\n20\nNovember\n1992\nChina issued the\n3\nrd series of 'Modern Chinese Scientists' stamps. The first of the four stamps in the series, with a value of\n20\nfen, was to honour Xiong Qinglai. See\nTHIS LINK\n.\nOther honours given to Xiong Qinglai was the setting up of the Xiong Qinglai Scholarship at Yunnan University\n[\n11\n]\n:-\nThe scholarship was proposed in\n1989\nby Jiang Juyuan, wife of Xiong Qinglai\n(1893\n-\n1969)\n, the noted mathematician and educator and Yunnan University's deceased president, toÂ commemorate the latter, carry forward his devotion to scientific research, and inspire the students to develop their abilities in an all-round way.\nAmong other honours, his former residence is preserved and open to the public. It was given the status of a national key cultural relic by the State Council in May\n2013\n[\n5\n]\n:-\nThe former residence of Xiong Qinglai was built in the late Qing Dynasty. It covers an area of\n1055\nsquare meters. It sits on the west and faces the east. The door opens to the north, with a screen in front of the door, and a plaque with the inscription \"Xiong Qinglai's Former Residence\" hangs on the door. The whole building is irregularly framed according to the terrain, just like the \"infinite function\" defined by Xiong Qinglai, which is fascinating.\nThis is in the village of his birth, originally Xizai Village, renamed Qinglai Village with the approval of the County People's Government in\n1998\n. There is a \"Qinglai Middle School\" named after him in Mile County, Yunnan Province.\nWe end with this tribute from\n[\n15\n]\n:-\nHis life-long work, almost all his life and energy spent on China's scientific research and education, has personally created the three major universities in modern China\n(\nNational Southeast University, National Tsinghua University, National Yunnan University\n)\n, cultivate a large number of outstanding talents and improve the influence of Chinese mathematics in the world.",
