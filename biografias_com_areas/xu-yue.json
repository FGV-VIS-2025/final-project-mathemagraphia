  "biografia": "We know a little of\nXu Yue\nbut the main text which bears his name, the\nShushu jiyi\n(\nNotes on Traditions of Arithmetic Methods\n)\n, is probably the work of a later author trying to claim a certain respectability for his writings.\nXu Yue was a pupil of\nLiu Hong\nand he studied mathematics under the famous calendar expert.\nLiu Hong\nworked at the Imperial Observatory and it was there that Xu Yue held discussions with him and also with the head of the Astronomical Bureau. Mathematics was used by\nLiu Hong\nand others at the Observatory in their studies of astronomy and the related work on the calendar which, of course, was based on the apparent motion of the sun and the moon. It was natural, therefore that Xu Yue would gain expertise from these men in astronomy and calendar science.\nIt is reported that Xu Yue wrote a commentary on the\nNine Chapters on the Mathematical Art\n. This preceded the major commentary written by\nLiu Hui\nin the second half of the third century, and it would appear that\nLiu Hui\ncommented on a version of the text which did not include Xu Yue's comments. As a result Xu Yue's commentary has not come down to us.\nWhether Xu Yue wrote the\nShushu jiyi\n(\nNotes on Traditions of Arithmetic Methods\n)\nis uncertain. It is a rather strange work filled with ideas from Buddhism and from Taoism and describes arithmetical systems intermingled with religious nuances. The version which has come down to us today has a commentary by Zhen Luan written around\n566\n, but that does little to help understand the difficulties in the text.\nFourteen old methods of calculation are mentioned in the text. One of these uses a device resembling the abacus called ball-arithmetic. Three others also uses balls, one involving balls in columns, one involving two balls of different colours which move at right angles to each other suggesting almost the idea of Cartesian coordinates. Needham writes in\n[\n4\n]\nthat Xu Yue:-\n... shows an interesting appreciation of coordinate relationships.\nUnfortunately there is no great clarity in the descriptions.\nThere is no doubt that one of the main aims of the text is to introduce a notation which will allow the representation of large numbers. Most historians believe that the aim of the author was to suggest that it was possible to represent any number, no matter how large. Three systems of powers of\n10\nare given. The lower system is based on the sequence of powers of\n10\n10\n,\n1\n0\n2\n,\n1\n0\n3\n,\n1\n0\n4\n,\n1\n0\n5\n,\n.\n.\n.\n10, 10^{2}, 10^{3}, 10^{4}, 10^{5}, ...\n1\n0\n,\n1\n0\n2\n,\n1\n0\n3\n,\n1\n0\n4\n,\n1\n0\n5\n,\n.\n.\n.\nthe middle system on powers of\n1\n0\n4\n10^{4}\n1\n0\n4\n1\n0\n4\n,\n1\n0\n8\n,\n1\n0\n12\n,\n1\n0\n16\n,\n.\n.\n.\n10^{4}, 10^{8}, 10^{12}, 10^{16}, ...\n1\n0\n4\n,\n1\n0\n8\n,\n1\n0\n1\n2\n,\n1\n0\n1\n6\n,\n.\n.\n.\nthe upper system being based on powers of\n10\n, each being the square of its predecessor\n1\n0\n4\n,\n1\n0\n8\n,\n1\n0\n16\n,\n1\n0\n32\n,\n.\n.\n.\n10^{4}, 10^{8}, 10^{16}, 10^{32}, ...\n1\n0\n4\n,\n1\n0\n8\n,\n1\n0\n1\n6\n,\n1\n0\n3\n2\n,\n.\n.\n.\nFinally, Xu Yue talks about calculations of the nine balls. Again what is intended here is unclear, but the commentator Zhen Luan is in no doubt that this refers to a\n3\nby\n3\nmagic square\n.\nDespite being an obscure text, after editing by\nLi Chunfeng\n, the\nShushu jiyi\n(\nNotes on Traditions of Arithmetic Methods\n)\nwas selected as a text for the Imperial examinations in\n656\nand became one of\nThe Ten Classics\nin\n1084\n.",
