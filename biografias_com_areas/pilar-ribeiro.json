  "biografia": "Pilar Ribeiro\nwas the daughter of Joaquim Rodrigues Carreira and LuÃ­sa Loureiro Peres. Let us note at this point that although Pilar Ribeiro is always known by that name, in fact Ribeiro is her married name. She was a student at the Maria AmÃ¡lia Vaz de Carvalho high school in Lisbon. This secondary school, founded in\n1885\nwith the aim of \"the emancipation of women through education,\" was the first high school for girls in Portugal. Pilar graduated from the high school in\n1929\nand in the same year began her studies of mathematics at the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Lisbon.\nAt the University of Lisbon, Pilar met a brilliant mathematics student, Hugo Baptista Ribeiro\n(1910\n-\n1988)\nwho had been born in Lisbon on\n16\nMay\n1910\nto parents Mario Baptista Ribeiro and EmÃ­lia Baptista Ribeiro. Pilar and Hugo shared strong anti-fascist views at a time when the country had become, in\n1933\n, a right-wing dictatorship run by the Estado Novo which banned trade unions, controlled the media with strict censorship and created a Political Police to arrest political opponents. Pilar graduated from the University of Lisbon in\n1933\n, and in the following year she married Hugo Ribeiro.\nAfter graduating, Pilar Ribeiro served an internship to qualify as a mathematics teacher. This she served in the\nPedro Nunes\nLiceu Normal de Lisboa, a school named for the Portuguese mathematician\nPedro Nunes\n(1502\n-\n1578)\n.This school had been founded in\n1906\nand, in\n1930\n, it had been classified as a normal high school, with the mission to support teacher training. After the internship, Pilar Ribeiro was appointed to teach mathematics at the Secondary School LuÃ­s de CamÃµes. This school, founded in\n1902\n, was named for the Portuguese poet LuÃ­s de CamÃµes and became one of the largest and most prestigious secondary schools in Lisbon. Ribeiro continued to study mathematics, attending the Analysis Seminar at the University of Lisbon, organised by AntÃ³nio Aniceto Monteiro\n(1907\n-\n1980)\n. Monteiro had been an undergraduate at the University of Lisbon, then had undertaken research for his Ph.D. at the Sorbonne advised by\nMaurice FrÃ©chet\n. He was awarded his doctorate from the University of Paris in\n1936\nfor his thesis\nSur l'additivitÃ© des noyaux de Fredholm\nâ\n(\nOn the additivity of Fredholm kernels\n)\n, then returned to teach at the University of Lisbon. During this period, Pilar Ribeiro's husband, Hugo Ribeiro continued to study mathematics at the University of Lisbon, but also took part in youth association activities and gave private lessons.\nIn addition to her mathematical activities, Pilar Ribeiro was active politically. With her husband she attended the Congress of the Socialist Youth of Spain in\n1934\nand she joined the Portuguese Women's Association for Peace founded in Lisbon on\n11\nNovember\n1935\n. This Association was concerned about:-\n... constant threats that hover over the world and startle the hearts of all women, women - wives, mothers, daughters, sisters and brides - who would have to regret, once again, the fate of their loved ones.\nThis political activity made the Ribeiros a target for the Political Police and at one point Hugo was arrested for taking part in the activities of Socorro Vermelho Internacional, the International Workers Aid Society set up to support political prisoners. He was forced into exile in Spain but, after a period, was able to return to Portugal.\nPilar Ribeiro is perhaps best known today for her work as a founder member of the\nPortuguese Mathematical Society\n(\nSociedade Portuguesa de MatemÃ¡tica\n)\n. Setting up any Society in Portugal at this time was almost impossible due to the political situation. Political parties were banned and the government used censorship, propaganda, and political imprisonment in running the country. Many mathematicians, believing in the importance of scientific knowledge and education, felt that these ends could only be achieved through democratic means. It was also a time when mathematics was flourishing in Portugal. The first moves were the founding of the journalÂ\nPortugaliae MathematicaÂ\nin\n1937\n, the Mathematical Seminar in Lisbon in\n1938\n, and the journalÂ\nGazeta de MatemÃ¡tica\nÂ in\n1939\nof which Pilar Ribeiro was a co-founder. On\n12\nDecember\n1940\n, the\nPortuguese Mathematical Society\nwas founded with Pilar Ribeiro as one of the founding members, in fact member number\n1\n. The first committee elected to run the Society consisted of Pedro JosÃ© da Cunha\n(\nPresident\n)\n, Victor Hugo Duarte Lemos\n(\nVice President\n)\n, AntÃ³nio Aniceto Monteiro\n(\nGeneral Secretary\n)\n, Manuel Zaluar Nunes\n(\nTreasurer\n)\n, Maria Pilar Baptista Ribeiro\n(\nFirst Secretary\n)\nand Augusto SÃ¡ da Costa\n(\nSecond Secretary\n)\n. Pilar Ribeiro continued as First Secretary for\n1940\n-\n41\nand was very active in promoting the new Society. We should note, however, that Portuguese regime did not allow the Society to be officially registered so it effectively operated as an illegal organisation until the overthrow of the authoritarian regime of Estado Novo in\n1974\n.\nHugo Ribeiro obtained a scholarship from the Institute for High Culture which supported him to undertake research at the EidgenÃ¶ssische Technische Hochschule in Zurich for his Ph.D. Pilar Ribeiro went to Zurich with her husband in\n1942\nand attended advanced mathematics courses at the EidgenÃ¶ssische Technische Hochschule. She sent back three papers\n[\n8\n]\n,\n[\n9\n]\n,\n[\n10\n]\nin\n1942\n-\n43\nfor publication the\nGazeta de MatemÃ¡tica\n, entitled\nAbout teaching Mathematics in Switzerland\n. The first begins\n(\nwe have translated the Portuguese text to English\n)\n[\n8\n]\n:-\nThe Federal Polytechnic School E.T.H., seeks, as a technical school, mainly in recent years, especially through its courses and exercises relating to applied sciences, to develop the sense of adapting theoretical knowledge to the demands of industrial life. In addition, it seeks, in the contact between teachers and students, whether in exercise classes, colloquiums or seminars, to prepare them for independent work, which will gradually take the form of research work.\nLater in this first paper, she describes in detail the structure of the mathematical courses. Here is a short extract\n[\n8\n]\n:-\nAt the School of Mathematics and Physics, teaching is organised in order to prepare not only secondary school teachers, but also actuaries and physicists for industry. The study plans comprise eight semesters.\nThe first four semesters are dedicated to having students acquire an indispensable technique with calculus. The exercises get students used to working on their own by developing their initiative. They move from concrete problems, in seminars, to broader issues and to the study and discussion of recent research. This last mentioned work takes place in the last four semesters in which students are free to choose their direction, which allows them to orient their interest in this or that branch of Mathematics or Physics. The purpose of the Mathematics Seminar is to initiate students into mathematical thinking and personal inquiry. It seeks to achieve this end through student presentations of mathematics memoirs, problem solving and discussion with teachers.\nIn\n1945\nshe published the paper\nNews about teaching Mathematics in Zurich\nin the\nGazeta de MatemÃ¡tica.\nIt begins\n[\n11\n]\n:-\nAlready in articles in 'Gazeta de MatemÃ¡tica' I gave information about some aspects of the teaching of Mathematics at the Federal Polytechnic School of ZÃ¼rich. Now, after having regularly attended lessons in Mathematics and Descriptive Geometry at a secondary school, the Oberrealscbule in ZÃ¼rich, I find it useful to communicate some results of my first observations.\nHugo Ribeiro undertook research for his Ph.D. in Zurich advised by\nPaul Bernays\nand\nHeinz Hopf\nand was awarded the degree for his thesis\nLattices des groupes abeliens finis\nâ\n(\nLattices of finite abelian groups\n)\n. His scholarship was ended by the Institute for High Culture before he had completed his studies, and Pilar worked at the Oberrealscbule in Zurich to support them. In\n1946\nPilar Ribeiro and her husband returned to Lisbon and she was elected again to fill the position of First Secretary of the\nPortuguese Mathematical Society\nserving for the session\n1946\n-\n47\n. Hugo Ribeiro was General Secretary of the Society for the same session.\nAntÃ³nio de Oliveira Salazar had been Prime Minister of Portugal from\n1932\nand he had reorganised his Political Police in\n1945\nas the International Police for the Defence of the State. By\n1947\nHugo Ribeiro's position as an academic and well-known active opponent of Salazar's regime put him in serious danger and Hugo and Pilar Ribeiro were forced into exile. They arrived in the United States on\n6\nOctober\n1947\nand travelled to the University of California at Berkeley where Hugo taught as a visiting professor from\n1947\nto\n1949\n. While still in California, on\n25\nMay\n1950\n, Pilar made an application for American naturalisation. She worked on a translation of\nDavid Hilbert\n's\nGrundlagen der Geometrie\nâ\n(\nFundamentals of Geometry\n)\n(1899)\ninto Portuguese. It was published as\nFundamentos da Geometria\nâ\n(\nFundamentals of Geometry\n)\n(1951)\nwith Maria do Pilar Ribeiro and JosÃ© da Silva Paulo as co-translators. They write:-\nThe translators are hopeful that a careful study of the various problems in this book will indirectly contribute to implanting the idea that, in general, the poor quality of geometry teaching in our schools is only superficially due to pedagogical deficiencies, but rather they find themselves believing it is due to the subject being taught with a lack of contact with living current problems, and the indispensable training for the investigation of these problems.\nHugo and Pilar Ribeiro went to Brazil in June\n1960\n, travelling to the Federal University of Pernambuco at Recife. While in Brazil they met the Portuguese mathematician JosÃ© Cardoso Morgado\n(1917\n-\n2003)\nand his wife Maria Helena. Morgado and his wife had both been persecuted, and arrested for political reasons in Portugal. In\n1947\nMorgado had been removed from his teaching position in Lisbon and had survived by giving private mathematics lessons until he, together with Maria Helena de Vinha Novais whom he married in\n1955\n, went to Brazil in June\n1960\n.\nIn September\n1960\n, Pilar and her husband left Brazil and returned to the United States travelling to Lincoln, Nebraska where their address was\n1818\nMorningside Drive. Later, in\n1961\n, they moved to Pennsylvania State University, where Hugo was appointed a Professor of Mathematics and Pilar was an Instructor in Mathematics.\nOn\n25\nApril\n1974\nthe Carnation Revolution put an end to the authoritarian regime of Estado Novo in Portugal and Hugo and Pilar Ribeiro were free to return to Portugal. From\n1976\nto\n1980\n, Pilar Ribeiro was a professor at the University of Porto and at its graduate Abel Salazar Biomedical Institute. Hugo Ribeiro, who also taught at the University of Porto, died in\n1988\nand in January\n2005\nPilar donated five boxes of his correspondence to the Biblioteca Nacional de Portugal.\nPilar Ribeiro died when only just over six months short of her\n100\nth birthday. A Portuguese postage stamp featuring her was issued on the centenary of her birth.\nThe following tribute by Penn State University appeared following Pilar Ribeiro's death\n[\n12\n]\n:-\nMrs Maria do Pilar Ribeiro passed away March\n28\n,\n2011\n. She was the widow of Professor Hugo Ribeiro, who was a member of the faculty of the Mathematics Department at Penn Sate from\n1961\nto\n1976\n. Pilar also served as an instructor in the Penn State University Mathematics Department.\nPilar would turn\n100\nyears old on October\n5\n,\n2011\n. She was one of the founders of the Portuguese Mathematical Society, in\n1941\n, holding the member number\n1\n. She was also a co-founder of the Mathematics popularisation journal \"Gazeta de MatemÃ¡tica\", which is still published. Together with her husband and a few others, she was a member of a very dynamic generation that during the war tried to develop Mathematics in Portugal, against the establishment and political persecution. They were all eventually chased by the dictatorial regime that then dominated the country, which was very suspicious of any kind of free thinking. This led the Ribeiros to the United States in the late\n1940\n's, and eventually to Penn State, a place which they loved very much.",
