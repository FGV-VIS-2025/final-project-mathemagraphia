  "biografia": "Georges Darmois\n's parents were Charles Ãmile Darmois\n(1857\n-\n1917)\nand Elizabeth Virginie Dardar\n(1859\n-\n1915)\n, who were both born in Ãply. Georges had an older brother EugÃ¨ne, born in\n1884\n, who went on to study mathematics and physics, becoming a professor of physics. He also has a sister Gabrielle. The small village of Ãply in which he was born is equidistant from Nancy, Metz and Pont Ã  Mousson. Daniel DuguÃ© writes\n[\n7\n]\n(\nsee also\n[\n8\n]\n)\n:-\nHe was what we call \"un homme l'Est.\" Born at the foothills of the Vosges, he liked to explain that his name came from the land of the Armoises, on which his ancestors had laboured and which had been, in the fifteenth century, the home of the false Jeanne d'Arc, Jeanne des Armoises.\nHe excelled at school, studying at the CollÃ¨ge de Toul and then the lycÃ©e in Nancy. In his final year at the lycÃ©e he took the competitive examinations for entry to the Ãcole Polytechnique and the Ãcole Normale SupÃ©rieure and, given his outstanding performance, was offered a place in both. He chose to study at the Ãcole Normale SupÃ©rieure where his brother EugÃ¨ne had already been studying for two years. He began his studies in\n1906\nand graduated with a first degree in mathematics in\n1909\n. He was then given the position of 'AgrÃ©gÃ© prÃ©parateur' which was reserved for the most brilliant students, assisting\nÃmile Borel\nwho was director of the Ãcole Normale SupÃ©rieure. As an undergraduate, he had taken courses given by\nGaston Darboux\nand\nÃdouard Goursat\nand, in\n1911\n, encouraged by\nDarboux\n, he began to undertake research on a topic involving both geometry and analysis. He published four papers between\n1910\nand\n1914\n:\nSur les correspondances Ã  normales concourantes\nâ\n(\nOn the correspondence of intersecting normals\n)\n(1910)\n;\nSur les courbes algÃ©briques Ã  torsion constante\nâ\n(\nOn algebraic curves with constant torsion\n)\n(1913)\n;\nSur les courbes Ã  torsion constante\nâ\n(\nOn the constant torsion curves\n)\n(1914)\n; and\nSur la mÃ©thode de Laplace\nâ\n(\nOn a method of Laplace\n)\n(1914)\n. His thesis was almost complete when World War I broke out in July\n1914\nbut he had to stop work on it to undertake military duty.\nFor his war service, Darmois served in the artillery, in particular being assigned to work on anti-aircraft batteries. Later on he worked for Section\n25\n, under the command of the physicist Gustave Ribaud, on the transmission of sound. He wrote about how this experience changed the direction of his mathematical interests in\n[\n7\n]\n:-\nThe\n1914\n-\n1918\nwar, having oriented me towards ballistics and artillery problems, and then towards location by sound and the problems of measuring and of wave propagation, had deeply inflected my spirit towards mathematical physics and the calculus of probability.\nAfter he had been released from military service, Darmois was appointed as a lecturer at the Faculty of Sciences at Nancy. His interest in the topic of his thesis\nSur les courbes algÃ©briques Ã  torsion constante\nâ\n(\nOn algebraic curves with constant torsion\n)\ndid not carry on after he took his oral examination in\n1921\n. He was promoted to professor at Nancy in\n1921\n, and he became interested in both the theory of relativity and in applications of\nprobability theory\n. He wrote many excellent papers on relativity beginning with\nSur l'intÃ©gration locale des Ã©quations d'Einstein\nâ\n(\nOn the local integration of Einstein's equations\n)\n(1923)\n. These publications include the outstanding memoir\nLes Ãquations de la Gravitation Einsteinienne\nâ\n(\nEinstein's equations of gravity\n)\n(1927)\nand an important book\nLa relativitÃ©\nâ\n(\nRelativity\n)\npublished in\n1932\n. He also published on topics which he had worked on during his military service such as\n(\nwith F Croze\n)\nLa construction de Huygens et la thÃ©orie mÃ©canique de la propogation des ondes\nâ\n(\nThe construction of Huygens and the mechanical theory of propogation of waves\n)\n(1927)\n. Although he continued his interest in relativity, he began to become seriously interested in statistics from around\n1923\n. He wrote\n[\n7\n]\n:-\nThe decision I took in Nancy in\n1923\n, to connect the teaching and investigations of the calculus of probability with several applications to statistics, stemmed from the desire of constituting in France a school of theoretical and practical statistics. Great Britain and the United States showed the way, and it was important to follow their example. I was thus led to participate in national, and later international, statistical activities.\nIn fact in\n1925\nhe began teaching the course on probability and statistics at the Institute of Statistics of the University of Paris. This came about because\nÃmile Borel\n, who had set up the course in\n1923\n, had been elected to the Chamber of Deputies in\n1925\nand looked for someone he could trust to give the course for him. He chose Darmois who, of course, he knew well from working with him before World War I. In\n1928\nDarmois' first publication on statistics appeared being the monograph\nStatistique MathÃ©matique, EncyclopÃ©die scientifique appliquÃ©es\nâ\n(\nMathematical statistics,  Encyclopedia of mathematical applications\n)\nwhich was a published version of the lectures he was giving at the Institute of Statistics of the University of Paris. This was, in fact, the first French textbook on mathematical statistics. Major Greenwood wrote in a review:-\n... this is an excellent treatise to put in the hands of statistical students with a fair grounding in mathematics who are also doing laboratory work. It might also be useful to young mathematicians who wish to have some idea of what statistics is about.\nAt the International Congress of Mathematicians held at Bologna in September\n1928\n, one of the plenary talks was given by\nÃmile Borel\nwho gave the address\nLe calcul des probabilitÃ©s et les sciences exactes.\nDarmois was also an invited speaker at the Congress\n(\nalthough not a plenary speaker\n)\nand he gave the lecture\nSur l'analyse et comparasion des sÃ©ries statistiques qui se dÃ©veloppent dans le temps\nâ\n(\nOn the analysis and comparison of statistical series which could be developed in time\n(\nthe time correlation problem\n)\n)\n. AndrÃ© Danjon writes in\n[\n5\n]\nabout the energetic way that Darmois went about promoting statistics in France:-\nGeorges Darmois set himself two tasks. Firstly, to disseminate the power of statistical methods applied to sciences of observation, to biometrics, to applied psychology, to econometrics, to production control, to\noperational research\n, and so on. The astronomers cannot forget that he was the first in France to teach statistics and stellar dynamics as early as\n1928\n-\n29\n. His apostolic mission for statistics was pursued relentlessly in the form of lectures, conferences, seminars. In some domains, success was instantaneous; George Darmois' ideas, by dint of obstinacy, managed to permeate the least prepared environments and eventually made them prevail against routine. Moreover, he tried to improve those parts of the theory which seemed to deserve special attention. And so he especially cared about the general theories of estimation from random sampling, of which the general theory of errors is a particular case\nDarmois left Nancy in\n1933\nwhen he was appointed to the Faculty of Science in Paris. As well as the Institute of Statistics in Paris, there was also the Institut\nHenri PoincarÃ©\nset up in\n1928\n, with\nBorel\nas its head, to facilitate interactions between researchers in probability and mathematical physics. Darmois had been involved with the Institut from its beginnings, giving lectures there while still on the faculty at Nancy. An announcement for the first session in\n1928\n-\n29\nsays\n[\n4\n]\n:-\nG Darmois, professor at the University of Nancy, will give a series of four lectures on the following topic: Statistical laws, correlation and covariance with applications to heredity, to social and economic sciences.\nThese lectures were published as\nLa mÃ©thode statistique dans les sciences d'observation\nâ\n(\nThe statistical method in the observational sciences\n)\n. Darmois writes in the introduction\n(\nsee\n[\n4\n]\n)\n:-\nThe aim of these lectures is to emphasize several fundamental ideas of statistics and the character of the special order they can bring into some sets of experimental results. A research project usually stems from the desire to verify, deepen and link a group of ideas, either because of its practical importance, or from its unquestionable presence. As observation advances in the field under study, the accumulated results are thus placed either within the framework of a prior theory, sometimes vague, or in a purely pragmatic order, generally with some logical threads running through it. This provisional organization, as a convenient description of the observed material, allows the mind to handle large sets more easily. After that, one looks for what we may generally call persistences, which is to say relations commonly observed which constitute empirical laws for the observed phenomena. ... Once these empirical laws are obtained, the subsequent process of the mind aims at understanding them, explaining them, relating them. In parallel with the descriptive order, the explanatory or logical orders, scientific theories and laws develop. This development, which is constructed from several basic notions, must then recover the results of the experiment.\nThe Institut also had\nMaurice FrÃ©chet\n, who had strong interests in statistics, as a member and it encouraged links with other statisticians. Darmois had always been influenced by\nR A Fisher\n's work in statistics and in\n1934\nFisher\nbegan interacting with those at the Institut\nHenri PoincarÃ©\n. In\n1934\nDarmois published the book\nStatistique et Applications\nâ\n(\nStatistics and applications\n)\nwhich considers applications of statistics to areas such as economics and psychology. In his paper\nDÃ©veloppements rÃ©cents de la technique statistique\nâ\n(\nRecent developments in statistical technique\n)\n(1934)\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nDarmois discusses\nFisher\n's work on estimation - he already knew of\nFisher\n's work in time series analysis and population genetics - yet even so his note in the 'Comptes Rendus'\n(\n'Sur les lois de probabilitÃ© Ã  estimation exhaustive',\nâ\n(\nOn the laws of probability to estimate exhaustive\n)\n(1935)\ncomes as a surprise for it contained an important contribution to\nFisher\n's theory of estimation: Darmois\n(1935)\nconsidered distributions admitting a sufficient statistic, what are now called the exponential, or Koopman-\nPitman\n-Darmois, family of distributions - B O Koopman and\nE J Pitman\nwere based in the United States and Australia respectively and their works appeared somewhat later.\nFisher\n's theory of estimation, which originated in the early\n1920\ns, had attracted some American attention\n(\nHotelling\nand\nDoob\n)\nand Darmois was the first European to contribute to the theory. His next book, or pamphlet, 'L'Emploides Observations Statistiques: MÃ©thodes d'Estimation'\nâ\n(\nEmployment Statistics Observations: Estimation Methods\n)\n(1936)\nexpounded a fresh the theory and Darmois sent\nFisher\na copy. This approach was quite different from\nFrÃ©chet\n's for it was an expression of solidarity and not of veiled criticism.\nFisher\nreplied in June\n1936\nthanking Darmois for his \"excellent little book\" and a brief correspondence on the theory of maximum likelihood ensued.\nThe links between\nFisher\nand the Institut\nHenri PoincarÃ©\ncontinued. Daniel DuguÃ©\n(\nthe author of\n[\n8\n]\nand\n[\n9\n]\n)\nwas a doctoral student of Darmois' and he spent session\n1937\n-\n38\nin London as part of the collaboration.\nFisher\nlectured in Paris in\n1938\nand, in the first half of\n1940\n, Darmois visited London. In June of that year, while he was in London, France capitulated to the German invaders and it was decided that Darmois should not return to France. He stayed in London for some time teaching and undertaking research for the 'Free French'. Later he went to Algiers where he taught and undertook research at the University of Algiers. While there he supervised the writing of two doctoral theses in statistics. Bernard Bru writes\n[\n2\n]\n(\nor\n[\n3\n]\n)\n:-\nThe administrative fiction of Darmois' being held in Britain against his will allowed him to retain his salary, and to pursue his career most honourably. In contrast, his brother EugÃ¨ne\n(1884\n-\n1958)\n, a physicist who was Professor in the FacultÃ© des Sciences de Paris, was accused of being a collaborator after the liberation of France. Suspended from his duties for a time, like\nJulia\nand\nde Broglie\n, he was reinstated \"with a reprimand\" in December\n1944\n.\nAfter the end of World War II, Darmois returned to his post in Paris and was appointed as head of the Institute of Statistics of the University of Paris. He served as President of the\nSociÃ©tÃ© MathÃ©matique de France\nin\n1945\n. In\n1949\nhe succeeded\nFrÃ©chet\nwhen appointed Professor of the Calculus of Probabilities and Mathematical Physics at the Sorbonne. He was President of the International Institute of Statistics from\n1954\nuntil his death, and was elected to the\nAcademy of Sciences\nin\n1955\nin the Astronomy Section.\nAs to Darmois' personality, Bernard Bru writes\n[\n2\n]\n(\nor\n[\n3\n]\n)\n:-\nOn the basis of the opinions of all who knew him, Darmois was an extraordinarily dynamic man, who was open to the influences of both things and people. The number of his pupils and the diversity of subjects in which he guided them bear witness to this. He was gifted with a brilliant vitality, an illuminating intelligence and immense goodwill. Most of this he directed towards the young researchers who came to him from all parts of the world, many of whom continue to recall him with profound gratitude.\nHis former student, Daniel DuguÃ© writes\n[\n8\n]\n:-\nHe was, in French University circles, one of those who most welcomed colleagues from abroad, aided by the smiling amiability of Madame Darmois. How many illustrious statisticians have I met at his home, near the Sorbonne, in the OdÃ©on quarter, where the principals of the French revolution lived ... It is in this harmonious setting that I shall always imagine my master, discussing, with his jovial good-will and deep competence, the latest youthful work that I had come to submit to him for presentation to the 'Comptes Rendus' of the\nAcadÃ©mie des Sciences\n. For he was always passionately concerned with youth and with the efforts of young scientists to extend the scientific patrimony they had received.\nIn\n1964\n, four years after his death,\nCalcul des probabilitÃ©s\nâ\n(\nProbability calculations\n)\nwas published. This book was in two parts:\nVariables alÃ©atoires d'ordre fini\nâ\n(\nRandom variables of finite order\n)\n; and\nThÃ©orie gÃ©nÃ©rale des variables alÃ©atoires quelconques\nâ\n(\nThe general theory of any random variables\n)\n.\nOctav Onicescu\nwrites in a review:-\nThe first part of these lessons shows the common models of probability theory for the case of a finite number of states. ... In the second part the general space of states, constituting a\nBorel\nfield, is considered, with probability defined, as usual, as an additive function of states. Distribution functions, mean values, characteristic functions with their various properties, and moments are presented in a very simple manner. Equally simple is the presentation of pairs of variables with the corresponding\nLaplace\n-\nGauss\nlaw, convergence theorems, domains of attraction of the\nLaplace\n-\nGauss\nlaw, with elements of the theory of errors and the influence of dependence on random quantities. The last section is devoted to linear and parabolic regressions."
