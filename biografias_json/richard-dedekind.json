  "biografia": "Richard Dedekind\n's father was a professor at the Collegium Carolinum in Brunswick. His mother was the daughter of a professor who also worked at the Collegium Carolinum. Richard was the youngest of four children and never married. He was to live with one of his sisters, who also remained unmarried, for most of his adult life.\nHe attended school in Brunswick from the age of seven and at this stage mathematics was not his main interest. The school, Martino-Catharineum, was a good one and Dedekind studied science, in particular physics and chemistry. However, physics became less than satisfactory to Dedekind with what he considered an imprecise logical structure and his attention turned towards mathematics.\nThe Collegium Carolinum was an educational institution between a high school and a university and he entered it in\n1848\nat the age of\n16\n. There he was to receive a good understanding of basic mathematics studying differential and integral calculus, analytic geometry and the foundations of analysis. He entered the University of GÃ¶ttingen in the spring of\n1850\nwith a solid grounding in mathematics.\nGÃ¶ttingen was a rather disappointing place to study mathematics at this time, and it had not yet become the vigorous research centre that it turned into soon afterwards. Mathematics was directed by M A Stern and G Ulrich.\nGauss\nalso taught courses in mathematics, but mostly at an elementary level. The physics department was directed by\nListing\nand\nWilhelm Weber\n. The two departments combined to initiate a seminar which Dedekind joined from its beginning. There he learnt\nnumber theory\nwhich was the most advanced material he studied. His other courses covered material such as the differential and integral calculus, of which he already had a good understanding. The first course to really make Dedekind enthusiastic was, rather surprisingly, a course on experimental physics taught by\nWeber\n. More likely it was\nWeber\nwho inspired Dedekind rather than the topic of the course.\nIn the autumn term of\n1850\n, Dedekind attended his first course given by\nGauss\n. It was a course on least squares and\n[\n1\n]\n:-\n... fifty years later Dedekind remembered the lectures as the most beautiful he had ever heard, writing that he had followed\nGauss\nwith constantly increasing interest and that he could not forget the experience.\nYou can see Dedekind's account of this course at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nDedekind did his doctoral work in four semesters under\nGauss\n's supervision and submitted a thesis on the theory of Eulerian integrals. He received his doctorate from GÃ¶ttingen in\n1852\nand he was to be the last pupil of\nGauss\n. However he was not well trained in advanced mathematics and fully realised the deficiencies in his mathematical education.\nAt this time Berlin was the place where courses were given on the latest mathematical developments but Dedekind had not been able to learn such material at GÃ¶ttingen. By this time\nRiemann\nwas also at GÃ¶ttingen and he too found that the mathematical education was aimed at students who were intending to become secondary school teachers, not those with the very top abilities who would go on to research careers. Dedekind therefore spent the two years following the award of his doctorate learning the latest mathematical developments and working for his\nhabilitation\n.\nIn\n1854\nboth\nRiemann\nand Dedekind were awarded their habilitation degrees within a few weeks of each other. Dedekind was then qualified as a university teacher and he began teaching at GÃ¶ttingen giving courses on\nprobability\nand geometry.\nGauss\ndied in\n1855\nand\nDirichlet\nwas appointed to fill the vacant chair at GÃ¶ttingen. This was an extremely important event for Dedekind who found working with Dirichlet extremely profitable. He attended courses by\nDirichlet\non the theory of numbers, on\npotential theory\n, on definite integrals, and on\npartial differential equations\n. Dedekind and\nDirichlet\nsoon became close friends and the relationship was in many ways the making of Dedekind, whose mathematical interests took a new lease of life with the discussions between the two.\nBachmann\n, who was a student in GÃ¶ttingen at this time\n[\n12\n]\n:-\n... recalled in later years that he only knew Dedekind by sight because Dedekind always arrived and left with\nDirichlet\nand was completely eclipsed by him.\nDedekind wrote in a letter in July\n1856\n[\n4\n]\n:-\nWhat is most useful to me is the almost daily association with\nDirichlet\n, with whom I am for the first time beginning to learn properly; he is always completely amiable towards me, and he tells me without beating about the bush what gaps I need to fill and at the same time he gives me the instructions and the means to do it. I thank him already for infinitely many things, and no doubt there will be many more.\nDedekind certainly still continued to learn mathematics at this time as a student would by attending courses, such as those by\nRiemann\non\nabelian functions\nand\nelliptic functions\n. Around this time Dedekind studied the work of\nGalois\nand he was the first to lecture on\nGalois theory\nwhen he taught a course on the topic at GÃ¶ttingen during this period.\nWhile at GÃ¶ttingen, Dedekind applied for J L Raabe's chair at the Polytechnikum in ZÃ¼rich.\nDirichlet\nsupported his application writing that Dedekind was 'an exceptional pedagogue'. In the spring of\n1858\nthe Swiss councillor who made appointments came to GÃ¶ttingen and Dedekind was quickly chosen for the post. Dedekind was appointed to the Polytechnikum in ZÃ¼rich and began teaching there in the autumn of\n1858\n.\nIn fact it was while he was thinking how to teach differential and integral calculus, the first time that he had taught the topic, that the idea of a Dedekind cut came to him. He recounts that the idea came to him on\n24\nNovember\n1858\n. His idea was that every real number\nr\nr\nr\ndivides the\nrational\nnumbers into two subsets, namely those greater than\nr\nr\nr\nand those less than\nr\nr\nr\n. Dedekind's brilliant idea was to represent the real numbers by such divisions of the rationals.\nDedekind and\nRiemann\ntravelled together to Berlin in September\n1859\non the occasion of\nRiemann\n's election to the\nBerlin Academy of Sciences\n. In Berlin, Dedekind met\nWeierstrass\n,\nKummer\n,\nBorchardt\nand\nKronecker\n.\nThe Collegium Carolinum in Brunswick had been upgraded to the Brunswick Polytechnikum by the\n1860\ns, and Dedekind was appointed to the Polytechnikum in\n1862\n. With this appointment he returned to his home town and even to his old educational establishment where his father had been one of the senior administrators for many years. Dedekind remained there for the rest of his life, retiring on\n1\nApril\n1894\n. He lived his life as a professor in Brunswick\n[\n1\n]\n:-\n... in close association with his brother and sister, ignoring all possibilities of change or attainment of a higher sphere of activity. The small, familiar world in which he lived completely satisfied his demands: in it his relatives completely replaced a wife and children of his own and there he found sufficient leisure and freedom for scientific work in basic mathematical research. He did not feel pressed to have a more marked effect in the outside world: such confirmation of himself was unnecessary.\nAfter he retired, Dedekind continued to teach the occasional course and remained in good health in his long retirement. The only spell of bad health which Dedekind had experienced was\n10\nyears after he was appointed to the Brunswick Polytechnikum when he had a serious illness, shortly after the death of his father. However he completely recovered and, as we mentioned, remained in good health.\nDedekind made a number of highly significant contributions to mathematics and his work would change the style of mathematics into what is familiar to us today. One remarkable piece of work was his redefinition of\nirrational\nnumbers in terms of Dedekind cuts which, as we mentioned above, first came to him as early as\n1858\n. He published this in\nStetigkeit und Irrationale Zahlen\nâ\n(\nContinuity and irrational numbers\n)\nin\n1872\n. In it he wrote:-\nNow, in each case when there is a cut\n(\nA\n1\n,\nA\n2\n)\n(A_{1}, A_{2})\n(\nA\n1\nâ\n,\nA\n2\nâ\n)\nwhich is not produced by any rational number, then we create a new, irrational number a, which we regard as completely defined by this cut; we will say that this number a corresponds to this cut, or that it produces this cut.\nAs well as his analysis of the nature of number, his work on mathematical induction, including the definition of finite and infinite sets, and his work in number theory, particularly in\nalgebraic number fields\n, is of major importance.\nDedekind loved to take his holidays in Switzerland, the Austrian Tyrol or the Black Forest in southern Germany. On one such holiday in\n1874\nhe met\nCantor\nwhile staying in the beautiful city of Interlaken and the two discussed set theory. Dedekind was sympathetic to\nCantor\n's set theory as is illustrated by this quote from\nWas sind und was sollen die Zahlen\nâ\n(\nWhat numbers are and what they will be\n)\n(1888)\nregarding determining whether a given element belongs to a given set :-\nIn what way the determination comes about, or whether we know a way to decide it, is a matter of no consequence in what follows. The general laws that are to be developed do not depend on this at all.\nIn this quote Dedekind is arguing against\nKronecker\n's objections to the infinite and, therefore, is agreeing with\nCantor\n's views.\nAmong Dedekind's other notable contributions to mathematics were his editions of the collected works of\nPeter Dirichlet\n,\nCarl Gauss\n, and\nGeorg Riemann\n. Dedekind's study of\nDirichlet\n's work did, in fact, lead to his own study of algebraic number fields, as well as to his introduction of ideals. Dedekind edited\nDirichlet\n's lectures on number theory and published these as\nVorlesungen Ã¼ber Zahlentheorie\nâ\n(\nLectures on Number Theory\n)\nin\n1863\n. It is noted in\n[\n12\n]\nthat:-\nAlthough the book is assuredly based on\nDirichlet\n's lectures, and although Dedekind himself referred to the book throughout his life as\nDirichlet\n's, the book itself was entirely written by Dedekind, for the most part after\nDirichlet\n's death.\nIt was in the third and fourth editions of\nVorlesungen Ã¼ber Zahlentheorie\nâ\n(\nLectures on Number Theory\n)\n, published in\n1879\nand\n1894\n, that Dedekind wrote supplements in which he introduced the notion of an ideal which is fundamental to ring theory. Dedekind formulated his theory in the ring of integers of an algebraic number field. The general term 'ring' does not appear, it was introduced later by\nHilbert\n.\nDedekind, in a joint paper with\nHeinrich Weber\npublished in\n1882\n, applies his theory of ideals to the theory of Riemann surfaces. This gave powerful results such as a purely algebraic proof of the\nRiemann\n-Roch theorem.\nDedekind's work was quickly accepted, partly because of the clarity with which he presented his ideas and partly since\nHeinrich Weber\nlectured to\nHilbert\non these topics at the University of KÃ¶nigsberg. Dedekind's notion of ideal was taken up and extended by\nHilbert\nand then later by\nEmmy Noether\n. This led to the unique factorisation of integers into powers of\nprimes\nto be generalised to ideals in other rings.\nIn\n1879\nDedekind published\nÃber die Theorie der ganzen algebraischen Zahlen\nâ\n(\nOn the theory of algebraic integers\n)\nwhich was again to have a large influence on the foundations of mathematics. In the book Dedekind\n[\n1\n]\n:-\n... presented a logical theory of number and of complete induction, presented his principal conception of the essence of arithmetic, and dealt with the role of the complete system of real numbers in geometry in the problem of the continuity of space. Among other things, he provides a definition independent of the concept of number for the infiniteness or finiteness of a set by using the concept of mapping and treating the recursive definition, which is so important to the theory of ordinal numbers.\nDedekind's brilliance consisted not only of the theorems and concepts that he studied but, because of his ability to formulate and express his ideas so clearly, he introduced a new style of mathematics that been a major influence on mathematicians ever since. As Edwards writes in\n[\n12\n]\n:-\nDedekind's legacy ... consisted not only of important theorems, examples, and concepts, but a whole style of mathematics that has been an inspiration to each succeeding generation.\nMany honours were given to Dedekind for his outstanding work, although he always remained extraordinarily modest regarding his own abilities and achievements. He was elected to the\nGÃ¶ttingen Academy\n(1862)\n, the\nBerlin Academy\n(1880)\n, the Academy of Rome, the Leopoldino-Carolina Naturae Curiosorum Academia, and the\nAcadÃ©mie des Sciences\nin Paris\n(1900)\n. Honorary doctorates were awarded to him by the universities of Kristiania\n(\nOslo\n)\n, ZÃ¼rich and Brunswick."
