  "biografia": "Paul PainlevÃ©\n's father, LÃ©on Louis PainlevÃ©\n(1832\n-\n1906)\n, was a lithographic draughtsman, born in Paris, the son of Euphrosine CÃ©lestine Leroy and Jean Baptiste PainlevÃ©. He became the owner of a printing ink factory and was quite well-off financially. Paul's mother Antoinette Ãlisabeth DÃ©tang\n(1835\n-\n1893)\n, the daughter of Ãlisabeth Ãtiennette Hayot and Denis DÃ©tang, was born in Meaux, Seine-et-Marne. LÃ©on and Antoinette were married in Paris on\n4\nOctober\n1855\nin the Roman Catholic Church. They had three children, Marie Mathilde PainlevÃ©, born on\n6\nAugust\n1856\n, Blanche Julie PainlevÃ©, born on\n18\nSeptember\n1861\n, and Paul PainlevÃ©, the subject of this biography. Let us say a little about Paul's two sisters since they enter his biography later.\nMarie Mathilde PainlevÃ© worked in lace and corset supplies. She married Ferdinand Lamy and had four children, Jeanne, Fernande, Pierre and Suzanne. Ferdinand Lamy died before\n1901\n, as did one of the children. Blanche Julie PainlevÃ© married Maurice Louis Dainville\n(1856\n-\n1943)\n, a painter and architect, and had a daughter Jeanne Dainville\n(1889\n-\n1939)\nwho married Pierre Appell\n(1887\n-\n1957)\n, the son of\nPaul Appell\n.\nThe three PainlevÃ© children were baptised into the Roman Catholic Church but LÃ©on PainlevÃ© stopped being a practising Catholic, distancing himself from the Church. Paul was\n[\n24\n]\n:-\n... brought up in the simple democratic atmosphere of French skilled artisan family life.\nPaul attended the lycÃ©e Saint-Louis, where he won many prizes, then in\n1877\nhe began his studies at the lycÃ©e Louis-le-Grand\n[\n23\n]\n:-\nLeaving primary school to which he would always remain so deeply attached, he went through high school where everything seemed equally easy ...\nAt Louis-le-Grand he showed himself to be equally outstanding at both sciences and literature. Again he won many prizes across the whole range of the syllabus. By the time his secondary education was completed he was still undecided on the direction that he wanted to take in life, feeling that he would like to take up politics or engineering but in the end chose to embark on the research career.\nHe entered the Ãcole Normale SupÃ©rieure in\n1883\n, and was immediately drawn to mathematics through the influence of outstanding professors like\nPaul Appell\n,\nGaston Darboux\n,\nCharles Hermite\n,\nÃmile Picard\n,\nHenri PoincarÃ©\n, and\nJules Tannery\n. He studied differential and integral calculus as well as descriptive geometry and mechanics. In\n1885\nhe obtained the licence in mathematical sciences and in physical sciences. He received hisÂ agrÃ©gationÂ in mathematics in\n1886\n. While completing the work for his doctoral dissertation, advised by\nÃmile Picard\n, he went to GÃ¶ttingen where he was influenced byÂ\nHermann Schwarz\nÂ andÂ\nFelix Klein\nwhose courses he attended; he received a doctorate in mathematics from Paris in\n1887\nfor his thesis\nSur les lignes singuliÃ¨res des fonctions analytiques\nâ\n(\nOn the singular lines of analytical functions\n)\n. Before giving a little information about his thesis, let us recount an important event in PainlevÃ©'s political development which occurred while he was in GÃ¶ttingen.\nGuillaume SchnaebelÃ© was a French police inspector. He was born near Strasbourg in Alsace, and, after the Franco-Prussian war of\n1870\n-\n71\n, opted to live in France after Strasbourg became part of Germany. SchnaebelÃ© was arrested by the Germans in April\n1887\nwhen on his way to meet with a German police inspector. It was unclear whether he was arrested on French territory or on German territory and the incident nearly led to war between France and Germany. PainlevÃ© was a pacifist and he was appalled both at the strength of nationalism shown by both sides and also the strength of militarism. He felt that the incident had been very badly handled by the French government, and he was also aware the France was in a weak position militarily, which had influenced their actions.\nWe promised to return to PainlevÃ©'s outstanding thesis\n[\n23\n]\n:-\nPainlevÃ©'s thesis focused on the important and remarkable property that the individuality of a function resides, in a way, in its singularities, and that it suffices to know these, which can be in more or less limited number, to be informed about the entire function. He dealt more particularly with functions which have whole lines of singular points; on this subject he demonstrated several new and important theorems and began to orient his results towards the study of new transcendents defined by differential equations.\nHere is an extract from PainlevÃ©'s introduction:-\nThe first part of this work is devoted to the study of a function in the vicinity of a singular line or cut. The notion of cut occurs in the discussion of the\nCauchy\nintegral; it can even be introduced, as shown by M\nHermite\nusing definite integrals where the integration variable is real. The\nTaylor\nseries, converging in a certain circle, also offers a simple example of a cut, and MM\nWeierstrass\n,\nJules Tannery\n,\nAppell\nhave formed numerous series which represent two distinct functions in two different areas of the plane. We list, in the first Chapter, the various singularities that symbols\n(\nand particularly series\n)\ncan present which define in a certain space, an analytical function of z. ...\nIn the second Chapter, we extend to the most general uniform functions the forms of decomposition into sums and products, given in the theory of functions with singular points. In\n1881\n, before M\nMittag-Leffler\n's theorem, M\nÃmile Picard\nindicated, in the case of a circular cut, a form of development into a product, applicable to any cut, and, shortly after, decomposed a function F\n(\nz\n)\n, having for cuts line segments, into a sum of n functions having only one cut, then developed these functions in series. After the discovery of the\nMittag-Leffler\ntheorem, M\nGoursat\nextended this theorem to uniform functions with any singularities. Finally, M\nMittag-Leffler\nhas himself devoted a Memoir to the study of these proposals. We give, with a slightly different demonstration of these theorems, several modes of development in series of functions presenting in the plane a single cut, to which we find ourselves returning. A first development, analogous to the\nTaylor\nseries, is based on conformal representation; the others generalise the expansions, indicated by M\nAppell\nin the case of a holomorphic function inside a contour of arcs of circles. It follows from this theorem that any holomorphic function in a convex region can be developed in this region in a series of polynomials.\nThe notions of residue, order, remainder\n(\ndefined either as integrals or as coefficients\n)\nare therefore easily generalised with the propositions to which they are attached. In particular, the residue theorem and\nLiouville\n's theorems remain for doubly periodic functions with arbitrary singularities.\nThe standard career path for a leading French academic at this time was to obtain a first post in the provinces, then later to attempt to return to Paris. PainlevÃ© followed this route, being appointed as a lecturer in rational and applied mechanics at Lille in\n1887\n, and then returning to Paris in\n1892\nwhere he taught both at the Faculty of Science and at the Ãcole Polytechnique taking up his appointment on\n23\nJuly. This was a rapid return to Paris and shows the high regard in which he was held. In\n1895\nhe was invited to deliver lectures at the University of Stockholm giving the first on\n2\nOctober. The lectures were published in\n1897\nunder the title\nLeÃ§ons sur l'intÃ©gration des Ã©quations diffÃ©rentielles professÃ©es Ã  Stockholm\nâ\n(\nLessons on the integration of differential equations taught in Stockholm\n)\n. These lectures\n[\n23\n]\n:-\n... shine with a particularly vivid brilliance ... He put the best of himself into these lessons and reading them will remain a source of inspiration for our youth for a long time.\nAn important feature of these lectures is the PainlevÃ© Conjecture about the\nn\nn\nn\n-body problem. We quote from\n[\n15\n]\n:-\nAdvised by\nGustav Mittag-Leffler\n, King Oscar II of Sweden and Norway, a protector and supporter of science and especially of mathematics, established in\n1887\nan important prize for solving the\n3\n-body problem. The formulation was very precise: one must obtain, for any choice of the initial data, a solution expressing the coordinates as a power series, convergent for all real values of the time variable. ... Unexpectedly, nobody could provide the desired solution. ... In\n1895\n, at\n32\nyears of age, Paul PainlevÃ© was already one of the most famous mathematicians of his time, and King Oscar II invited him to give a series of lectures at the University of Stockholm in September-November of that year. The event was considered of paramount importance, and even the King attended the introductory lecture. The notes were published in\n1897\nin handwritten form ... The last pages contain an application of the results to the\n3\n-body problem and an opinion of the author concerning the n-body case, formulated as a statement which was known afterwards as the Conjecture of PainlevÃ©.\nFrom\n1896\nPainlevÃ© taught courses at the CollÃ©ge de France as a Professeur supplÃ©ant and at the Ãcole Polytechnique as a RÃ©pÃ©titeur d'analyse. From the following year, he was a MaÃ®tre de ConfÃ©rences at the Ãcole Normale SupÃ©rieure.\nPainlevÃ©'s first area of interest in mathematics was rational transformations of algebraic curves and surfaces. In this topic he introduced the notion of a biuniform transformation. He worked onÂ differential equations, particularly studying their singular points, and on mechanics. His interest in mechanics was a natural one since this subject provided a natural setting for applications of the results which he had proved for differential equations. He solved, using PainlevÃ© functions, differential equations which\nHenri PoincarÃ©\nÂ andÂ\nÃmile Picard\nÂ had failed to solve, showing, asÂ\nJacques Hadamard\nÂ wrote, that:-\n... continuing the work of\nHenri PoincarÃ©\nwas not beyond human capacity.\nFor his outstanding mathematical work PainlevÃ© received many awards. In\n1890\nhe was awarded the Grand Prix des Sciences MathÃ©matiques, then in\n1894\nhe received the prestigious Prix Bordin followed two years later by the Prix\nPoncelet\n. In\n1900\nhe was elected to the geometry section of theÂ\nAcadÃ©mie des Sciences\n.Â For his candidacy to the\nAcademy\n, PainlevÃ© wrote a notice which was published in\n1967\nas\nAnalyse des travaux scientifiques jusqu'en\n1900\nâ\n(\nAnalysis of scientific work up to\n1900\n)\n.\nFor extracts from reviews of this\n1967\npublication, and of other books by PainlevÃ©, see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nA step towards PainlevÃ©'s political career came in\n1899\nwhen he gave evidence at the trial of Alfred Dreyfus in Rennes. Dreyfus had been convicted of treason in December\n1894\nand sentenced to life imprisonment. Evidence came forward that he was innocent but documents were forged in a deliberate miscarriage of justice prompted by anti-Semitism. A new court martial was held in Rennes beginning in August\n1899\nat which Dreyfus was again convicted. The affair became something of great national interest with most people against Dreyfus but he also had some high powered supporters. PainlevÃ© was a witness at the second Dreyfus court martial in Rennes. He said that his statements had been manipulated to make them prosecution evidence against Dreyfus. He also denounced the hand writing expert Alphonse Bertillon. PainlevÃ© would continue to fight for justice for Dreyfus until he was exonerated in\n1906\n. Jean Perrin writes\n[\n28\n]\n:-\n... the Dreyfus affair led a few rare intellectuals to oppose almost the whole of the Country, first ill-informed, then gradually won over. In this drama of which France can remain proud, because each of the two groups that clashed fought selflessly for its belief, because also no other Nation would have allowed the rectification of the error once committed, PainlevÃ© recognised where Justice was, and where from then on was the true interest of the Fatherland, of our Fatherland. ... This passionate love of justice, which the Dreyfus affair revealed in PainlevÃ©, was perhaps the most striking feature of his moral character.\nOn\n8\nNovember\n1901\nPainlevÃ© married Julie Marie Marguerite Petit de Villeneuve\n(1868\n-\n1902)\n, known as 'Gaette', the daughter of the architect AndrÃ© Jules Edmond Petit de Villeneuve and Marie Marguerite LÃ©odie Clairin. Paul and Marguerite PainlevÃ©'s son Jean Marie LÃ©on PainlevÃ©\n(1902\n-\n1989)\nwas born on the\n20\nNovember of the following year and, tragically, Marguerite died six weeks after the birth, on\n31\nDecember\n1902\n, of puerperal fever.Â One of Jean's friends wrote:-\nIt would be hard to find a young man of more radical views and more opposed to the church. ... Jean PainlevÃ©, resourceful and irresponsible as he was, found a way of taking part in everything that bore even the faintest trace of social protest and disorder.\nJean became a filmmaker and is sometimes known today as the father of the documentary film. After PainlevÃ©'s wife died, Jean was looked after for a short time by PainlevÃ©'s sister Blanche but quite soon PainlevÃ© and his widowed sister Marie decided to live together with their four children. They lived first at\n18\nrue SÃ©guier, then at\n81\nrue de Lille in a seven-room apartment\n(\nwith three maids' rooms\n)\n. Marie Lamy, who wished to be independent, continued to carry on her trade in lace and corset supplies while servants took care of the running of the household.\nAt the International Congress of Mathematicians held in Paris in\n1900\n, PainlevÃ© was chairman of the Analysis Section. In\n1904\nPainlevÃ© was a plenary speaker at International Congress of Mathematicians in Heidelberg. He delivered his lecture\nLe problÃ¨me moderne de l'intÃ©gration des Ã©quations diffÃ©rentielles\nâ\n(\nThe modern problem of the integration of differential equations\n)\non\n11\nAugust\n1904\n.\nYou can read the first section of the lecture at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nPainlevÃ© took a special interest in aviation, applying his theoretical skills to study the theory of flight. He approached the Chamber of Deputies in\n1907\narguing that it was necessary to set up a branch of the military involved with aviation; he was successful and the military aviation service was set up. He was Wilbur Wright's first passenger making a record\n1\nhour\n10\nminute flight at Auvours in\n1908\n, became the first person to fly on two different planes when he was a passenger with Henry Farman, then in\n1909\nhe created the first university course in aeronautical mechanics.Â After his flight he wrote\n[\n23\n]\n:-\nThe signal is given; here we are launched into space. Sensation of delights and dizziness. We fly, we fly ... but it is no longer on the Auvours camp that we hover in the growing night, it is on the indefinite face of the Earth, dominated, conquered by the big bird. The conquest of the air is now accomplished. Tomorrow, on grander aircraft, safe and powerful engines, free from weight restrictions, will take away otherwise heavy burdens. The greatest challenge that nature had brought to man is finally met.\nIn\n1910\nPainlevÃ© and\nÃmile Borel\npublished the book\nL'Aviation\n. They begin their Introduction as follows:-\nIt is some\n120\nyears since, first on hot air balloons, then on balloons, man ventured across the ocean by air. Exceeding the eagle and the condor, the balloon made sublime holes in the azure. Poets sang of its glories and its martyrs; they celebrated the audacity of those conquerors of height who dared to complete: \"by the wicker basket, the attack started by the rock of the Titans.\" But the balloon is a toy of the wind, it goes where the air leads it and not where the pilot leads it. By providing it with an engine, by lengthening it into the shape of a fish, Kerbs and Renard, in\n1884\n, gave it direction, or at least, allowed it to move in a certain measure.\nAlthough less skilled in politics than mathematics he began a political career in\n1906\nwhich led to two periods as French Prime Minister. It may seem unfair to say he was less skilled in politics than mathematics when he achieved the highest possible office in politics, but this statement is more meant to comment on his truly outstanding mathematical contributions. Although PainlevÃ© began his political career in\n1906\n, this was not the year he left mathematics. It was the year in which he was elected to the Government as a Paris Deputy for the fifth arrondissement, the Latin Quarter\n[\n24\n]\n:-\nHe was soon distinguished both by the excellent matter of his speeches and by the interest he displayed in military, naval, and aeronautical affairs, and served on several Parliamentary committees concerned with the national forces.\nBy\n1910\nhe had given up all his mathematical posts and had become a full-time politician. His expertise in military affairs meant that after World War I started in\n1914\nhe chaired many committees with a military remit, such as those set up to reorganise munitions, the navy, and aeronautics. He joined the Cabinet in\n1915\nas Minister of Public Instruction and Inventions. By early\n1917\nhe was appointed as head of the Ministry of War and accepted, against his better judgement, the advice of his Commander-in-Chief to launch an all-out attack on the German lines. The attack rapidly failed and PainlevÃ© had to replace his Commander-in-Chief.\nOn Sunday\n20\nMay\n1917\na monument was inaugurated to honour the memory of Marcelin Berthelot and PainlevÃ©, as Minister of War, made a speech. In it he gave high praise to Science\n[\n23\n]\n:-\nIt is Science which will assure to human societies fair and rational laws and organisation. It will solve social problems by multiplying the industrial forces of man and his grip on nature, constantly creating new wealth that will not have been taken from anyone, however that it will bring the final softening of manners by its lessons of fraternity and by the development of intelligences. Already his essentially collective effort has brought to the bottom of our hearts and our minds the life-giving lesson of high solidarity.\nWriting about PainlevÃ© in\n1917\n,\nHenry Baker\nwrote\n[\n11\n]\n:-\nOn the one hand, he is at present one of the very few men whose pronouncements mark the destiny of our Western civilisation; on the other, he lived, not so long ago, in one of the most abstract realms of the modern theory of analytic functions, and very few were, or will ever be, those who fully followed the subtlety of his thought.\nAfter a disagreement with the French Socialists, Prime Minister Ribot was forced out and on\n7\nSeptember\n1917\nand PainlevÃ© became Prime Minister. He played a leading role in the Allied Conference at Rapallo in Italy, but was defeated after returning to Paris and he resigned as Prime Minister on\n13\nNovember\n1917\n. He played little part in political affairs from this time until the election of November\n1919\nwhen he came to the fore as a strong critic of the elected Government. At the next election of May\n1924\nPainlevÃ© was part of the winning alliance and was elected President of the Chamber of Deputies. The alliance had been forged by PainlevÃ© and M Herriot and the latter became Prime Minister.\nPainlevÃ© was put forward for election as President of the Republic but lost out to M Gaston Doumergue. He remained President of the Chamber of Deputies until April\n1925\nwhen M Ãdouard Marie Herriot was defeated on a financial matter. PainlevÃ© then became Prime Minister for a second time\n[\n24\n]\n:-\nHis new Government was weak from the first. Serious disorders in Syria further discredited it. His schemes for financial reform, which fell disappointingly short of what had been expected from a man of his ability, failed to meet with the approval of the Chamber, and onÂ\n21\nÂ NovemberÂ\n1925\nÂ he had to resign.\nPainlevÃ© still retained high office, however, for he returned to his position as Minister of War. In May\n1932\nhis name was put forward in the election for President of the Republic but he withdrew before voting took place. After this he held the position of Minister of Air and in this role he made proposals for an international agreement to end the production of bombers in all countries, and for an international air force to be set up to be used against any aggressor. His plans could be taken no further after the Government fell in January\n1933\n. This ended his political career.\nFor a much more detailed look at his political career, see some of the documents produced by the French National Assembly to celebrate the\n150\nth anniversary of Paul PainlevÃ©'s birth in December\n2013\nat\nTHIS LINK\n.\nIn\n[\n24\n]\nhis personality is described in these terms:-\nPainlevÃ© had a naturally simple and unaffected manner, and was possessed of a singular charm that few persons, even among his opponents, were able to resist. His energy was untiring ...\nJean Perrin writes in\n[\n28\n]\nabout what:-\n... made him loved, the charm of his conversation, his laughter, his extraordinary youth, the strength which was in his gaiety, his verve, his vitality, the flow of his generous words, the Flame which emanated from him, and all that was his soul?\nThomas Greenwood writes in\n[\n20\n]\nabout PainlevÃ©'s death:-\nWhen I went to see him shortly before his untimely death, Prof Paul PainlevÃ© was editing, with the aid of an assistant, the second part of his famous lectures on the \"Mecanique des Fluides\"\nâ\n(\nFluid mechanics\n)\nrecently delivered at the Sorbonne. In the dusk of his life, the 'President', as he was familiarly called by his friends, was thus returning to his favourite studies, for it was as a mathematician that M PainlevÃ© began his extraordinary career. He was slowly recovering from a long and dangerous breakdown and was hoping to give an inaugural lecture in the great hall of the Conservatoire des Arts et Metiers, which was recently named after him in honour of his scientific genius. The hope was not to be fulfilled: instead, it was his coffin which was placed in that very hall before it was borne to the Pantheon. \"I am still holding on to life,\" he was heard to say recently; \"and if I have to let go, I shall try to do it as elegantly as I can!\" These prophetic words became true when on October\n29\n, Prof PainlevÃ© died in his own home from heart failure. In him, France loses one of her most distinguished sons, and the world one of the greatest mathematicians and statesmen of the day.\nYou can read a report of PainlevÃ©'s funeral at\nTHIS LINK\n."
