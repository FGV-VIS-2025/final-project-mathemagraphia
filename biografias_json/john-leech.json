  "biografia": "John Leech\nwas educated at Trent College in Derbyshire. He entered King's College Cambridge, graduating as a\nwrangler\nwith a B.A. in\n1950\n. After graduating Leech was appointed to a post with Ferranti in Manchester where he worked on the construction of an early digital computer.\nIn\n1954\nLeech left Ferranti to return to Cambridge, becoming a research student in the mathematical laboratory. He was appointed as a lecturer in the Computing Laboratory of Glasgow University in\n1959\n. He spent the academic year\n1967\n/\n68\nas a research fellow at the Atlas Computer Laboratory near Harwell in England.\nIn\n1968\na new university was created in Stirling,\n40\nkm from Glasgow. Leech was appointed as Reader and first Head of Computing Science at Stirling. Two years later he was promoted to a Personal Chair, the first awarded by the University of Stirling. He took early retirement in\n1980\n, having worked part-time for a few years before this due to ill-health.\nDouglas Munn\n, writing in\n[\n2\n]\n, describes Leech's mathematical work as follows:-\nBy inclination he was a pure mathematician, with a taste for\nnumber theory\n, geometry and combinatorial\ngroup theory\n, his interests tending towards the particular rather than the general. ... he developed one of the first programs to implement the\nTodd\n-\nCoxeter\ncoset enumeration algorithm - a pioneering achievement in the application of computers to algebra.\nLeech is, however, best known for the Leech lattice which gives rise to three sporadic\nsimple groups\n. In\n1964\nhe published a paper on sphere packing in eight or more dimensions. It contained a lattice packing in\n24\ndimensions. In\n1965\nhe submitted a supplement to the paper giving a packing in\n24\ndimensions with a lattice now known as the Leech lattice. A few months later he found a packing of twice the density and his paper was rewritten appearing in\n1967\n.\nLeech knew that the\nsymmetry group\nwould be interesting, and he worked on it for some time giving a lower bound for its order\n(\nwhich later proved to be the actual order of the group\n)\n. Knowing that he did not have the group theory skills necessary to prove his conjectures he tried to interest others, see\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nI dangled the problem under various noses, including those of\nCoxeter\n,\nTodd\n, and\nGraham Higman\n, but\nConway\nwas the first to swallow the bait...\nA detailed description of this discovery is given in\n[\n1\n]\n.\nA few weeks before his death, Leech visited us in St Andrews on each day for about a week and four of us worked on a number of problems which had been left unsolved by Leech\n30\nyears before. To his great delight we succeeded in solving some\n(\nbut not all\n)\nof the problems. It came as a great shock to me\n[\nEFR\n]\nto hear of his death. In\n[\n3\n]\nthis is described as follows:-\nOne of the most avid supporters of the preservation of the paddle steamer Waverley, John Leech ... collapsed and died on board the ship during the final cruise of the season. ... He was standing between the funnels on the return leg ... between Rothsay and Largs when he suffered a heart attack. As the steamer made its way back up river to Glasgow, the red Ensign was lowered to half mast as a tribute...\nLeech died almost exactly one month after\nGorenstein\nwho had overseen the classification of finite simple groups. The three sporadic groups which Conway deduced from Leech's lattice play an important role in the classification."
