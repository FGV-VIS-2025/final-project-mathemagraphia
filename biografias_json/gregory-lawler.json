  "biografia": "Gregory Lawler\nwas the son of Thomas Comerford Lawler\n(1920\n-\n2005)\nand Patricia Ann Fullerton\n(1927\n-\n2015)\n. Thomas Comerford Lawler, born in Cumberland, Maryland, on\n19\nDecember\n1920\n, was the brother of the Capuchin Franciscan friar Ronald Lawler. Thomas Lawler was educated at Saint Fidelis Capuchin Seminary, Herman, Pennsylvania, served as an engineer in the U.S. army during World War II, then worked for the CIA beginning in\n1951\n. On\n16\nSeptember\n1950\nhe had married Patricia Ann Fullerton, born\n21\nFebruary\n1927\nin West Virginia, in St Mary's Catholic Church\n(\nGovans\n)\n. She was a reporter who had graduated from West Virginia University and had\n[\n39\n]\n:-\n... interviewed President Truman during a train stop in Cumberland, Maryland in\n1949\n.\nThomas and Patricia Lawler had three sons. Peter Augustine Lawler\n(1951\n-\n2017)\n, born\n30\nJuly\n1951\nin Alexandria, Virginia, became Professor of Government at Berry College and was the author of many articles and books on political philosophy and American politics. Thomas Aquin Lawler, born\n11\nMarch\n1953\nin Alexandria, Virginia, became an economist. He reached important positions being vice president of the Chase Manhattan Bank and then vice president of the Federal National Mortgage Association. Gregory Francis Lawler, the subject of this biography, was the youngest of the three brothers, born July\n1955\n.\nAll three of the Lawler children attended Bishop Ireton High School, a Catholic preparatory high school in Alexandria, Virginia, founded in\n1964\n. When the Lawlers were pupils, it was a boys' high school staffed by the Oblates of St Francis De Sales. In\n1972\nGregory Lawler was assistant editor of FLIGHT\n72\n, the Bishop Ireton High School Yearbook. Since Lawler was enthusiastic about mathematics, it is likely that he was the principal author of the section in FLIGHT\n72\ndescribing the Mathematics Department.\nWe give a version of this section at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nWe note that the description of Mathematics in FLIGHT\n72\nis unusual for a school yearbook in that it looks critically at the department, detailing both its strengths and weaknesses.\nAfter graduating from the Bishop Ireton High School, Lawler entered the University of Virginia to major in mathematics. It was an exciting time with many of the professors advising Ph.D. students. Kevin Mor McCrimmon was Chairman of the Department of Mathematics when Lawler began his studies and other professors of mathematics included Marvin Rosenblum, Robert Evert Stong, Edwin Earl Floyd, Gordon Ernest Keller and Leonard Lewy Scott, Jr. Professors in related subjects included James Gordon Simmonds and John Lucas Pfaltz in applied mathematics and computer science, and Roger Sherman in economics. In\n1976\nLawler was awarded a B.A. and was awarded the\nE J McShane\nPrize for his outstanding achievement in mathematics.\nAfter graduating from the University of Virginia, Lawler went to Princeton University to undertake postgraduate studies. He was awarded an M.A. by Princeton in\n1977\nand continued to undertake research for a Ph.D. advised by Edward Nelson\n(1932\n-\n2014)\n. Nelson, born in Decatur, Georgia, lived partly in the USA and partly in Italy before studying for a Ph.D. at the University of Chicago advised by\nIrving Segal\n. He was a National Science Foundation postdoctoral fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study from\n1956\n, then was appointed to Princeton University in\n1959\nand became a full professor in\n1964\n. He published papers on analysis, probability, and mathematical logic\n[\n44\n]\n:-\nAccomplished in many areas of mathematics, Nelson is especially well known for his successful application of probability to quantum field theory, work for which he received the\nAmerican Mathematical Society\n's Steele Prize for Seminal Contribution to Research in\n1995\n. The AMS recognised two papers published in\n1966\nand\n1973\n, respectively, that \"showed for the first time how to use the powerful tools of probability theory to attack the hard analytic questions of constructive quantum field theory,\" the award citation said. The latter paper \"fired one of the first shots in what became known as the Euclidean revolution\", according to the AMS.\nAdvised by Nelson, Lawler wrote the\n61\n-page thesis\nA Self-Avoiding Random Walk\nfor which he was awarded a Ph.D. in\n1979\n. He writes in the thesis:-\nI would like to thank my advisor, Edward Nelson, for suggesting this problem, providing invaluable advice, and giving much needed encouragement. I would also like to thank Bob Anderson for reading the original draft carefully and pointing out a number of errors. I would like to thank the National Science Foundation for graduate support.\nIn the following year he published the results of his thesis in a paper with the same name in the\nDuke Mathematical Journal\n. The Introduction to the paper begins:-\nLet\nZ\nd\n=\n{\n(\nz\n1\n,\nz\n2\n,\n.\n.\n.\n,\nz\nd\n)\n:\nz\ni\nâ\nZ\n}\n\\mathbb{Z}^{d} = \\{(z_{1}, z_{2}, ... , z_{d}): z_{i}  \\in  \\mathbb{Z}\\}\nZ\nd\n=\n{\n(\nz\n1\nâ\n,\nz\n2\nâ\n,\n.\n.\n.\n,\nz\nd\nâ\n)\n:\nz\ni\nâ\nâ\nZ\n}\nbe the integer lattice. A k-step self-avoiding path is a sequence of points\n[\nx\n0\n,\nx\n1\n,\n.\n.\n.\n,\nx\nk\n]\n[x_{0}, x_{1}, ... , x_{k}]\n[\nx\n0\nâ\n,\nx\n1\nâ\n,\n.\n.\n.\n,\nx\nk\nâ\n]\nin\nZ\nd\n\\mathbb{Z}^{d}\nZ\nd\nwith\nx\n0\n=\n0\n,\nâ£\nâ£\nx\ni\nâ\nx\ni\nâ\n1\nâ£\nâ£\n=\n1\nx_{0} = 0, ||x_{i} - x_{i-1}|| = 1\nx\n0\nâ\n=\n0\n,\nâ£\nâ£\nx\ni\nâ\nâ\nx\ni\nâ\n1\nâ\nâ£\nâ£\n=\n1\nfor\ni\n=\n1\n,\n.\n.\n.\n,\nk\ni = 1, ..., k\ni\n=\n1\n,\n.\n.\n.\n,\nk\n, and\nx\ni\nâ\nx\nj\nx_{i} â  x_{j}\nx\ni\nâ\nî\nâ\n=\nx\nj\nâ\nfor\ni\nâ\nj\ni â  j\ni\nî\nâ\n=\nj\n. The study of self-avoiding paths originated in chemical physics as an attempt to model polymer chains. Two major questions were asked. First, if\nÎ³\nd\n(\nk\n)\n\\gamma_{d}(k)\nÎ³\nd\nâ\n(\nk\n)\nis the number of self-avoiding paths of length k, then how does\nÎ³\nd\n(\nk\n)\n\\gamma_{d}(k)\nÎ³\nd\nâ\n(\nk\n)\ngrow with k? Second, what is the mean square distance of the self-avoiding walk from the origin, or more generally, what is the limiting distribution as k approaches infinity of the walk after k steps? While much numerical evidence has been gathered to answer these questions, especially in dimensions two and three, few sharp analytical results have been found.\nIn the review of the paper Harry Kesten writes\n[\n27\n]\n:-\nNo satisfactory results about this have been proven. Even our knowledge of the behaviour of\nÎ³\nd\n(\nn\n)\n\\gamma_{d}(n)\nÎ³\nd\nâ\n(\nn\n)\nfor large n is still very limited. The author obtains results for a different probability measure on the self-avoiding walks. His measure is induced by taking an infinite simple random walk on\nZ\nd\n\\mathbb{Z}^{d}\nZ\nd\nand \"erasing of loops\" from its path until a self-avoiding path is obtained. For\nd\nâ¥\n5\nd â¥ 5\nd\nâ¥\n5\n, the author proves an invariance principle for his self-avoiding walks .... He also obtains some asymptotic results about his loop erasing process for\nd\n=\n4\nd = 4\nd\n=\n4\n. Even though the final result is given in classical terms the author has phrased his proof in terms of nonstandard analysis.\nAlmost all of Lawler's publications up to\n1990\nwere on random walks and many of his results are published in his first book\nIntersections of Random Walks\npublished in\n1991\n. For information about this book, including the Publisher's description, an extract from the Preface, and extracts from some reviews, see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nAfter the award of his Ph.D., Lawler was appointed Assistant Professor of Mathematics at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina in\n1979\n. At Duke University he was promoted to Associate Professor in\n1985\nand then to full professor in\n1991\n. In\n2001\nhe was named A Hollis Edens Professor of Mathematics at Duke University but, in the same year, he was appointed as Professor of Mathematics at Cornell University. He ended his professorship at Duke University in\n2003\n. In\n2006\nhe left Cornell University to take up appointments at the University of Chicago where he was appointed Professor of Mathematics. In\n2013\nhe was named George Wells Beadle Distinguished Service Professor in Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Chicago. As well at having an appointment in the Department of Mathematics, he also has an appointment in the Department of Statistics. In addition, he is affiliated with the Department of Computational and Applied Mathematics, and with the Department of Financial Mathematics.\nIn addition to the above appointments, he was a Visiting Member of the\nCourant\nInstitute of Mathematical Sciences in New York in\n1981\n-\n1982\nand again in\n1986\n-\n1987\n. In\n1989\nhe was a Visiting Associate Professor at Cornell University, then in\n1994\n-\n1995\n, a Visiting Research Scientist, University of British Columbia.\nLawler was elected a Fellow of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics in\n1991\n, a Fellow of the\nAmerican Academy of Arts & Sciences\nin\n2005\n, a Fellow of the\nAmerican Mathematical Society\nin\n2012\n, and a Member of the\nNational Academy of Sciences\nin\n2013\n.\nIn\n2002\nthe International Congress of Mathematicians was held in Beijing in August of that year. Lawler was invited to lecture to Section\n10\n. Probability and Statistics. He gave the lecture\nConformal Invariance, Universality, and the Dimension of the Brownian Frontier\nwhich has the following Abstract:-\nThis paper describes joint work with\nOded Schramm\nand\nWendelin Werner\nestablishing the values of the planar Brownian intersection exponents from which one derives the\nHausdorff\ndimension of certain exceptional sets of planar Brownian motion. In particular, we proof a conjecture of\nMandelbrot\nthat the dimension of the frontier is\n4\n3\n\\large\\frac{4}{3}\\normalsize\n3\n4\nâ\n. The proof uses a universality principle for conformally invariant measures and a new process, the stochastic\nLoewner\nevolution\n(\nSLE\n)\n, introduced by\nSchramm\n. These ideas can be used to study other planar lattice models from statistical physics at criticality. I discuss applications to critical percolation on the triangular lattice, loop-erased random walk, and self-avoiding walk.\nIn\n2018\nthe International Congress of Mathematicians was held in Rio de Janeiro in August of that year. Lawler was invited to give one of the plenary lectures and he gave the lecture\nConformally invariant loop measures\n. His lecture began as follows:-\nOne of the main goals in statistical physics is to understand macroscopic behaviour of a system given the interactions which are mainly microscopic but may exhibit long range correlations. Such models often depend on a parameter and at a critical value of the parameter the collective interaction switches from being microscopic to macroscopic. Critical phenomena is the study of such systems at or near this critical value.\nThere is a wide class of models\n(\npercolation, self-avoiding walk, Ising and Potts model, loop-erased random walk and spanning trees, ...\n)\nwhose behaviour is very dependent on the spatial dimension. There exists a critical dimension above which the behaviour is relatively simple\n(\nalthough it is not always trivial to prove this is true!\n)\n, but below the critical dimension there is \"non mean-field\" behaviour with nontrivial critical exponents for long-range correlations and fractal structures arising.\n...\nGiven the explosive nature of the field, I will not try to give an overview. I have decided to give a personal perspective and to focus on several loop measures and related models, loop-erased random walk\n(\nrelated to uniform spanning trees\n)\nand the Gaussian free field. I start by introducing one of the main characters, discrete loop measures, and show how they are related to some well known objects, spanning trees and determinant of the Laplacian. It also generates one of the random fractals, the loop-erased random walk, and we then discuss what it means to take a scaling limit. This leads to a review of two of the main players in the field: the conformally invariant Brownian loop measure and the\nSchramm\n-\nLoewner\nevolution\n(\nSLE\n)\n. I discuss a number of properties of SLE and focus on the most recent part to finish the characterisation, the natural or fractal parametrisation of the curve.\nIn\n2006\nGregory Lawler,\nOded Schramm\nand\nWendelin Werner\nwere jointly awarded the\nGeorge PÃ³lya\nPrize in Mathematics by SIAM, the\nSociety for Industrial and Applied Mathematics\n[\n45\n]\n:-\nThe\nSociety for Industrial and Applied Mathematics\n'\nGeorge Polya\nPrize was awarded to Gregory F Lawler of Cornell University,\nOded Schramm\nof Microsoft Corporation and\nWendelin Werner\nof UniversitÃ© Paris-Sud at\nSIAM\n's Annual Meeting in Boston,\n10\n-\n14\nJuly\n2006\n. The prize was established in\n1969\nand is given every two years, alternatively in two categories. One is a notable application of combinatorial theory. The other is for a notable contribution in another area of interest to\nGeorge Polya\nsuch as approximation theory, complex analysis, number theory, orthogonal polynomials, probability theory, or mathematical discovery and learning. In\n2006\n, the\nGeorge Polya\nPrize is given for a notable contribution in another area of interest to\nGeorge Polya\n.\nLawler,\nSchramm\nand\nWerner\nreceived the prize for their groundbreaking work on the development and application of stochastic\nLoewner\nevolution\n(\nSLE\n)\n. Of particular note is the rigorous establishment of the existence and conformal invariance of critical scaling limits of a number of\n2\nD lattice models arising in statistical physics.\nIn\n2019\nGregory F Lawler and\nJean-FranÃ§ois Le Gall\nwere awarded the Wolf Prize in Mathematics\n[\n26\n]\n:-\nLawler was honoured \"for his comprehensive and pioneering research on erased loops and random walks,\" and\nLe Gall\nwas selected \"for his profound and elegant works on stochastic processes.\" According to the prize citation, \"the work undertaken by these two mathematicians on random processes and probability, which\n[\nhas\n]\nbeen recognised by multiple prizes, became the stepping stone for many consequent breakthroughs.\"\nThe prize citation for Lawler reads as follows:-\nGregory Lawler has made trailblazing contributions to the development of probability theory. He obtained outstanding results regarding a number of properties of Brownian motion, such as cover times, intersection exponents, and dimensions of various subsets. Studying random curves, Lawler introduced a now-classical model, the Loop-Erased Random Walk\n(\nLERW\n)\n, and established many of its properties. While simple to define, it turned out to be of a fundamental nature, and was shown to be related to uniform spanning trees and dimer tilings. This work formed much of the foundation for a great number of spectacular breakthroughs, which followed\nOded Schramm\n's introduction of the SLE curves. Lawler,\nSchramm\n, and\nWerner\ncalculated Brownian intersection exponents, proved\nMandelbrot\n's conjecture that the Brownian frontier has\nHausdorff\ndimension\n4\n3\n\\large\\frac{4}{3}\\normalsize\n3\n4\nâ\n, and established that the LERW has a conformally invariant scaling limit. These results, in turn, paved the way for further exciting progress by Lawler and others.\nLawler has written a number of excellent books and has been asked to lecture at a large number of institutions throughout the world.\nDetails of eight books by Lawler are given at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nLet us note that his CV\n[\n46\n]\nlists\n111\nlectures or mini-courses from March\n2010\nto February\n2023\nwhich he delivered in\n22\ncountries: Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Costa Rica, Czech Republic, England, Finland, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Peru, Romania, Russia, USA, Singapore, Sweden, and Switzerland.\nWe give a few examples at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nLawler does editorial work for a number of journals. He was an associate editor of the\nAnnals of Probability\n(1991\n-\n1996)\nand editor-in-chief of that journal\n(2006\n-\n2008)\n. He was also an associate editor of the\nAnnals of Applied Probability\n(1997\n-\n1999)\nand an associate editor of\nCombinatorics, Probability, and Computing\nfrom\n1991\n. For the\nAmerican Mathematical Society\nhe was an associate editor of the\nBulletin\n(2009\n-\n2014)\nand an editor of the\nJournal\n(2009\n-\n2013)\n. Lawler was a co-ounder of the\nElectronic Journal of Probability\nin\n1996\nwith Krzysztof Burdzy, from the University of Washington, Seattle, and RenÃ© Carmona from Princeton University. From\n1996\nto\n1999\n, Krzysztof Burdzy and Greg Lawler were co-editors of the new journal and Lawler published two papers in its first volume:\nHausdorff Dimension of Cut Points for Brownian Motion\n; and\nCut Times for Simple Random Walk\n.\nSome information about Lawler's interests outside mathematics are given in\n[\n26\n]\n:-\nBesides his research, Lawler has been involved in the tournament bridge world in investigations of cheating among top competitors, especially the use of statistics to verify allegations. When not doing math, he plays guitar and is in charge of music at the Beverly Unitarian Church in Chicago. In summers he plays on the mathematics department softball team at University of Chicago.\nLet us say a little more about his playing bridge at tournament level. From\n[\n4\n]\nwe learn the Lawler has been a member of Bridge Winners since\n2011\n. He states:-\nI am a maths professor at the University of Chicago who played more bridge when I was younger\n(\nbecame Life Master when I was\n22\nin the late\n1970\ns\n)\nbut have played only infrequently in the last twenty years.\nHis American Contract Bridge League Ranking is Silver Life Master and he is a three time winner of BrightLeaf Summer Sectional award. On Saturday,\n10\nJuly and Sunday,\n11\nJuly\n2021\n, all members of Bridge Base Online were invited to play the Free Weekend Survivor. On the Saturday\n15\n,\n206\nplayers registered to play, and on the Sunday\n3\n,\n802\nplayers qualified to play. The winner of the Free Weekend Survivor was Lawler, playing under his Bridge Base Online Username of\nfuquay\n(\nsee\n[\n13\n]\nfor details\n)\n."
