  "biografia": "CÃ¢ndido Silva Dias\nwas a Brazilian mathematician who was the son of Gabriel Antonio da Silva Dias, an electrician engineer who graduated from Escola PolitÃ©cnica of SÃ£o Paulo in\n1905\n, and AdÃ­lia Lima da Silva Dias, a housewife.\nSince his childhood he used to play with numbers because his father was an engineer and he enjoyed stimulating Silva Dias to do mathematics. As a result of this time playing with numbers, Silva Dias had an early start with arithmetic. When he started studying at primary school, doing mathematics was something that he found very easy to do. He studied at BarÃ£o de Monte Santo Primary School only a hundred metres from his house. The school was well organized with good teachers. After primary school he went to the capital, SÃ£o Paulo, and started studying at Franco Brasileiro High School which was very liberal and had accessible teachers. Teachers and also the students had the possibility to live at the school, and this was where Silva Dias boarded. He enrolled at Escola PolitÃ©cnica of SÃ£o Paulo in February\n1932\nand studied there until the year of\n1934\nreceiving the surveyor diploma. In the same year he still enrolled in the Mathematics course of the College of Philosophy Science and Languages of the University of SÃ£o Paulo.\nYou can read about Silva Dias's own description of his change to mathematics in the interview he gave in\n1997\nat\nTHIS LINK\n.\nSoon after his graduation he was appointed as second scientific assistant to the Italian mathematician\nLuiggi FantappiÃ¨\nand his role was working with exercises of Mathematical Analysis. Afterwards he was promoted to first category scientific assistant working with both theory and exercises in the following year. In\n1937\n, in a Mathematics Seminar, he studied and presented the theory of algebras as developed by\nGaetano Scorza\n. In the same seminar in\n1938\n, he presented the theory of continuous groups applied to differential equations. During his summer vacation of\n1938\n-\n39\n, Silva Dias presented a course on Mathematical Analysis which some engineers had requested.\nSilva Dias married Odila Leite Ribeiro in\n1937\n; they had four children: CÃ¢ndido Leite da Silva Dias\n(\nborn\n1938)\n, now retired, Maria Odila Leite da Silva\n(\nborn\n1940)\n, a University Professor now retired, Guilherme Leite da Silva Dias\n(\nborn\n1942)\n, a University Professor now retired, and Pedro Leite da Silva Dias, a University Professor.\nIn the beginning of\n1939\n, he was in charge of the course in Mathematical Analysis which was part of the first year of the mathematics course. He was appointed to this position by\nFantappiÃ¨\nand the Secretary of Education. Silva Dias remained in this position until\n1941\n. In February\n1939\nhe participated in the examination board for the entrance examinations of the first year of the engineering course at Escola PolitÃ©cnica. He also took part in examination boards in\n1942\n,\n1943\nand\n1945\n.\nBy a decree of\n21\nJanuary\n1942\nhe was appointed to teach the subject Higher Analysis in the mathematics and physics courses in the Faculty of Philosophy, Science and Letters of the University of SÃ£o Paulo. In July\n1942\n, he presented his work entitled \"About the concept of the analytic functional\" to the\nBrazilian Academy of Sciences\n, which was published in its\nAnnals\n. In November of the same year, he defended his doctoral thesis according to the regulation of the Faculty of Philosophy, Science and Letters\n(\nFFCL\n)\nat the University of SÃ£o Paulo and was awarded the mark ten. In\n1943\nhe started teaching Complements of Geometry and Higher Geometry. In August\n1943\nSilva Dias took part in the examining board for the doctoral examinations of the graduate Benedito Castrucci\n(1909\n-\n1995)\n. On\n6\nJuly\n1943\nSilva Dias presented the work \"Application of the theory of the analytical functionals to the study of a solution for a differential equation of infinite order\" to the\nBrazilian Academy of Sciences\n, communicated by Francisco de Oliveira Castro, which was published in its\nAnnals\n. In\n1945\nhe became active in the foundation of the Mathematical Society of SÃ£o Paulo in which he was elected vice-president. In the same year he attended the classes of\nOscar Zariski\n(\non Algebraic Geometry\n)\nand\nAndrÃ© Weil\n(\non Differential Forms,\nde Rham\n's Theorems, and\nHilbert\nspaces\n)\n. He also attended Professor\nAndrÃ© Weil\n's college courses in\n1946\nand\n1947\nas well as professor\nJean Delsarte\n's college extension courses in\n1949\nand\n1950\n.\nIn\n1946\nSilva Dias was appointed professor of infinitesimal calculus at the newly founded College of Industrial Engineering. In\n1947\nhe was hired to teach Complements of Geometry and Higher Geometry in the Faculty of Philosophy, Science and Letters of the University of SÃ£o Paulo. During the winter vacation, he participated in a conference and gave a lecture on the Theory of Proportion. In February\n1948\nhe went to the United States due to the fact that he won a one-year scholarship from Guggenheim Foundation. He was nominated for the scholarship by professors\nAndrÃ© Weil\n,\nJean DieudonnÃ©\nand\nMarshall Stone\n. In March\n1948\nhe was nominated Research Fellow in Mathematics by the University of Harvard and he also studied with professor\nHenri Cartan\nattending the course given by him on Algebraic Topology. In the same year\nTheorems of Existence in Differential Equations\nwas published. In July\n1948\nSilva Dias was transferred to the University of Chicago and was nominated \"Research Associate\" in the mathematics department. In this university he worked with professor\nAndrÃ© Weil\nand he participated in two conferences on Integral and Relative Geometry in\nShiing-shen Chern\n's work, one being Integral Geometry in\nKlein\n's spaces and another on the Theory of Analytical Functional of\nFantappiÃ¨\n. He also attended the courses: Algebraic Topology with professors\nEdwin Spanier\nand\nSaunders Mac Lane\n,\nBanach\n's spaces with professor\nIrving Segal\nand Integral Geometry with Professor\nLuis SantalÃ³\n. In the early April\n1949\n, he went to Princeton in New Jersey, where he was nominated as a member of the Institute for Advanced Study. Silva Dias attended a seminar on \"Fiber Spaces\" with Professor\nShiing-shen Chern\nand conferences with Professor\nNorman Steenrod\non Algebraic Topology. He undertook some research on non-linear analytic functionals and started some research that would be useful for his thesis that he presented in a contest afterwards.\nIn December\n1949\n, CÃ¢ndido was elected President of the Mathematical Society of SÃ£o Paulo. On this occasion he gave an address on the Teaching of College Mathematics in the USA, particularly at the University of Chicago. In November\n1949\nhe participated in the doctoral examining board at the University of SÃ£o Paulo specifically that of Paulus PompÃ©ia\n(1911\n-\n1993)\n. In August\n1950\n, Silva Dias returned to the United States to represent Brazil together with Professor\nLeopoldo Nachbin\nat the Union Conference that discussed the statutes of an International Union of Mathematics that had just been founded. Soon after, he participated in the International Congress of Mathematicians which was held in Harvard. In November\n1950\n, he was elected President of the Mathematical Society of SÃ£o Paulo and presented his work on non-linear analytic functionals at the Second Annual Reunion congress of the Brazilian Society for the Science which was held in Curitiba, ParanÃ¡, Brazil. In April and December of the same year he participated in the doctoral examining board of professors Edison Farah and Luiz Henrique Jacy Monteiro.\nIn June\n1951\n, Silva Dias presented his work on analytic functional structure to the\nBrazilian Academy of Sciences\n. In July of the same year, he was invited for the position of director of research of the mathematical research sector of the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development\n(\nCNPq\n)\n. During his period of office the Institute of Applied and Pure Mathematics was founded.\nIn\n1960\n, he participated in the foundation of the Institute of Mathematical Research of the University of SÃ£o Paulo\n(\nUSP\n)\n, of which he was appointed as the director. In addition, he was the director of the Faculty of Architecture and Urbanism at the University of SÃ£o Paulo. In\n1962\n, he became member of the Council of the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development. In\n1970\n, he was nominated director of the Institute of Mathematics of USP, constituted by the reform of the university in\n1969\n.\nHe retired from the University of SÃ£o Paulo in\n1978\nand in the following year he became professor of the Institute of Mathematics of the Federal University of SÃ£o Carlos and thereafter retiring in\n1990\n.\nFor information about Silva Dias's career, his interaction with the\nBourbaki\nmathematicians and much more, see\nTHIS LINK\n."
