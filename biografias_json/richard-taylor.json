  "biografia": "Richard Taylor\n's parents are John Clayton Taylor and Gillian Mary Schofield. John Taylor is a mathematical physicist, now Emeritus Professor of Mathematical Physics at the University of Cambridge. Richard's mother, Mary Taylor, was a piano teacher. Richard was born in Cambridge but, when he was two years old, the family moved to Oxford where Richard was brought up and attended school. He attended Magdalen College School where he was taught mathematics by Tony Middleton who later became a Lecturer in Mathematics for Physics at Brasenose College, University of Oxford. Taylor said\n[\n12\n]\n:-\nI became interested in mathematics very early, I suspect. My father is a theoretical physicist. There was always a culture of mathematical science in the family. I don't remember exactly, but certainly as a teenager I was interested in mathematics. I just enjoyed reading recreational books on mathematics and trying to do math problems and finding out about more advanced mathematics. There wasn't any one thing that struck me as particularly interesting.Â I guess already in high school it was clear that I was better than most of the other kids in mathematics.\nHe also wrote about his early experiences of mathematics in\n[\n11\n]\n:-\nAlthough never a star at them, I greatly enjoyed the mathematics Olympiads, which gave me my first experience of working on problems which took more than a few minutes to solve. But the biggest influence on my early scientific development was undoubtedly my father, who taught me never to be satisfied until I had really understood something completely. I also learnt from him not to fear asking simple-minded questions.\nAfter completing his school studies at Magdalen College School, Taylor returned to Cambridge where he matriculated at Clare College in\n1980\n. He worked hard at his mathematical studies but also found time for other interests. He was president of 'The Archimedeans' in\n1981\nand\n1982\n. This is a Cambridge mathematical society founded in\n1935\nwhich aims to promote cooperation between all Cambridge mathematical societies. He also enjoyed travelling, particularly to places where he could indulge his love of mountaineering. He visited the Alps, the Indian Himalayas and later the volcanoes of Ecuador and the large Karakoram mountain range. It was number theory which attracted him most among the mathematical topics he studied. He wrote\n[\n11\n]\n:-\nIt also became clear to me that number theory was the field that I found most exciting. I was attracted by the combination of simple problems, beautiful structure and the variety of techniques that were employed.\nHe was. however, somewhat unsure of his own abilities\n[\n12\n]\n:-\n... as you go on, you're always mixing with people who are more talented in mathematics. It is never clear if you have a real talent or just appear talented in the group you are currently mixing with. I really enjoy mathematics. I think great interest in mathematics and determination to persevere accounts for more than people often give credit for. If you are very keen on working on mathematical problems, you usually get good at it, and I think this can make up for a fair amount of mathematical talent. I have certainly known people who are far brighter mathematicians than I am, but if they have thought about a problem for two days and can't solve it, they get bored with it and want to move on.\nTaylor graduated from the University of Cambridge in\n1984\nand, after some doubts as to whether he was good enough to undertake research in an area as demanding as number theory, he decided that he would undertake graduate studies at Princeton in the United States. There he chose to work with\nAndrew Wiles\nwho had taken up a post at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton in\n1981\n, then was appointed a professor at Princeton University in the following year. Taylor spent four years at Princeton\n1984\n-\n88\n, during which time he undertook research for a Ph.D. advised by\nWiles\n. Taylor was awarded his Ph.D. in\n1988\nfor his thesis\nOn congruences between modular forms\n. Two papers coming from the work of his thesis appeared in\n1989\n, namely\nOn Galois representations associated to Hilbert modular forms\n, and\nRepresentations of Galois groups associated to Hilbert modular forms\n.\nAfter graduating from Princeton, Taylor became a fellow of Clare College, Cambridge and a Royal Society European Exchange Fellowship funded a postdoctoral year\n1988\n-\n89\nat the Institut des Hautes Ãtudes Scientifiques outside Paris. One of the major attractions of returning to the University of Cambridge was the fact that\nJohn Coates\n, who had been\nAndrew Wiles\n' thesis advisor at Cambridge in the\n1970\ns, had been appointed to the Sadleirian Chair of Mathematics at Cambridge in\n1986\n. Taylor, still a fellow of Clare College, was appointed Assistant Lecturer\n(1989\n-\n92)\n, Lecturer\n(1992\n-\n94)\n, then Reader\n(1994\n-\n95)\nat Cambridge University during the six years\n1989\n-\n95\n. Taylor moved to Oxford in\n1995\nwhen he was appointed Savilian Professor of Geometry. The announcement was as follows:-\nSavilian Professorship of Geometry, Richard Lawrence Taylor, FRS\n(\nMA Cambridge, Ph.D. Princeton\n)\n, Reader in Number Theory, University of Cambridge, has been appointed to the professorship with effect from\n1\nOctober\n1995\n. Dr Taylor will be a fellow of New College.\nTaylor married Christine Jiayou Chang in\n1995\n. Christine Chang, who was an algebraist, had graduated from Harvard University and, in\n1993\n, had been awarded a NSF Graduate Fellowships to study at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\nTaylor wrote in\n[\n11\n]\n:-\nIn\n1994\nI had the wonderful good fortune to meet Christine Chang, who has made my life much happier. We married in August\n1995\nand now have two children: Jeremy\n(\nborn in\n1998)\nand Chloe\n(\nborn in\n2000)\n. ... In an effort to combine our two scientific careers I left Cambridge University following my marriage to Christine, first for the Savilian chair of geometry at Oxford and then a year later for Harvard University.\nAs he explains in the above quote, after only one year at Oxford, Taylor moved to the United States when he was appointed as a Professor at Harvard University. He explained the reasons for his move in the interview\n[\n12\n]\nwhich he gave shortly after arriving in Harvard to take up the professorship:-\nI guess I got the formal offer\n[\nfrom Harvard\n]\nin the spring\n[\nof\n1996]\nfrom the dean, but we'd obviously talked about it with the faculty\n[\nat Harvard\n]\nfor some time before that. One strong personal reason is that my wife's American and would like to be in America. Also it's a great department. Like I say, it's difficult to imagine a better collection of colleagues in my subject than there is here. By all accounts, the students here are very bright. I don't really have personal experience, but I'm sure it's true.Â I actually visited for six months a couple of years ago, and one thing I like is the sun. Somehow in Britain for half the year, it's extraordinarily dark. That's partly because it's further north and partly because there is more cloud cover. I've heard people complain that in the winter it's cold here, but at least you see the sun. And I like the energy; people are very energetic and enthusiastic here. Something I noticed is that in Britain it's cool to pretend you never do any work. Students there obviously do work because they learn the same stuff as anybody else, but they like to pretend they do nothing. Whereas\n[\nin the United States\n]\n, people in Princeton would come to me and tell me they had spent the last twenty-four hours in the library. Here, they seem to pretend they work harder than they do. I suspect that people work the same in both places; it's just the gloss they put on it.\nIn\n2002\nTaylor was appointed as Herchel Smith Professor of Mathematics at Harvard. He continued to hold this role for the next ten years. From August\n2010\nto December\n2011\n, he was a visitor at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton. In January\n2012\n, he left his position at Harvard to be named the Robert and Luisa Fernholz Professor of Mathematics at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton. Taylor joined the Mathematics Department in the School of Humanities and Sciences of Stanford University in July\n2018\nwhen he was appointed as the new Barbara Kimball Browning Professor. This endowed chair is the highest honour that Stanford University can bestow on a faculty member.\nFor Taylor's\n1996\nreply to the question, \"What are your Major Research Interests and Achievements?\", see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nTo understand the outstanding contributions which Taylor has continued to make we first list prizes and awards he has won and then give the citation for some of these. These awards include:\nLondon Mathematical Society\nWhitehead\nPrize\n(1990)\n; the\nOstrowski\nPrize\n(2001)\n; the\nFermat\nPrize\n(2001)\n; the\nAmerican Mathematical Society\n,\nFrank Nelson Cole\nPrize in Number Theory\n(2002)\n; the\nGÃ¶ttingen Academy of Sciences\nDannie Heineman Prize\n(2005)\n; the Shaw Prize in Mathematics\n(2007)\n; the Clay Research Award\n(2007)\n; and the Breakthrough Prize in Mathematics\n(2015)\n. Other honours include: elected a fellow of the\nRoyal Society\n(1995)\n; elected a fellow of the\nAmerican Mathematical Society\n(2012)\n; elected to the\nNational Academy of Sciences\n(2015)\n; and elected to the American Philosophical Society\n(2018)\n.\nLet us now give some information about some of these prizes and the citation for Taylor.\nThe Ostrowski Prize.\nThe\nOstrowski\nFoundation was created by\nAlexander Ostrowski\n, for many years a professor at the University of Basel. He left his entire estate to the foundation and stipulated that the income should provide a prize for outstanding recent achievements in pure mathematics and the foundations of numerical mathematics. The prize is awarded every other year.\nThe Ostrowski Prize: Citation for Richard Taylor.\nTaylor has been a major contributor to some of the most spectacular developments in number theory over the last ten years. A particularly fascinating and rewarding theme in number theory has been the application of automorphic forms to arithmetic problems related to l-adic\nGalois\nrepresentations. Taylor's extraordinary creativity and impressive technical command of both algebraic geometry and automorphic representation theory allowed him to make deep and profound discoveries in this area. He is best known for his input to the work of\nAndrew Wiles\n, proving the\nTaniyama\n-\nShimura\n-\nWeil\nconjecture in sufficiently many cases to imply\nFermat\n's Last Theorem. In a series of papers, jointly with Diamond, Conrad and Breuil, Taylor recently completed the proof of that conjecture: every rational elliptic curve is covered by a modular curve. The\nTaniyama\n-\nShimura\n-\nWeil\nconjecture is an instance of the Global\nLanglands\nProgram, relating automorphic representations and\nGalois\nrepresentations. Another major achievement of Taylor, together with Michael Harris, is the proof of the Local\nLanglands\nConjecture for\nG\nL\n(\nn\n)\nGL(n)\nG\nL\n(\nn\n)\n, which establishes a similar correspondence over the completions of\nQ\n\\mathbb{Q}\nQ\n. A third and related series of papers, partly in collaboration with N Shepherd-Barron and K Buzzard, concerns a programme laid out by Taylor to prove the\nArtin\nConjecture on the holomorphicity of\nL\nL\nL\n-functions of certain two-dimensional representations of the\nGalois\ngroup of the rational numbers.\nThe American Mathematical Society Cole Prize in Number Theory.\nThe\nFrank Nelson Cole\nPrize in Number Theory is awarded every three years for a notable research memoir in number theory that has appeared during the previous five years\n(\nuntil\n2001\n, the prize was usually awarded every five years\n)\n. The awarding of this prize alternates with the awarding of the\nCole\nPrize in Algebra, also given every three years. These prizes were established in\n1928\nto honour\nFrank Nelson Cole\non the occasion of his retirement as secretary of the\nAmerican Mathematical Society\nafter twenty-five years of service. He also served as editor-in-chief of the Bulletin for twenty-one years.\nThe Cole Prize in Number Theory: Citation for Richard Taylor.\nThe\nFrank Nelson Cole\nPrize in Number Theory is awarded to Richard Taylor of Harvard University for several outstanding advances in algebraic number theory. He led an effort to extend his earlier work with\nWiles\n, to show that all elliptic curves over\nQ\n\\mathbb{Q}\nQ\nare modular, i.e., are factors of the Jacobians of modular curves. In his book with M Harris, he established the local\nLanglands\nconjecture, giving a complete parametrization of the\nn\nn\nn\n-dimensional representations of a\nGalois\ngroup of a local field. He has also made important progress on\n2\n-dimensional\nGalois\nrepresentations, establishing the\nArtin\nconjecture for an infinite class of nonsolvable cases, and increasing our understanding of the conjectures of Fontaine-\nMazur\nand\nSerre\n.\nThe Shaw Prize in Mathematics.\nSee\nTHIS LINK\n.\nThe Breakthrough Prize in Mathematics.\nThe Breakthrough Prize in Mathematics was launched by Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Russian entrepreneur Yuri Milner at the Breakthrough Prize ceremony in December\n2014\n. It aims to recognize major advances in the field, honour the world's best mathematicians, support their future endeavours and communicate the excitement of mathematics to the general public.\nThe Breakthrough Prize: Citation for Richard Taylor.\nThe Breakthrough Prize is awarded to Richard Taylor, Institute for Advanced Study, for numerous breakthrough results in the theory of automorphic forms, including the\nTaniyama\n-\nWeil\nconjecture, the local\nLanglands\nconjecture for general linear groups, and the Sato-\nTate\nconjecture.\nIn October-November\n2013\nTaylor delivered three lectures in the University of California Los Angeles Distinguished Lecture Series.\nTitle:\nReciprocity laws\n.\nAbstract:\nÂ  Reciprocity laws provide a rule to count the number of solutions to a fixed polynomial equation, or system of polynomial equations, modulo a variable prime number. The rule will involve very different objects:Â automorphicÂ forms and discrete subgroups of\nLie\ngroups. The prototypical example is\nGauss\n' law of quadratic reciprocity, which concerns a quadratic equation in one variable. Another celebrated example is theÂ\nShimura\n-\nTaniyama\nÂ conjecture which concerns a cubic equation in two variables. I will start with\nGauss\n' law and work my way up to somewhat more complicated examples. At the end of the talk I hope to indicate the current state of our knowledge.\nTitle:\nGalois theory and locally symmetric manifolds\n.\nAbstract:\nÂ  I will describe recent results showing that one can attach\nGalois\nrepresentations to classes in theÂ cohomologyÂ of the certain locally symmetric\n(\nreal\n)\nmanifolds, namely the quotients of the space of totally positive real symmetric matrices by congruence subgroups of\nG\nL\n(\nn\n,\nZ\n)\nGL(n,\\mathbb{Z})\nG\nL\n(\nn\n,\nZ\n)\n. I will discuss both my joint work with Harris,Â LanÂ and Thorne concerningÂ cohomologyÂ with rational coefficients and the work ofÂ ScholzeÂ onÂ cohomologyÂ with coefficients in a finite field. If time permits I will give some indication of the proofs.\nTitle:\nReciprocity laws for regular, self-dual motive\n.\nAbstract\n: I will discuss recent work with Stefan Patrikis proving the automorphy of regular self-dual motives over the rational numbers. In previous work with Barnet-Lamb, Gee, and Geraghty this was shown modulo an irreducibility hypothesis on the corresponding l-adic representations. The innovation in the more recent work is a simple trick that allows us to by-pass this irreducibility hypothesis that can be hard to check in practice."
