  "biografia": "Roland Richardson\nwas the son of George Josiah Richardson\n(1828\n-\n1898)\n, a teacher in Dartmouth and Lawrencetown, Annapolis, Nova Scotia, and Rebecca Archibald Newcomb\n(1837\n-\n1923)\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nHis mother was a direct descendant of the seventeenth century Simon Newcomb, from whom also sprang\nSimon Newcomb\n, the Nova Scotia-born astronomer, fourth president of the\nAmerican Mathematical Society\n.\nRoland had a younger brother Ralph Percy Richardson, born on\n2\nNovember\n1879\nin Dartmouth.\nThe family moved to a number of different town in Nova Scotia, being in Eastern Passage, Halifax, Nova Scotia in\n1881\n, and Parkers Cove, Annapolis, Nova Scotia in\n1891\n. After completing his secondary education, Richardson was appointed as a teacher at the fishing village of Margaretsville in Annapolis County, Nova Scotia. He began his tertiary education in Acadia University, Wolfville, Nova Scotia, in\n1896\n. This university, first called Queen's College, was founded by Baptists in\n1838\n. Renamed Acadia College in\n1841\n, it had become Acadia University in\n1891\n, five years before Richardson began his studies there. He graduated with an A.B. in\n1898\nand then returned to his teaching job in Margaretsville.\nIn\n1899\nRichardson was appointed as principal of the High School in Westport, Nova Scotia. One of the pupils at Westport was Louise Janet MacHattie who had been born on\n6\nDecember\n1879\nin South River Lake, Nova Scotia, Canada. Their friendship grew over the following years and, as we explain below, they married in\n1908\n. Richardson continued as principal of the High School in Westport for three years before, in\n1902\n, he entered Yale University. He graduated with an A.B. in\n1903\nand was awarded a Master's degree in the following year. In\n1904\n, having earned an A.M., he was appointed as an Instructor in Mathematics at Yale and at the same time began to undertake research advised by\nJames Pierpont\n. In the autumn of\n1896\nPierpont\nhad become an Assistant Professor at Yale, then in\n1898\nhe had been appointed as a full professor. After attending the\nDeutsche Mathematiker-Vereinigung\nin Munich in September\n1899\nhe had become interested in the theory of functions of a real variable and integration, and published the papers\n(\nP\n1)\nOn multiple integrals\n(1905)\nand\n(\nP\n2)\nOn improper multiple integrals\n(1906)\n. He had also published the book\n(\nB\n)\nLectures on the Theory of Functions of Real Variables\n(1905)\n. Given these research interests it was natural that he should steer Richardson in this direction. In\n1906\nhe published his first paper\nImproper multiple integrals\nwhich builds on\nPierpont\n's work in the book and two papers just mentioned. Richardson writes in his paper:-\nThis paper is a continuation of a recent article\n[\nP\n2]\nby Professor\nPierpont\nin this journal. In that article attention is called to the fact that two methods for defining improper multiple integrals are available; one being that ordinarily followed; the other, that due to\nde la VallÃ©e-Poussin\n. In the present paper the theory will be developed from the latter point of view. ... In this paper we shall regard the field of integration as limited. In a later paper various conditions for continuity, inversion of the order of integration, and reduction of multiple integrals to multiply iterated integrals will be discussed for both finite and infinite fields. In general it will be assumed that, in any partial aggregate in which the integrand is limited, the integral exists. In nearly all cases, however, the reasoning will hold for an upper or a lower integral. In any instance where the notation is not explained, the reader is referred to the paper cited above, or to a recent treatise\n[\nB\n]\non the theory of functions by the same author.\nRichardson was awarded his Ph.D. in\n1906\nfor his thesis\nImproper Multiple Integrals\n. His next paper was\n34\npages long and was presented to the\nAmerican Mathematical Society\nin three parts; on\n28\nApril\n1906\n, on\n3\nSeptember\n1906\n, and on\n27\nApril\n1907\n. The three parts formed the paper\nThe integration of a sequence of functions and its application to iterated integrals\nwhich was submitted to the Society in January\n1908\nand published in its\nTransactions\nlater that year. The paper begins as follows:-\nThe fundamental principle involved in this memoir is the integration of a sequence of functions. As this depends essentially upon an inversion in the order of passing to a limit, applications are readily made to several important topics. In particular, the equality of a multiple integral and the corresponding iterated integrals is here treated, also the integration of a series term by term, and the differentiation of both series and definite integrals. Hitherto in the integration of sequences the condition of uniform convergence in some form has played an important role. In this paper the methods are entirely independent of any such condition of convergence.\nThe papers\nImproper multiple integrals\n(1906)\nand\nThe integration of a sequence of functions and its application to iterated integrals\n(1908)\ncontain material from his doctoral thesis.\nIn\n1907\nRichardson accepted the offer of an appointment as assistant professor of mathematics at Brown University. This offer was made with the condition that he spend the academic year\n1908\n-\n09\nat the University of GÃ¶ttingen in Germany undertaking study and research. He married Louise Janet MacHattie, the daughter of Alexander John and Janet McHattie, on\n4\nJune\n1908\nin Montreal Canada. On the following day, they sailed for Europe. While in Germany he attended the eightieth convention of German naturalists and physicians held at Cologne on\n20\n-\n26\nSeptember\n1908\n. Richardson writes in\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nMathematics and astronomy together formed one of the thirty-one sections. The total attendance was about two thousand, of which the\nDeutsche Mathematiker-Vereinigung\nas a sub-division claimed nearly one hundred. ... Under the influence of President\nKlein\n, the mathematical society devoted the meetings largely to the problems of applied mathematics ...\nIn\n1909\nRichardson returned to his position as Assistant Professor of Mathematics at Brown University. He continued in this role until\n1912\nwhen he was promoted to associate professor. Three years later, in\n1915\n, he became a full professor and head of the Department of Mathematics. In\n1926\n, in addition to his other roles, he was appointed as dean of the Graduate School. Roland and Louise had one son, George Webdell Richardson, born\n7\nJuly\n1920\nin Providence, Rhode Island.\nOn\n30\nDecember\n1929\nhe completed his naturalisation documents which contains the following details. His address was\n44\nUniversity Avenue, Providence, Rhode Island, his occupation was college dean and his age is\n51\nyears. It gives the personal description: Colour - white; Complexion - light; Colour of eyes - blue; Colour of hair - brown; Height -\n5\nfeet\n11\ninches; Weight -\n180\nlbs. In fact it was only in May\n1932\nthat the process was completed and he become a naturalized citizen of the United States.\nWe quote from\n[\n1\n]\nconcerning Richardson's achievements at Brown:-\nRichardson arrived at Brown shortly after a \"Graduate Department,\" with its own Dean, had been organized, and when only one member of the mathematics department was offering advanced courses. The number of such courses had been appreciably increased when he became chairman of the department. Soon he was a member of more than one important administrative committee including the Graduate Council. In\n1926\nhe was appointed the successor to the Dean of the Graduate Department which became the Graduate School in the following year. He held this position until\n1948\n, when he became listed among \"Officers Emeriti.\" Both within and without the University the School became recognized as a really vitalizing intellectual force. This development, for which the Dean was almost wholly responsible, led to Brown's election in\n1933\nas an institutional member of the Association of American Universities. Even though by\n1928\nRichardson's duties as dean and secretary, in addition to demands upon him as chairman of a department, had forced him to give up his own scientific research, he had through the years been laying sure foundations for the establishment of a strong department, for attracting not only candidates for the doctorate in mathematical analysis, but also those seeking post-doctoral inspiration. From\n1929\nuntil his retirement as chairman in\n1942\n,\n28\nPh.D. degrees in mathematics had been awarded at Brown. In\n1938\n(\nafter more than a decade of earlier consideration\n)\nwhen the American Mathematical Society was active in the establishment of Mathematical Reviews, Richardson was mainly instrumental in arranging not only that Brown should provide housing for the project, but also that its chief editor should be brought from Europe as a professor, adding strength to his department.\nAs early as\n1930\nthe Council of the\nAmerican Mathematical Society\nhad given earnest consideration to the important problem of providing a means of publication for research memoirs in the field of applied mathematics. The seed thus sown in the secretary's thought, fertilized and greatly expanded by needs connected with World War II, led to a splendidly conceived pioneer undertaking. The following descriptive extract is taken from the Brown University Faculty Meeting records for October,\n1949\n: \"In the summer of\n1941\n, through his\n[\nRichardson's\n]\nefforts and with financial aid from foundations and government, there was established at Brown a Program of Advanced Instruction and Research in Applied Mechanics. Able men, including many who had come to this country from abroad, were brought here to teach, and substantial numbers of students\n(\nat one time exceeding a hundred\n)\nwere recruited. Under war conditions the original educational aim of the Program, to train a succession of able young doctors in applied mathematics, especially in the various fields of mechanics, was of necessity modified. The demand by government and industry for the services of young men trained even for the short space of a year provided sufficient evidence of the usefulness of this Program for war purposes. At the same time substantial amounts of investigation connected with the war were carried on by the staff. To supplement the Program, Brown University in\n1943\nfounded the Quarterly of Applied Mathematics, a journal which renders international service in its field. In\n1946\nthe original educational aim of this Program was restored and the Program reorganized under the name Graduate Division of Applied Mathematics.\" During\n1943\n-\n46\nthe dean was also a member of the applied mathematics panel of the National Defense Research Committee.\nYou can read Richardson's own description of his efforts at Brown University to develop applied mathematics at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nIn December\n1920\nRichardson became the Secretary of the\nAmerican Mathematical Society\n. He took over from\nFrank Cole\nwho was the Society's second Secretary serving from\n1896\nto\n1920\n.\nRaymond C Archibald\n, the author of\n[\n1\n]\n, was in an excellent position to witness Richardson's contributions as Secretary:-\nBy my attendance at Council meetings throughout the whole of Richardson's term of office as secretary, and through constant personal contacts, I became convinced that his contributions and influences towards this status were indeed great. He had a thorough grasp of every topic which he presented, in excellent form, for the Council's consideration; he was endowed with infinite capacity for taking pains, and was always forward-looking, receptive to new ideas, while constantly mindful of the Society's finances. In personal relations he was remarkably kindly and cooperative, and inspired confidence and affection. No American mathematician was more widely known among his colleagues and the careers of scores of them were notably promoted by his time-consuming activities in their behalf. And such help was being freely rendered up to the time of his death. Richardson was deeply appreciative of the Council's action not only in presenting to him a beautifully hand-illuminated copy of the resolution of appreciation adopted by the Council upon his retirement as secretary, together with a silver coffee set, and for Mrs Richardson a handbag, but also in dedicating to him the\n1941\nvolume of this Bulletin.\nA number of articles written by Richardson were important in taking an overview of different aspects of mathematics instruction in America. As an example, we give a short extract from his paper\nThe Ph.D. Degree and Mathematical Research\n(1936)\n(\nsee\n[\n7\n]\n)\nin which he looks at the number of college teachers of mathematics in America at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nRichardson attended the International Congress of Mathematicians at Zurich, Switzerland, on\n4\n-\n12\nSeptember. In the article\n[\n3\n]\nhe gives an excellent account of that Congress. Let us give one small quote:-\nIt is of interest to note that the first International Mathematical Congress was held in Zurich in\n1897\nand that the president of that gathering, Dr\nGeiser\n, was present at this meeting. The\n1932\nCongress was organized by the University and the Technical Institute of Zurich, and Professor\nFueter\nof Zurich presided in admirable fashion. The first scientific session was presided over by\nHilbert\nand he was given a great ovation.\nMathSciNet list\n79\npublications by Richardson but the article\n[\n1\n]\nlists only\n35\n. The discrepancy arises since the many reports which he published in the\nBulletin\nof the\nAmerican Mathematical Society\nas Secretary of the Society are listed individually in MathSciNet, but only as a single item in\n[\n1\n]\n. Only\n15\nof his publications are research papers, however, since his duties prevented him from having the time to undertake research for much of his career.\nRichardson received many honours for his contributions in addition to those bestowed by the\nAmerican Mathematical Society\nmentioned in a quote above. He received a D.C.L. from Acadia University\n(1931)\n, an LL.D. from Lehigh University\n(1941)\nand an LL.D. from Brown University. He was elected a fellow of the\nAmerican Academy of Arts and Sciences\n, serving on the Council\n1932\n-\n34\n, and again as vice-president in\n1945\n-\n49\n. He was also elected a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, a member of the\nDeutsche Mathematiker-Vereinigung\n, and a member of the\nCircolo Matematico di Palermo\n.\nHis death in\n1949\nwas due to a thrombosis. He was buried in Camp Hill Cemetery, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada.\nLet us end this biography by quoting from\nRaymond C Archibald\nabout Richardson's personal qualities:-\nHe had insight and remarkable organizing abilities, associated with exceptional mental powers. His complete honesty of character, natural wisdom, and selfless devotion to high educational ideals, commanded the admiration of his associates. He was endowed with a spirit of unaffected friendliness, the desire to play a part in helping and encouraging others to achieve the best of which they were capable, and as a result he was blest with a host of friends. There was never-ending hospitality at his home. Indirectly Mrs Richardson contributed in no small measure to the happy solution of many of her distinguished husband's problems."
