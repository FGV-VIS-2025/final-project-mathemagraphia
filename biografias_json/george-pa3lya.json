  "biografia": "George PÃ³lya\n's parents were Anna Deutsch and Jakab PÃ³lya who were both Jewish. Anna was from a family who had lived for many generations in Buda, and she had been nineteen years old in\n1872\nwhen the towns of Buda, Obuda, and Pest had administratively merged to become the city of Budapest. Perhaps we should say a little about George PÃ³lya's names, for the situation is not quite as it appears. In fact, although Jakab PÃ³lya had the name \"PÃ³lya\" when his son GyÃ¶rgy\n(\nor George as he was later known\n)\nwas born, he had only called himself PÃ³lya for the five preceding years. Before that his name had been Jakab PollÃ¡k but, in order to understand why Jakab PollÃ¡k changed his name to PÃ³lya, we need to look at both his career and at a little Hungarian history.\nJakab was trained as a lawyer, ran his own law firm which failed, and then worked for the international insurance company Assicurazioni Generali of Trieste. However what he really wanted was a university post in which he could conduct research into the subjects which really interested him, namely economics and statistics. After\n1867\nHungary had gained full internal independence within the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy and the political philosophy of the country was to move towards a Hungarian state that was both Magyar in spirit, and in its institutions. What better way for Jakab PollÃ¡k to improve his chances of a university post than to change his name from a Jewish sounding one to one which sounded really Hungarian. He did just that in\n1882\nand whether it contributed to his success in getting an appointment as a\nPrivatdozent\nat the University of Budapest, one cannot say but he received such a post shortly before he died in his early fifties when George was ten years old.\nIn fact although George's parents were Jewish, he was baptized into the Roman Catholic Church shortly after his birth. How did this come about? Well Jakab, Anna, and their three children at the time, converted from the Jewish faith to the Roman Catholic faith in\n1886\n, the year before George's birth.\nWhen Jakab PÃ³lya died in\n1897\nhe left a wife, Anna aged\n44\nat the time, and five children. George had an older brother JenÃ¶, who was\n21\nyears old and studying medicine when his father died, two older sisters Ilona\n(10\nyears older than George\n)\nand FlÃ³ra\n(8\nyears older than George\n)\nwho went to work for the insurance company Assicurazioni Generali to help support the family, and a younger brother LÃ¡slÃ³\n(4\nyears younger than George\n)\n. It is worth pointing out that JenÃ¶, who loved mathematics and always regretted not having pursued that subject, is perhaps as well known to medical people as George is to mathematicians. However, it was LÃ¡slÃ³ who was considered the brightest of the children, but sadly he was killed in World War I before making a name for himself. Perhaps given how much effort his father had put in trying to enter the academic profession, it is slightly surprising that George's mother should press him to follow his father's profession of law but this is exactly what she did.\nGeorge attended elementary school in Budapest and received his certificate in\n1894\nwhich recorded\n(\nsee for example\n[\n2\n]\n)\n:-\n... diligence and good behaviour.\nFollowing this he entered the DÃ¡niel Berzsenyi\nGymnasium\nstudying the classical languages of Greek and Latin as well as the modern language of German and of course Hungarian. At school PÃ³lya's favourite subjects were biology and literature and in this latter subject he received \"outstanding\" grades as he did in geography and other subjects. It is rather unusual that someone who went on to spend their life being so fascinated by so many different branches of mathematics should not have fallen in love with the subject at school but in PÃ³lya's case this is exactly what happened. He did not score particularly high marks in mathematics at the Gymnasium, his work in geometry being graded as merely \"satisfactory\". He did score rather better in arithmetic, however. The reason for his lack of success in mathematics may well have been due to poor teaching, and he would later describe two of his three mathematics teachers at the gymnasium as \"despicable teachers\".\nPÃ³lya enrolled at the University of Budapest in\n1905\nsupported financially by his brother JenÃ¶ who was by now a surgeon. He began to study law but found it so boring that he gave up that topic after one semester. He then studied his favourite school subjects of languages and literature for two years, gaining his certificate which allowed him to teach Latin and Hungarian in a gymnasium. It was a qualification of which he was proud but never put it to use. He then became very interested in philosophy but his professor, BernÃ¡t Alexander, advised him to take physics and mathematics courses to help him understand this subject, so eventually he was made to study mathematics. He made the witty remark, which should not be taken seriously\n[\n4\n]\n:-\nI thought I am not good enough for physics and I am too good for philosophy. Mathematics is in between.\nAt the University of Budapest PÃ³lya was taught physics by\nEÃ¶tvÃ¶s\nand mathematics by\nFejÃ©r\n. PÃ³lya said\n[\n4\n]\n:-\nI was greatly influenced by\nFejÃ©r\n, as were all Hungarian mathematicians of my generation, and, in fact, once or twice in small matters I collaborated with\nFejÃ©r\n. In one or two papers of his I have remarks and he made remarks in one or two papers of mine, but it was not really a deep influence.\nThe academic year\n1910\n-\n11\nPÃ³lya spent studying at the University of Vienna where he earned money by teaching the son of an important local dignitary\n(\nhis pupil, apparently, lacking any talent whatsoever\n)\n. In Vienna he attended mathematics lectures by\nWirtinger\nand\nMertens\nbut continued to have a strong interest in physics attending lectures in relativity, optics and other topics. In the following year he returned to Budapest where he was awarded a doctorate in mathematics having studied, essentially without supervision, a problem in the theory of geometric probability. He then spent much of\n1912\nand\n1913\nat GÃ¶ttingen where he mixed with a whole host of leading mathematicians such as\nKlein\n, CarathÃ©odory,\nHilbert\n,\nRunge\n,\nEdmund Landau\n,\nWeyl\n,\nHecke\n,\nCourant\nand\nToeplitz\n.\nIn fact PÃ³lya left GÃ¶ttingen in rather unfortunate circumstances. He explained the incident in a letter to Bieberbach in\n1921\n(\nsee for example\n[\n2\n]\n)\n:-\nOn Christmas\n1913\nI travelled by train from ZÃ¼rich to Frankfurt and at that time I had a verbal exchange - about my basket that had fallen down - with a young man who sat across from me in the train compartment. I was in an overexcited state of mind and I provoked him. When he did not respond to my provocation, I boxed his ear. Later on it turned out that the young man was the son of a certain Geheimrat; he was a student, of all things, in GÃ¶ttingen. After some misunderstandings I was told to leave by the Senate of the University.\nHe received an offer of an appointment at Frankfurt but, before taking up this appointment, he went to Paris for a short visit early in\n1914\n, meeting\nÃmile Picard\nand\nHadamard\nbut not enjoying his visit a great deal mainly due to dreadful accommodation. From the wide range of mathematical stars that PÃ³lya had met the mathematician who was the greatest influence on him was\nHurwitz\n. Therefore when PÃ³lya learnt during his stay in Paris that\nHurwitz\nhad arranged an appointment as Privatdozent for him at EidgenÃ¶ssische Technische Hochschule ZÃ¼rich, where\nHurwitz\nhimself held the chair of mathematics, PÃ³lya decided to accept\n[\n4\n]\n:-\nI was... deeply influenced by\nHurwitz\n. In fact I went to ZÃ¼rich in order to be near\nHurwitz\nand we were in close touch for about six years, from my arrival in ZÃ¼rich in\n1914\nto his passing in ...\n1919\n. And we have one joint paper, but that is not the whole extent. I was very much impressed by him and edited his works. I was also impressed by his manuscripts.\nIn ZÃ¼rich, in addition to\nHurwitz\n, PÃ³lya had\nGeiser\n,\nBernays\n,\nZermelo\nand\nWeyl\nas colleagues. Of course his arrival in ZÃ¼rich was in the year that World War I started, but at first this caused PÃ³lya no real problems since a soccer injury he had received as a student meant that he was not deemed medically fit for service in the Hungarian army. This was fortunate for him since, by this time, he held firm pacifist views. Life became more difficult as the war progressed, however, since the Hungarian army, becoming more desperate for soldiers as the war progressed, required PÃ³lya to return to Hungary, to join the army, and to fight for his country; he refused. This did have the consequence that it would be many years after the war ended before PÃ³lya was able to return to Hungary without fear of arrest for failing to undertake war service. He took Swiss citizenship, although this did not protect him from the Hungarian authorities, and in\n1918\nhe married a Swiss girl, Stella Vera Weber, who was a daughter of the professor of physics at the University of NeuchÃ¢tel. In fact, although it is difficult to see why he waited so long, PÃ³lya did not return to Hungary until\n1967\n,\n54\nyears after his last visit to his native land.\nPÃ³lya first met\nSzegÅ\non Budapest in around\n1913\nwhen he returned there between his various studies abroad.\nSzegÅ\nat this time was a student at Budapest and PÃ³lya discussed a conjecture he had made on\nFourier\ncoefficients with\nSzegÅ\n. In fact\nSzegÅ\nwent on to prove PÃ³lya's conjecture and this became his first publication. When several years later PÃ³lya decided to write a problem book on analysis he knew that it was not a task he could accomplish without help, so he turned to\nSzegÅ\nand over a number of years the two assembled a wonderful collection of problems. In\n[\n4\n]\nPÃ³lya explained why he approached putting across mathematical ideas in a different way to that previously used:-\nI came very late to mathematics. ... as I came to mathematics and learned something of it, I thought: Well it is so, I see, the proof seems to be conclusive, but how can people find such results? My difficulty in understanding mathematics: How was it discovered?\nWhat was the great novelty which made PÃ³lya and\nSzegÅ\n's book of analysis problems so different? It was PÃ³lya's idea to classify the problems not by their subject, but rather by their method of solution. PÃ³lya and\nSzegÅ\napproached the publisher Springer in\n1923\nwith their idea for a two volume work and in\n1925\nAufgaben und LehrsÃ¤tze aus der Analysis\nâ\n(\nProblems and theorems from calculus\n)\nappeared. This work was\n[\n5\n]\n:-\n... a mathematical masterpiece that assured their reputations.\nPÃ³lya had been promoted to extraordinary professor at ETH in ZÃ¼rich in\n1920\n. He received a Rockefeller Fellowship in\n1924\nto enable him to study with\nHardy\nin England. He spent\n1924\npartly in Oxford, partly in Cambridge, working with\nHardy\nand\nLittlewood\nand they began a collaboration on the book\nInequalities\nwas published in\n1934\n. While the book was being worked on, PÃ³lya continued a remarkable series of publications, with a total of\n31\npapers appearing during the three years\n1926\n-\n28\n. Given the range, depth and number of these publications it is not surprising that he was promoted to Ordinary Professor at ETH in\n1928\n.\nIn reviewing\n[\n3\n]\n, Duren gave this summary of PÃ³lya's mathematical achievements:-\nPÃ³lya was arguably the most influential mathematician of the\n20\nth\ncentury. His basic research contributions span complex analysis, mathematical physics,\nprobability theory\n, geometry, and combinatorics. He was a teacher par excellence who maintained a strong interest in pedagogical matters throughout his long career.\nWhile in ZÃ¼rich his output of mathematics was very large and wide ranging. For example, in\n1918\nhe published papers on series,\nnumber theory\n, combinatorics and voting systems. The following year, in addition to papers on these topics, he published on astronomy and probability. While he was doing this wide range of work he was also proving some of his deepest results in the study of integral functions.\nIn\n1933\nPÃ³lya was awarded a second Rockefeller Fellowship, this time to allow him to visit Princeton. While he was in the United States\nBlichfeldt\ninvited him to visit Stanford which he did, and greatly enjoyed being there. He returned to ZÃ¼rich but in\n1940\nthe political situation in Europe forced PÃ³lya to move to the United States where, after working at Brown University for two years and Smith College for a short while, he took up an appointment at Stanford. Before going to the United States PÃ³lya had a draft of a book\nHow to solve it\nwritten in German. He had to try four publishers before finding one to publish the English version in the United States but it sold over one million copies over the years and has been translated in\n17\nlanguages. Schoenfeld described its importance in\n[\n24\n]\n:-\nFor mathematics education and the world of problem solving it marked a line of demarcation between two eras, problem solving before and after PÃ³lya.\nPÃ³lya explained in\nHow to solve it\nthat to solve problems required the study of heuristic:-\nThe aim of heuristic is to study the methods and rules of discovery and invention .... Heuristic, as an adjective, means 'serving to discover'. ... its purpose is to discover the solution of the present problem. ... What is good education? Systematically giving opportunity to the student to discover things by himself.\nHe also gave the wise advice:-\nIf you can't solve a problem, then there is an easier problem you can solve: find it.\nPÃ³lya published further books on the art of solving mathematical problems. For example\nMathematics and plausible reasoning\n(1954)\n, and\nMathematical discovery\nwhich was published in two volumes\n(1962\n,\n1965)\n.\nWhile we are looking at PÃ³lya's contributions to teaching, and many people consider this to be his greatest contribution to mathematics, let us give some further quotes from PÃ³lya on this topic. First a quote from a lecture on teaching mathematics in primary schools:-\nMathematics in the primary schools has a good and narrow aim and that is pretty clear in the primary schools. ... However, we have a higher aim. We wish to develop all the resources of the growing child. And the part that mathematics plays is mostly about thinking. Mathematics is a good school of thinking. But what is thinking? The thinking that you can learn in mathematics is, for instance, to handle abstractions. Mathematics is about numbers. Numbers are an abstraction. When we solve a practical problem, then from this practical problem we must first make an abstract problem. ... But I think there is one point which is even more important. Mathematics, you see, is not a spectator sport. To understand mathematics means to be able to do mathematics. And what does it mean doing mathematics? In the first place it means to be able to solve mathematical problems.\nNext we give a quote from PÃ³lya regarding teaching in general:-\nTeaching is not a science; it is an art. If teaching were a science there would be a best way of teaching and everyone would have to teach like that. Since teaching is not a science, there is great latitude and much possibility for personal differences. ... let me tell you what my idea of teaching is. Perhaps the first point, which is widely accepted, is that teaching must be active, or rather active learning. ... the main point in mathematics teaching is to develop the tactics of problem solving.\nLet us briefly discuss some of the research which PÃ³lya carried out in many different areas of mathematics. It was so wide ranging and so plentiful that there is no way that we can do more than mention a few aspects. In probability PÃ³lya looked at the\nFourier\ntransform of a probability measure, showing in\n1923\nthat it was a characteristic function. He wrote on the normal distribution and coined the term \"central limit theorem\" in\n1920\nwhich is now standard usage. In\n1921\nhe proved his famous theorem on random walks on an integer lattice. He considered a\nd\nd\nd\n-dimensional array of lattice points where a point moves to any of its neighbours with equal probability. He asked whether given an arbitrary point\nA\nA\nA\nin the lattice, a point executing a random walk starting from the origin would reach\nA\nA\nA\nwith probability\n1\n. PÃ³lya's surprising answer was that it would for\nd\n=\n1\nd = 1\nd\n=\n1\nand for\nd\n=\n2\nd = 2\nd\n=\n2\n, but it would not for\nd\nâ¥\n3\nd â¥ 3\nd\nâ¥\n3\n. In later work he looked at two points executing independent random walks and also at random walks satisfying the condition that the moving point never passed through the same lattice point twice.\nGeometric symmetry and the enumeration of symmetry classes of objects was a major area of interest for PÃ³lya over many years. He added to the understanding of the\n17\nplane crystallographic groups in\n1924\nby illustrating each with tilings of the plane. This paper inspired\nEscher\nto produce his famous work on periodic drawings. PÃ³lya's work using generating functions and\npermutation groups\nto enumerate isomers in organic chemistry was of fundamental importance.\nHis main contribution to combinatorics is his enumeration theorem, published in\n1937\n. Read, in\n[\n18\n]\n, describes this as:-\n... a remarkable theorem in a remarkable paper, and a landmark in the history of combinatorial analysis.\nThe theorem solves the problem of how many configurations with certain properties exist. It has applications such as the enumeration of chemical compounds and the enumeration of rooted trees in graph theory. In fact a whole new area of graph theory called enumerative graph theory grew up based on PÃ³lya's ideas.\nPÃ³lya's interest in complex analysis led him to investigate singularities of power series, gap theorems, power series with integral coefficients and those taking integral values at the positive integers, the PÃ³lya representation for entire functions of exponential type, and the location of zeros. He also worked on\nconformal mappings\nand\npotential theory\n, and he was led to study\nboundary value problems\nfor\npartial differential equations\nand the theory of various functionals connected with them. His methods applied particularly to isoperimetric problems in domains with a high degree of symmetry. Together with\nSzegÅ\n, he wrote the now classic text\nIsoperimetric inequalities in mathematical physics\nin\n1951\n.\nSchiffer\nwrites in\n[\n23\n]\n:-\nThe whole work displays the taste of the authors for the concrete and explicit result, for elegance and ingenious methods.\nIn\n1953\nPÃ³lya retired from Stanford, but continued with an exceedingly active mathematical life particularly concerning himself with mathematical education. He continued his association with Stanford as Professor Emeritus and, on\n13\nDecember\n1977\n, a dinner was given there to mark his\n90\nth\nbirthday at which many friends and colleagues gave glowing tributes. His teaching career, however, was still not over and in\n1978\nhe taught a course on combinatorics in the Computer Science Department at Stanford.\nHe received many honours for his outstanding contributions and we only mention a few here. He was elected an honorary member of the\nHungarian Academy\n, the\nLondon Mathematical Society\n, the\nMathematical Association\nof Great Britain, and the\nSwiss Mathematical Society\n. He was elected to the\nNational Academy of Sciences of the United States\n, the\nAmerican Academy of Arts and Sciences\n, the AcadÃ©mie Internationale de Philosophie des Sciences de Bruxelles, and the California Mathematics Council. he was a corresponding member of the\nAcadÃ©mie des Sciences\nin Paris.\nLet us end this article with\nFrank Harary\n's tribute to PÃ³lya\n[\n11\n]\n:-\nWith no hesitation, George PÃ³lya is my personal hero as a mathematician. ...\n[\nhe\n]\nis not only a distinguished gentleman but a most kind and gentle man: his ebullient enthusiasm, the twinkle in his eye, his tremendous curiosity, his generosity with his time, his spry energetic walk, his warm genuine friendliness, his welcoming visitors into his home and showing them his pictures of great mathematicians he has known - these are all components of his happy personality. As a mathematician, his depth, speed, brilliance, versatility, power and universality are all inspiring. Would that there were a way of teaching and learning these traits."
