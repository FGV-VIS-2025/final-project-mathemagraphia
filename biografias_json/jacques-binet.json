  "biografia": "Jacques Binet\n's parents were Philippe Binet\n(1743\n-\n1815)\nand RenÃ©e Marie Jollivet\n(1760\n-\n1836)\n. Philippe Binet was born in Paris and a student at the Academy there. He was awarded two medals and a prize for architecture. He spent several years in Italy, returned to Paris where he was involved in the design of the School of Medicine, and then went to Rennes where he was involved in many projects including the cathedral. However, the French Revolution stopped work on the cathedral and Philippe Binet died before it recommenced. The Jollivet family was in the pottery business in Rennes. Philippe and RenÃ©e were married in Rennes on\n1\nJuly\n1777\nand had five children: Paul RenÃ© Binet\n(\nborn\n1779)\n; Joseph Philippe Binet\n(1783\n-\n1796)\n; Jacques Philippe Marie Binet\n(\nthe subject of this biography,\n1786\n-\n1856)\n; Philippe Thomas Binet\n(1788\n-\n1855)\n; and AdÃ©laide Binet\n(1792\n-\n1810)\n. The family were devoted Roman Catholics and staunch supporters of the King.\nPaul RenÃ© Binet was, as we see from the above dates, seven years older than his brother Jacques, the subject of this biography. Since Paul RenÃ© Binet also became a mathematician, his career was clearly a highly significant influence on Jacques as he grew up. Therefore before giving details of Jacques we look briefly at Paul RenÃ© Binet. After schooling in Rennes, he entered the Ãcole Polytechnique in\n1798\nin the same class as\nSimÃ©on-Denis Poisson\n. He graduated in\n1801\nwhile Poisson had graduated in the previous year. Paul Binet was appointed to teach at the Ãcole Centrale de Rennes, then as professor at the AcadÃ©mie d'OrlÃ©ans. He moved back to Paris and was appointed to the LycÃ©e Bonaparte. He was, in addition to his position at the LycÃ©e Bonaparte, a rÃ©pÃ©titeur at the Ãcole Polytechnique from\n1808\nto\n1831\n. We note also that Jacques' younger brother Philippe Thomas Binet was admitted to the Ãcole Polytechnique on\n28\nSeptember\n1809\n. He graduated in\n1811\nand then worked for the Construction des Vaisseaux.\nJacques Binet was educated first at Rennes. He entered the Ãcole Polytechnique in Paris on\n22\nNovember\n1804\nin the same class as\nAugustin Jean Fresnel\n. After graduating in\n1806\n, he was appointed as a student engineer at the Department of Bridges and Roads of the French government. This, however, was not to his liking and he quickly decided that he wanted to make a career as a teacher of mathematics. He left the Department of Bridges and Roads and took up a position at the LycÃ©e Bonaparte, but he only taught there for a short time.\nJacques Binet became a teacher at Ãcole Polytechnique in\n1807\nand, one year later, he was appointed as a rÃ©pÃ©titeur to assist the professor of applied analysis and descriptive geometry. He held this position from\n1808\nto\n1814\n. During this time the professors of descriptive geometry were\nGaspard Monge\n(\nwho held this professorship\n1794\n-\n1809)\n,\nJean Nicolas Pierre Hachette\n(\nwho held this professorship\n1799\n-\n1815)\n, and\nFranÃ§ois Arago\n(\nwho held this professorship\n1810\n-\n1816)\n.\nBinet published his first two papers in the journal\nCorrespondance sur l'Ãcole Polytechnique\nin\n1809\nand\n1810\n. He was assisted in this by Hachette who was the editor of the journal. Binet's first paper\nDes trois axes rectangulaires des surfaces du second degrÃ©, qui ont un centre\nâ\n(\nThe three rectangular axes of the surfaces of the second degree, which have a centre\n)\nappears in the\nCorrespondance\nwith a heading that gives M Binet as the author while in the index the paper is attributed to J P M Binet. However, although the paper gives the proof of a theorem as stated and proved by J P M Binet, the paper itself was written by\nJean Nicolas Pierre Hachette\n, the editor of the\nCorrespondance sur l'Ãcole Polytechnique\n. In the introduction to the paper when it states that the paper gives an improvement on a theorem in the author's\n1801\nMÃ©moire\nit is referring to a\nMÃ©moire\nwritten by\nHachette\n. Binet's second paper\nProposition de gÃ©omÃ©trie\nâ\n(\nA proposition in geometry\n)\nappears in the\nCorrespondance\nwithout any author in its heading and the paper not listed in the index. However, it also was written by\nHachette\nwho states that the paper consists of a theorem as stated and proved by J P M Binet.\nBinet became a member of the\nSociÃ©tÃ© philomathique\non\n14\nMarch\n1812\n. The\nAcademy of Sciences\nhad been closed in\n1793\nand many of the members of the\nAcademy\nhad joined the\nSociÃ©tÃ© philomathique\ngiving it a rather special status. In\n1795\nthe Institut National replaced the\nAcademy\nbut the\nSociÃ©tÃ© philomathique\ncontinued to have an important role in the scientific life of Paris.  Around\n1814\nBinet submitted his memoir\nSur l'expression analytique de l'Ã©lasticitÃ© et de la raideur des courbes Ã  double courbure\nâ\n(\nOn the analytical expression of the elasticity and stiffness of curves of double curvature\n)\nto be considered for publication. It was assigned to\nLazare Carnot\nand\nGaspard de Prony\nwho were asked to report on it. Here is an extract from their report\n[\n3\n]\n:-\nAfter a purely geometric introduction, containing some new formulas, relating to polygons whose sides do not all lie in the same plane, and to curves of double curvature, the author considers problems of equilibrium which are the particular object of the paper. He successively introduces the effect of the action of forces on a polygon of the type just described and on curves of double curvature. He established in both systems a theory which is applicable both to the case of stiffness and to the case of elasticity. ... In general the analysis is managed with much skill; and the geometric introduction, which would itself be an interesting memoir, ought to confirm, and even increase, the good opinion which has been formed of his scientific merit, from the different works which he has earlier submitted to the judgement of the Class.\nFor a longer extract from this report see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nFor a complete list of Binet's papers see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nIn\n1814\nBinet was appointed examiner of descriptive geometry at the Ãcole Polytechnique then, in\n1815\n, he was appointed Examiner in Geodesy. His work in this role covered descriptive geometry and 'graphic arts,' but sometimes he had to deal with physics questions. He succeeded\nSimÃ©on-Denis Poisson\nas professor of mechanics in\n1815\n. In\n1816\nnot only did Binet become an inspector of studies at the Ãcole Polytechnique but he also became an editor of the edition of\nLagrange\n's\nMÃ©canique analytique\nâ\n(\nAnalytical mechanics\n)\nthat was being prepared two years after\nLagrange\ndied. Binet's paper\nSur l'expression analytique de l'Ã©lasticitÃ© et de la raideur des courbes Ã  double courbure\nâ\n(\nOn the analytical expression of the elasticity and stiffness of curves of double curvature\n)\nwhich we mentioned above did much to add to\nLagrange\n's work as the reporters\nLazare Carnot\nand\nGaspard de Prony\nnoted\n(\nsee\n[\n3\n]\nor our longer extract of the report at\nTHIS LINK\n)\n:-\n[\nBinet\n]\nwas right to announce that his researches might serve as an explanation and supplement of several chapters of the 'MÃ©canique analytique'.\nThe CollÃ¨ge Royal in Paris was renamed in\n1795\nas the CollÃ¨ge de France. Although there were changes in this new College, nevertheless it continued to offer students the chance of attending free lecture courses.\nJean-Baptiste-Joseph Delambre\nwas appointed as the professor of astronomy at the College in\n1807\nand from around\n1815\nBinet was appointed as his assistant.\nDelambre\ndied in August\n1822\nand, in the following year, Binet was appointed to fill the vacant chair of astronomy at the CollÃ¨ge de France.\nIn\n1820\nBinet had married Marie ElÃ©onore MÃ©nard Dubourg\n(1798\n-\n1860)\n. They had a son Paul Jacques Binet\n(1822\n-\n1878)\nwho married Marie Anne Cramail\n(1829\n-\n1903)\nin\n1856\n. They had a son Paul Jacques Marie Binet\n(1865\n-\n1940)\nand we give these details of Binet's son and his grandson since both maintained the family tradition and were students at the Ãcole Polytechnique. Binet's son entered in\n1842\nwhile his grandson entered in\n1884\n.\nAugustin-Louis Cauchy\nhad been appointed as professor of analysis and mechanics at the Ãcole Polytechnique in\n1816\n. Although\nCauchy\nhad an outstanding reputation as a researcher, he was renowned for giving lectures which were both too difficult and too pure in nature\n[\n3\n]\n:-\nCauchy\n's effectiveness as a teacher, however, is another matter. During the\n1820\ns the school earnestly asked him to modify his teaching of mathematical analysis, but without success.\nIn\n1825\nFranÃ§ois Arago\n, who was professor of applied analysis, and Binet, who was inspector of studies, wrote a joint letter in which they complained about the lack of knowledge of practical mathematics attained by\nCauchy\n's students. This was followed up by critical comments about\nCauchy\n's teaching by\nGaspard de Prony\n. As with Binet's criticisms, there was no suggestion that what\nCauchy\ntaught was anything but top quality, rather the complains were that it was not appropriate for students at the Ãcole Polytechnique. We should note that on a personal level Binet and\nCauchy\nwere friends both being staunch Royalists.\nHowever the revolution of July\n1830\nwas unfortunate for Binet. The revolution started after Charles X published restrictive ordinances on\n26\nJuly which were contrary to the spirit of the Charter of\n1814\n. There were protests, demonstrations and fighting on July\n27\n,\n28\nand\n29\n. Binet was a strong supporter of Charles X so it was bad news for him when Charles X abdicated on August\n2\nand, a week later, Louis-Philippe was proclaimed King of France. Binet was far too much associated with the previous regime to be acceptable to that of Louis-Philippe and he was dismissed as inspector of studies on\n13\nNovember\n1830\n.\nBinet investigated the foundations of matrix theory which was to set the scene for later work by\nCayley\nand others. He discovered the rule for multiplying matrices in\n1812\nand it is almost certainly for this that he will be remembered rather than his other work.\nHe did, however, write a number of important papers which were influential in the development of mathematics, in particular he wrote\nMÃ©moire sur les intÃ©grales dÃ©finies EulÃ©riennes et sur leur application Ã  la thÃ©orie des suites; ainsi qu'Ã  l'Ã©valuation des fonctions des grands nombres\nâ\n(\nMemoir on Eulerian definite integrals and their application to the theory of series; and the evaluation of the functions of large numbers\n)\nin\n1839\n. In this paper Binet introduced what today is called the Beta function\nB\n(\nm\n,\nn\n)\nB(m,n)\nB\n(\nm\n,\nn\n)\n. It has been suggested that Binet chose the notation\nB\nB\nB\nand called it a\nbeta function\n, because of the first letter of his own name. However, there is no evidence to support this claim. In the same year he published\nRÃ©flexion sur le problÃ¨me de dÃ©terminer le nombre de maniÃ¨res dont une figure rectiligne peut Ãªtre partagÃ©e en triangles au moyen de ses diagonales\nâ\n(\nReflections on the problem of determining the number of ways in which a straight face can be divided into triangles by its diagonals\n)\nin the\nJournal de MathÃ©matiques Pures et AppliquÃ©es\n. This journal, known as\nLiouville\n's Journal, had been set up by\nJoseph Liouville\nin\n1836\nand he actively sought papers for the journal by encouraging mathematicians to write them. In\n1838\nOlinde Rodrigues\nhad published a paper on the number of ways one can divide a polygon.\nLiouville\nthought the problem deserved further work and approached Binet encouraging him to investigate. Binet's\nRÃ©flexion sur le problÃ¨me de dÃ©terminer le nombre de maniÃ¨res dont une figure rectiligne peut Ãªtre partagÃ©e en triangles au moyen de ses diagonales\nâ\n(\nReflections on the problem of determining the number of ways in which a straight face can be divided into triangles by its diagonals\n)\nwas his contribution which in turn inspired further work on the problem by\nEugÃ¨ne Catalan\nand\nGabriel LamÃ©\n. The numbers that result from the problem of dissecting a polygon into triangles by means of non-intersecting diagonals are now called the '\nCatalan\nnumbers' although they could equally well be named after any of a number of mathematicians who investigated them including\nLeonhard Euler\nand\nJan Segner\nin addition to those just mentioned.\nYou can see more about\nCatalan\nnumbers at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nThe\n1841\nBinet wrote on number theory, making a contribution to the theory of the Euclidean algorithm in his paper\nNote sur une nouvelle mÃ©thode pour trouver le plus grand commun diviseur des nombres entiers, ou des polynÃ´mes algÃ©briques, et sur l'application de cette mÃ©thode aux congruences du premier degrÃ©\nâ\n(\nNote on a new method for finding the greatest common divisor of integers or algebraic polynomials, and the application of this method to congruences of the first degree\n)\n. This particular piece of work is discussed in\n[\n6\n]\nwhere Shallit writes:-\nBinet's analysis\n[\nof the algorithm\n]\nis surprisingly modern in presentation.\nBinet is remembered for 'Binet's form' of the\nFibonacci numbers\n. He discovered this formula in\n1843\nwhich gives a direct value of the\nFibonacci\nnumber\nF\nn\nF_{n}\nF\nn\nâ\nwithout using the recurrence relation. Suppose\na\na\na\nand\nb\nb\nb\nare the roots of the equation\nx\n2\nâ\nx\nâ\n1\n=\n0\nx^{2} - x - 1 = 0\nx\n2\nâ\nx\nâ\n1\n=\n0\nwhere\na\nâ\nb\n=\nâ\n5\na - b = â5\na\nâ\nb\n=\nâ\n5\n. Then Binet gave the expression\na\nn\nâ\nb\nn\na\nâ\nb\n\\Large\\frac{a^n  - b^n}{a - b}\na\nâ\nb\na\nn\nâ\nb\nn\nâ\n.\nNow although this is known as the Binet form, he was not the first to find this expression since\nde Moivre\nhad discovered it much earlier in\n1718\n.\nOn\n3\nFebruary\n1851\nLÃ©on Foucault\ninvited members of the\nAcademy of Sciences\nto come to the Paris Observatory to see his pendulum experiment which demonstrated the rotation of the earth. The mathematicians and physicists, including Binet, viewed the experiment of the pendulum swinging in Meridian Hall, slowly rotating over the Paris Meridian. On the same day\nFranÃ§ois Arago\nread a paper by\nFoucault\nto a meeting of the\nAcademy of Sciences\n. In this paper\nFoucault\nclaimed that the time taken for the pendulum to complete one revolution was\n24\nsin\nâ¡\nÂ\nq\n\\Large\\frac{24}{\\sinÂ q}\\normalsize\ns\ni\nn\nÂ\nq\n2\n4\nâ\nhours, where\nq\nq\nq\nis the latitude at which the experiment is performed. This meant that, in Paris, it should take just under\n32\nhours which was experimentally verified. However,\nFoucault\nwas not an expert mathematician and he had no mathematical derivation of his formula. The first to address the\nAcademy\non the topic following the events of\n3\nFebruary was Binet whose written presentation was read to the Academy on\n10\nFebruary. Binet began\n(\nquoted in\n[\n1\n]\n)\n:-\nFoucault\nhas asked me in what way the mechanical result he had obtained accords with mathematical theories.\nHe then described various references to a pendulum that had been made by previous mathematicians. In particular he quoted\nPoisson\nwho had written in an article published in the\nJournal de l'Ãcole Polytechnique\nin\n1837\n(\nquoted in\n[\n1\n]\n)\n:-\nThe force acting on the plane of oscillation of the pendulum is too small to move the pendulum perceptibly, to have any apparent influence on its movement.\nFoucault\n's experiment clearly showed that\nPoisson\nwas wrong but Binet was reluctant to say so. He tried to give\nPoisson\nthe benefit of the doubt by writing\n(\nquoted in\n[\n1\n]\n)\n:-\nBut the passage just cited permits a doubt:\nPoisson\ndoesn't report a calculation of the force of which he speaks, and thus it is insufficient to allow us to know whether the perturbing force is very small, to conclude that it will only produce an imperceptible effect after a large number of oscillations.\nHe then explained what mathematics would be necessary to prove\nFoucault\n's sine law but said more time would be needed to complete the proof. He did so in a further report to the\nAcademy\none week later on\n17\nFebruary, when he gave a complete mathematical derivation of Foucault's sine law.\nBinet's other contributions were in the fields of physics and astronomy, and since he held the chair of astronomy at the CollÃ¨ge de France for over\n30\nyears this is not surprising. In all he wrote over\n60\npapers.\nWe have attempted to give a complete list at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nAmong the honours which Binet received for his work was Chevalier de la LÃ©gion d'Honneur on\n1\nMay\n1821\nand election to the\nAcadÃ©mie des Sciences\nin\n1843\n, succeeding\nSylvestre Lacroix\nwho died in May of that year. In\n1856\nhe was elected as president of the\nAcademy\nand, as president, chaired the weekly meeting on\n28\nApril of that year. However, at the beginning of the meeting on Monday,\n12\nMay, it was announced to the members that Binet was very seriously ill and, before the meeting ended, his death was reported to those present. He was buried in Montparnasse Cemetery on\n14\nMay\n14\nwith members of his family and many of his colleagues present.\nGabriel LamÃ©\nand\nAugustin Cauchy\ngave an eulogy. In September\n1994\nthe University of Rennes named its association for doctoral students for Jacques Binet. A street in the Cleunay district of Rennes bears Jacques Binet's name."
