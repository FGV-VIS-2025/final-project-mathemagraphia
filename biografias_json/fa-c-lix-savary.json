  "biografia": "FÃ©lix Savary\nwas a student at the Ãcole Polytechnique completing his studies in\n1815\n. He then taught at the Ãcole, becoming a professor of astronomy and geodesy there in\n1831\n. There he became a founder of studies into surveying and machines.\nSavary also served as librarian at the Bureau des Longitudes from\n1823\nto\n1829\n. Then on\n24\nDecember\n1832\n, in recognition of his achievements, he was elected to the\nAcadÃ©mie des Sciences\n.\nHe worked on electromagnetism and electrodynamics, some work being done jointly with\nAmpÃ¨re\n. In particular, on this topic, he wrote\nMÃ©moire sur l'application du calcul aux phenomÃ¨nes Ã©lectro-dynamique\nâ\n(\nMemoir on the application of calculus to electro-dynamic phenomena\n)\n(1823)\n.\nSavary also developed a theorem\n(\nnamed after him\n)\non the curvature of a roulette, the curve traced out by a point on a fixed curve which rolls on a second curve.\nHe wrote on the rotation of magnets, studied the intensity of magnetism through an electrical discharge\n(1827)\n, and applied the laws of gravity to determine the orbits of double stars in close orbit round each other\n(1827)\n. In fact, on the topic of double stars, he published\nMÃ©moire sur les orbites des Ã©toiles doubles\nâ\n(\nMemoir on the orbits of double stars\n)\n(1827)\n, and\nSur la dÃ©termination des orbites que dÃ©crivent autour de leur centre de gravitÃ© deux Ã©toiles trÃ¨s rapprochÃ©es l'une de l'autre\nâ\n(\nOn the determination of orbits of two stars very close to each other moving around their centre of gravity\n)\n(1827)\nin\nConnaissance des Temps\n. The star x Ursae Majoris is a double star and Savary demonstrated that the two stars move in elliptical orbits with the centre of gravity at the focus of the ellipses. Although this might appear to be a fairly simple consequence of\nNewton\n's law of gravitation, nevertheless it was important for it was the first verification of the laws for objects outside the solar system. This was the first verification of the universal nature of Newton's laws. We look at this episode in a little more detail following\n[\n3\n]\n.\nIt was on\n2\nMay\n1780\nthat\nWilliam Herschel\ndiscovered that the star x Ursae Majoris was a visual double star. The relative positions of the two stars were first accurately measured in\n1826\nby Friedrich Georg Wilhelm von Struve, who was at that time director of Russia's Dorpat Observatory.\nWilliam Herschel\n's son,\nJohn Herschel\n[\n3\n]\n:-\n... was one of the first people to compute orbits for double stars, and x Ursae Majoris was the system that he selected for the initial demonstration of his method, in\n1831\n. Priority in that field, however, must go to Savary, who gave, in Connaissance des Temps for\n1830\n(\nwhich according to its title page was published in\n1827)\n, a description of a method of calculating orbits for double stars. In a supplementary paper in the same volume, he opens by saying\n(\nin French of course: the following is my translation\n)\n, \"It has occurred to me that it could be useful to add to\n[\nthe formulae for computing orbits\n]\ntheir numerical application to a specific example. So I will suppose the following data, without attributing any reality to them\" - and he lists four dates with associated separations and position angles, all highly reminiscent of, but not identical with, actual observations of x Ursae Majoris. Five pages later, at the conclusion of some stiff mathematics, he ingenuously remarks, \"The data from which we started in the preceding calculations are very close to four observations of the double star x of the great bear\"; he then goes on to tabulate all\n11\nof the observations available at the time, and to show that the computed orbit satisfies them very well. In fact,\nSir John Herschel\n, whose orbit was, on his own admission, not nearly such a good match, complained with good reason that Savary had cheated - not Sir John's word: that is my prÃ©cis of the gentlemanly circumlocution that occupies nearly a whole page\n(\nhis paragraph\n64)\n- by choosing to solve data that were only approximately the observed ones!"
