  "biografia": "Ernst Straus\n's mother was Rahel Goitein who had the distinction of being one of the first women medical students officially studying at a German university. She trained at Heidelberg and went on to become a well-known doctor. Ernst's father Elias Straus was an attorney. It was a Jewish family with Elias being a major figure in the Zionist movement in Germany at the time. It was also a large family with Ernst being the youngest of his parents five children; three daughters and two sons. He was\n[\n3\n]\n:-\n... raised to cherish cultural and humanitarian values.\nHe made his first mathematical discovery at the age of five when he worked out the formula for the sum of an arithmetic progression.\nOn\n30\nJanuary\n1933\nHitler came to power in Germany and it was immediately clear that those of Jewish origin would suffer. Later in\n1933\nElias Straus died of cancer and right after this Rahel Straus and the rest of the family moved to Palestine and made their home in Jerusalem. There Rahel practised medicine and became very active in social work. Ernst attended a number of different schools but he had no high school diploma when he entered the Hebrew University. There he was taught by\nMotzkin\nwho later emigrated to the United States and undertook joint work with Straus which we will discuss below. Again Straus had no undergraduate degree when he went to the United States and enrolled in Columbia University in New York in\n1941\n. He obtained his Master's degree in\n1942\nand continued to undertake research towards his doctorate under F J Murray. However the most significant event in his career happened two years later when\nEinstein\nselected him as his assistant. Before moving to Princeton, Straus married Louise Miller who was, like him, a graduate student at Columbia University. They married in the autumn of\n1944\nand moved to Princeton where Straus began working with\nEinstein\nat the Institute for Advanced Study. Louise and Ernst had two sons, Daniel born in\n1954\nand Paul born in\n1957\n.\nDuring the four years that Straus worked with\nEinstein\nthey wrote three joint papers. One of these was\nThe influence of the expansion of space on the gravitation fields surrounding the individual stars\n(1945)\n. M Wyman, reviewing this paper, writes:-\nIt is assumed that the gravitational potentials and their first derivatives will be continuous at the boundary of the spherically symmetric star. An approximate solution of the field equations for empty space is obtained and the gravitational potentials thus determined are required to piece together continuously with the known gravitational potentials for a pressure free, spatially constant density of matter. Under these conditions it is possible to show that the\nSchwarzschild\nfield can be transformed into a solution of the problem.\nIn\n1946\nStraus and\nEinstein\npublished\nA generalization of the relativistic theory of gravitation II\nin the\nAnnals of Mathematics\n. This presented a new derivation of the field equations which was necessary since the derivation in\nEinstein\n's single authored paper published in the previous year was based on an error. Straus submitted his doctoral thesis on\nEinstein\n's unified field theory to Columbia University and was awarded his doctorate in\n1948\n. He published\nSome results in\nEinstein\n's unified field theory\nin\n1949\nwhich was based on his thesis.\nStraus had been working with\nEinstein\non mathematical physics yet while at Princeton he had developed an interest in number theory from\nArtin\n,\nErdÅs\n,\nSelberg\nand\nSiegel\n. In fact Straus became a close friend of\nErdÅs\nand went on to write\n21\njoint papers with him over many years. When he went to the University of California at Los Angeles as an instructor in mathematics in\n1948\n, Straus therefore had already wide mathematical interests. Over the following years they would grow even wider as he contributed to a remarkable number of different areas of mathematics which include\n[\n3\n]\n:-\n... geometry, convexity, combinatorics, group theory and linear algebra.\nLet us illustrate with some examples of his work. In\n1949\nStraus collaborated with Richard Bellman publishing\nContinued fractions, algebraic functions and the PadÃ© table\nin which they gave a method for obtaining the rational approximants of\nFrobenius\n-\nPadÃ©\nfor power series expansions of algebraic functions. In\n1950\nhe published\nOn entire functions with algebraic derivatives at certain algebraic points\nand in the following year\nOn the polynomials whose derivatives have integral values at the integers\n. In\n1956\nhe published two papers with\nOlga Taussky-Todd\nin the\nPacific Journal of Mathematics\n. The first, with two additional coauthors, was\nOn the number of absolute points of a correlation\nand the next paper in the Journal was\nRemark on the preceding paper. Algebraic equations satisfied by roots of natural numbers\n. Let us note that Straus had a close association with the\nPacific Journal of Mathematics\nbeing on the editorial board from\n1951\nto\n1964\n, and being the managing editor between\n1954\nand\n1959\n.\nIn\n1956\n, in addition to the papers mention above, he published\nA characteristic property of the circle, ellipse, and hyperbola\nin the\nAmerican Mathematical Monthly\nwith\nPaul Kelly\n. This paper proves the converse of the fact that a conic has the same pedal curve with respect to either focus. Two years later Straus published\nCurvature in Hilbert geometries\nalso written jointly with\nKelly\n.\nHis joint work with\nMotzkin\n, which we referred to above, was on graph theory. Together they obtained some of the first results which went beyond\nTurÃ¡n\n's theorem on graphs containing no complete subgraphs. This work provided one of the foundations of extremal graph theory. Straus wrote\n21\njoint papers with\nErdÅs\n. Their work was again basic in developing a new theory, this time it was Euclidean Ramsey theory. In\nOn the maximal number of pairwise orthogonal Latin squares of a given order\n(1960)\nStraus, together with\nErdÅs\nand\nChowla\n, showed that the number of pairwise orthogonal Latin squares of order\nn\nn\nn\nis greater than\n(\n1\n/\n3\n)\nn\n1\n/\n91\n(1/3)n^{1/91}\n(\n1\n/\n3\n)\nn\n1\n/\n9\n1\n. This gave a lower bound than that found by R C Bose, E T Parker and S S Shrikhande when they disproved the\nEuler\nconjecture. An earlier joint paper by Straus and\nErdÅs\nwas\nOn linear independence of sequences in a Banach space\n(1953)\n.\nAnother combinatorics paper was\nOn a problem in the theory of partitions\n(1962)\n. In this Straus showed that for every positive integer\nn\nn\nn\n, there exists a set\nA\n(\nm\n,\nn\n)\nA(m,n)\nA\n(\nm\n,\nn\n)\nof positive integers such that\nn\nn\nn\nhas exactly\nm\nm\nm\npartitions into elements of\nA\n(\nm\n,\nn\n)\nA(m,n)\nA\n(\nm\n,\nn\n)\nfor every\nm\n,\n1\nâ¤\nm\nâ¤\np\n(\nn\n)\nm, 1 â¤ m â¤ p(n)\nm\n,\n1\nâ¤\nm\nâ¤\np\n(\nn\n)\n, where\np\n(\nn\n)\np(n)\np\n(\nn\n)\nis the number of partitions of\nn\nn\nn\n. In\n1971\nhis paper\nNonaveraging sets\ndiscussed sets of integers with the property that they contain no integer that is the average of any subset of size at least two.\nStraus died of a massive heart attack at the age of\n61\n.\nEarl A Coddington, Donald Kalish, and Robert Steinberg write in an obituary of their colleague:-\nAn encounter with Ernst, even a routine one such as at the departmental lunch table, was usually unforgettable. He moved effortlessly and brilliantly from scientific subjects to history, religion and politics, punctuating his talk with anecdotes and stories from his vast knowledge and experience.\nSimilar sentiments are expressed in\n[\n3\n]\n:-\nErnst Straus was not only a great mathematician, but also a great human being. ... His brilliance and enormous erudition in both humanities and science made a deep impression on all who were fortunate enough to know him. He could solve crossword puzzles in ink in English\n(\nhis third language\n)\nusing only the horizontal clues, and in the next minute discourse profoundly on relativity theory, European history, or theology. This intellectual power was combined with a deep and radiant humanity which made Ernst truly beloved by his colleagues, students, and friends. It was always a delight to visit his home, which was filled with mutually coexisting animals of all descriptions. It almost seemed that the animals had responded to his lifelong dedication to pacifism. Ernst worked tirelessly on behalf of men and women who were unjustly persecuted by their governments for speaking out in defence of freedom. He was extremely active in the anti-Vietnam war movement and, until the day before his death, he took an active part in efforts to bring about a nuclear freeze. Men of such great talent, uncompromising integrity, generosity, and gentlemen are among the world's rarest and most precious treasures."
