  "biografia": "C T Rajagopal\n's parents were Cadambathur Tiruvenkatacharlu and Padmamma. Cadambathur Tiruvenkatacharlu worked in the Revenue Department of the Madras State. C T Rajagopal\n(\nwe'll call him Rajagopal although he was known as CTR or Raju\n)\nhad two younger brothers and one sister, the youngest of the four siblings. Rajagopal's eldest brother was C T Venugopal\n(1907\n-\n1972)\n, known as Venu, who became an Indian civil servant who was recruited by the Indian Railway Accounts Service in\n1930\nand worked on the division of the assets of the railway when India and Pakistan became separate countries in\n1947\n. Rajagopal's younger brother was Cadambur Tiruvenkatachari Krishnamachari Chari\n(1909\n-\n1993)\nwho studied philosophy and became Head of the Department of Philosophy atÂ Madras Christian College. He wrote on the theory of relativity, quantum mechanics and the paranormal. Rajagopal's youngest sibling was Kamala who married R P Sarathy, who became the first defence secretary after India after the split with Pakistan.\nRajagopal was educated in Madras,Â\n(\nnow Chennai\n)\nÂ India, where he attended the Hindu High School. This school began in\n1860\nwhen two boys schools in the Triplicane area of Madras were merged. The name Hindu High School was adopted in\n1897\nafter a large new building was constructed. Rajagopal excelled in his studies at this school and, after his schooling was complete, he passed the Matriculation examination at Madras Presidency College in\n1919\n. This College, founded in\n1840\n, became part of the University of Madras when it was founded in\n1857\n. Rajagopal first followed the Intermediate Course and passed the Intermediate Examination in\n1921\nwith high marks. In the same year he began his study of the B.A. Honours Mathematics course but illness meant that he had to postpone taking the final examinations until\n1925\n. He graduated inÂ\n1925\nÂ from the Madras Presidency College with First Class Honours in mathematics.\nThe Professor of Mathematics at Madras Presidency College when Rajagopal studied there was K Ananda Rau\n(1893\n-\n1966)\nwho was an important influence on Rajagopal's mathematical development. Ananda Rau had studied at the University of Cambridge under\nG H Hardy\nwho wrote on\n26\nMarch\n1918\n[\n3\n]\n:-\nMr K A Rau has spent the last year in mathematical research, undertaken in part under my advice. Some of his results are contained in an essay which obtained the Smith's Prize this year; and he has done other valuable work which will no doubt be published in due course.\nAnanda Rau was appointed Professor of Mathematics at Madras Presidency College in July\n1919\n, the year in which Rajagopal began his studies at the College. M S Rangachari writes about Rajagopal's undergraduate studies in\n[\n5\n]\n:-\nIt was during the B.A.\n(\nHonours\n)\ncourse that he came into contact with K Ananda Rau, who was Professor of Mathematics in the Presidency College. The inspiration which Rajagopal got from Ananda Rau lasted throughout his life. In fact, there is an interesting parallel between the careers of these two men, which begins even earlier than their first contact, viz., their highly proficient studentship in the two renowned institutions, the Hindu High School and the Madras Presidency College. Ananda Rau could notice the exceptional intelligence of young Rajagopal. It is noteworthy that Tirukkannapuram Vijayaraghavan\n(1902\n-\n1955)\n, who influenced Rajagopal in his later career, was a senior college-mate in the Honours classes of Rajagopal.\nIn the year that he graduated,\n1915\n, Rajagopal married Rukmini; their only son was C R Srinivasan.\nRajagopal spent over a year in clerical service at the Madras Accountant General's office, and another year\n1930\n-\n31\nteaching in Annamalai University. This university had only been founded in\n1929\n. FromÂ\n1931\nÂ toÂ\n1951\n, he taught in the Madras Christian College. Here he gained an outstanding reputation as a teacher of classical analysis\n[\n5\n]\n:-\nIt is here that his lucid and often original exposition of classical mathematical analysis and his tender care for students, in which he was in full measure supported by his wife, Rukmini ..., won for him their everlasting admiration, affection and respect. He built a house at Tambaram according to his own design and settled down, as he thought at that time, and named his abode \"The Anchorage,\" teaching mathematics and doing research. Unlike many of Ananda Rau's students, Rajagopal started his research work late, some\n14\nyears after his graduation. His initial papers were a prelude to what he was to take up for research and reflected his original exposition of topics which he taught for the honours classes.\nIn fact his first paper,\nAn integral test for the convergence of a series of positive terms\n, was published in\nThe Mathematics Student\n. This journal of the\nIndian Mathematical Society\nhad been founded in\n1933\nand was, for many years, publishing material which promoted the teaching of mathematics. Rajagopal's first research level publications appeared in\n1937\n.\nFor a list of all of Rajagopal's publications, see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nInÂ\n1951\nÂ Rajagopal was persuaded to join theÂ\nRamanujan\nÂ Institute of Mathematics by Tirukkannapuram Vijayaraghavan who was the first Director of the Institute which had been founded in\n1950\nby Sir Alagappa Chettiar, an Industrialist and Philanthropist. Four years later, after the death of Vijayaraghavan, Rajagopal became the Director of the Institute. This only happened after leading mathematicians\nAndrÃ© Weil\n,\nRalph Boas\nand\nAntoni Zygmund\nhad been consulted and advised on Rajagopal's appointment. Rajagopal's task as Director was, however, a very difficult one\n[\n5\n]\n:-\n... the Institute passed through many a crisis and was often threatened with closure. That it survived those gloomy and agonising days was as much due to the high quality of mathematical activity generated by Rajagopal as it was to the indefatigable persistence, faith and hope with which he went on representing its cause to the authorities. ... when the fate of the Institute hung on the balance, the intervention by the famous astrophysicist Professor\nS Chandrasekhar\nmade the then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru make a recurring grant to the Institute and transfer its management to the University of Madras. The Institute retained its separate identity till\n1967\nwhen it became enlarged, with the University Department of Mathematics merging with it, to become the\nRamanujan\nInstitute for Advanced Study in Mathematics. Rajagopal's contribution to the Institute attaining the supreme position as one of the most important centres of mathematical research in India was immeasurable.\nIn\n1967\nRajagopal reached retirement age but his services were extended so that he could be continue as the Director of the extended Institute\n[\n5\n]\n:-\nHe finally retired from the Institute in June\n1969\nbut continued his research work with a small financial assistance through the Institute. It is no exaggeration to say that the Institute, as it stands today, is a monument to the unremitting efforts of Rajagopal as it is to the memory of\nSrinivasa Ramanujan\n. It is also true that the\nRamanujan\nInstitute is finding it difficult to face, with courage, the assessment of its achievements because of the void created by Rajagopal's retirement. The research work of the Institute was during Rajagopal's time, so productive and significant that his passing away has created a vacuum in the country among active, hard analysts, of whom he was perhaps the last.\nRajagopal studied sequences, series, summability. He publishedÂ\n89\nÂ papers in this area generalising and unifying Tauberian theorems.Â He also studied functions of a complex variable giving an analogue of a theorem ofÂ\nEdmund Landau\nÂ on partial sums ofÂ\nFourier\nseries. In several papers he studied the relation between the growth of the mean values of anÂ entire functionÂ and that of its\nDirichlet\nseries.\nA final topic to interest him was the history of medieval Indian mathematics\n[\n4\n]\n:-\nRajagopal took upon himself the task of establishing, to the satisfaction of mathematicians and mathematical historians, that the fundamentals of mathematical analysis were discovered and used in Kerala at least two centuries before\nNewton\nand\nLeibniz\n. He was assisted in this task by the late Prince Rama Varma of Cochin and his own students.\nHe showed that the series for\ntan\nâ¡\nâ\n1\nx\n\\tan^{-1}x\ntan\nâ\n1\nx\ndiscovered by\nGregory\nand those for\nsin\nâ¡\nx\n\\sin x\nsin\nx\nand\ncos\nâ¡\nx\n\\cos x\ncos\nx\ndiscovered by\nNewton\nwere known to the Hindus\n150\nyears earlier. He identified the Hindu mathematician\nMadhava\nas the first discoverer of these series.\nD T Whiteside\nin his\nMathematical Papers of Isaac Newton\n(\nCambridge,\n1968)\nwrites:-\nThese series for the sine and cosine, which here appear for the first time in a European manuscript, had, as we now know, already been displayed in a\n1639\nMalayalam compendium, the Yuktibhasa, which itself professes to be based on an early sixteenth-century Sanskrit original, the Tantrasangraha, perhaps the work of the little-known Hindu mathematician Nilakantha.\nRajagopal is described in\n[\n1\n]\nas follows:-\nRajagopal was a teacher par excellence and a reliable and inspiring research guide. No words can adequately describe his modesty. Rational thinking and interest in psychic studies were two attributes which he imbibed with pride from his teacher Ananda Rau.\nAfter he retired Rajagopal continued to undertake research both on summability and on medieval Kerala mathematics. In fact he published eighteen papers in the nine years of his retirement. He died of a \"massive heart attack and without pain\" in April\n1978\n[\n5\n]\n:-\nMany who knew C T Rajagopal could not believe that he was no more on\n25\nApril\n1978\n. He was so healthy and was so regular in habits that nobody could believe that destiny would snatch him away so soon. The end was painless and his wife who was by his side could not believe that he had left her. A medical man, who was called by her, when her beloved husband stopped responding to her enquiries, declared him to have succumbed to a \"massive heart-attack.\"\nM S Rangachari, the author of several of the biographies listed in the references below, was Rajagopal's student, then Rajagopal's colleague and collaborator. He writes a personal tribute in\n[\n5\n]\nof which we quote a part:-\nRajagopal was a teacher par excellence at any level, graduate, post-graduate or advanced. His teaching was marked by very detailed treatment of the topic, be it either real or complex analysis or statics or dynamics; it did not only adhere to the main text prescribed for the topic but covered additional ground throwing light on the teacher's original study of the topic. Thus he catered very well to the average students while inspiring the bright ones towards original work. ... As with his teacher, his way with research workers was to encourage and expect them to formulate their own problems and then to discuss the problems with them.\nThe author cannot forget the day when he was advised by Rajagopal to work on summability methods revising his own earlier suggestion to work in the theory of groups. It was the day when the author could generalise Rajagopal's results relating to Norlund summability. On the other hand, he was a very good collaborator who never distinguished his own contribution in a joint work from that of the others. Quite a few who were dedicated workers in other fields and who lacked support in their initial career were encouraged by Rajagopal. One such, Professor K Ramachandra, while unveiling the portrait of Rajagopal in the Ramanujan Institute could not suppress his emotion when he remembered the encouragement given to him by Rajagopal.\nIn the present day world of changing fashions in work in mathematics, Rajagopal never swerved from the principle of his revered teacher Ananda Rau, viz. to work in themes dear to us without caring for fads and fashions and to leave the assessment of the work to posterity.\n...\nRajagopal wrote well; whether it was his mathematical papers, or his articles on Christianity or psychic studies or reviews or notices, he was very careful in the choice of idiom and of precise expression. Each one of the many letters he wrote to the author is a piece of literature.\n...\nRajagopal was a believer in rational thinking. He did not take interest in religions rituals, but at the same time did not discourage others believing in them. During India's freedom struggle he demonstrated his nationalism by always wearing Khadi in response to the call of Mahatma Gandhi. About philosophy, unlike his friend Vijayaraghavan, he felt that every one should have his own philosophy. Vijayaraghavan's personal discussions with him about Visishtadvaita Philosophy and the Tamil songs of the Vaishnavite saints did not impress him. He more recently used to tell the author that he wished Vijayaraghavan were alive to discuss these matters with the author. On the other hand, Rajagopal believed in the scientific investigation of the so called supernormal and superhuman phenomena. He was quite proud of his views in this aspect, viz., what goes by the name of psychic research, and more particularly in the rebirth of the soul, and was happy that Srinivasa Ramanujan and Ananda Rau too had the same belief.\n...\nAs one who had immense faith in the knowledge of the Indian seers and saints, Rajagopal remarked that it was but natural that these ideas were found in our own scriptures. Rajagopal had a valuable collection of literature pertaining to psychic research. His lighter reading material was high class detective stories.\nRajagopal was an exemplary gentleman. Nobody, knowing him closely has ever heard him raising his voice. If he ever became angry, it was always in defence of his colleagues and students. The Rajagopals were highly hospitable. The author and some of his colleagues cannot forget the long hours spent at their home. There was always a stream of visitors to their house in Tambaram where each one of the visitors was personally welcomed and treated by Rajagopal and his gracious wife Rukmini."
