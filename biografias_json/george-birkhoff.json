  "biografia": "George Birkhoff\n's parents were David Birkhoff, who was a medical doctor, and Jane Gertrude Droppers. George was educated in Chicago where he was a student at the Lewis Institute from\n1896\nto\n1902\n. In\n1901\nhe began a correspondence with\nHarry Vandiver\non a problem in number theory. Together they studied the prime factors of\na\nn\nâ\nb\nn\na^{n} - b^{n}\na\nn\nâ\nb\nn\nand later wrote up their work for publication. Graduating from the Lewis Institute in\n1902\n, Birkhoff began his university education.\nHe entered the University of Chicago in\n1902\n, spending a year there, then moved to Harvard University where he studied from\n1903\nto\n1905\n. While at Harvard he submitted the results he had obtained with\nVandiver\nto the\nAnnals of Mathematics\nin\n1904\nand this joint number theory paper became his first publication. Also in\n1904\nhe submitted a paper on analysis to the\nAmerican Mathematical Society\n. During these two years at Harvard the teacher who influenced him most was\nBÃ´cher\nwho taught him algebra and classical analysis. Birkhoff was awarded his A.B. by Harvard in\n1905\nand his A.M. in\n1906\n.\nBirkhoff returned to the University of Chicago in\n1905\nto study for his doctorate. His research concentrated on asymptotic expansions,\nboundary value problems\n, and\nSturm\n-\nLiouville\ntype problems but his thesis advisor\nEliakim Moore\nappears to have been a less influential guide to Birkhoff than was\nPoincarÃ©\n. Birkhoff read\nPoincarÃ©\n's works on\ndifferential equations\nand celestial mechanics and he learnt more, and was more strongly influenced in the direction his research was taking, by\nPoincarÃ©\nthan from his supervisor. Archibald writes in\n[\n5\n]\n:-\nDuring his two years at Harvard, one in college and one in the graduate school,\nBÃ´cher\nand\nOsgood\nwere in their prime; but during the next two years\n[\nat Chicago\n]\nhe worked under\nEliakim Moore\n,\nBolza\nand\nMaschke\n, in the most inspiring mathematical center in the United States at that time. His dissertation was done quite independently however.\nThe doctoral thesis which Birkhoff submitted was entitled\nAsymptotic Properties of Certain Ordinary Differential Equations with Applications to Boundary Value and Expansion Problems\nand it led to the award of his Ph.D. in\n1907\n. It was an important thesis, not just for the results which it contained but also for the fact that the work had natural important extensions. Birkhoff himself developed the ideas further in the following years, as did two of his students, Rudolph Langer and\nMarshall Stone\n. For example Birkhoff and Langer published an important extension in\n1923\n. Birkhoff's work on linear differential equations,\ndifference equations\nand the generalised\nRiemann\nproblem mostly all arose from the basis he laid in his thesis.\nBirkhoff taught at the University of Wisconsin at Madison as an instructor from\n1907\nto\n1909\n. During this period, in fact in\n1908\n, he married Margaret Elizabeth Grafius; they had three children. After Wisconsin Madison, he went to Princeton as a preceptor in mathematics, becoming a professor there in\n1911\n. In the following year he moved to Harvard as an assistant professor, he was promoted to full professor there in\n1919\n, remaining at Harvard for the rest of his life. He was named Perkins Professor at Harvard in\n1932\n, then in\n1936\nhe became Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Science.\nBecause Birkhoff worked on so many different mathematical topics it is difficult to do justice to the range of his contributions in a biography of this length. However we should note that his main work was on dynamics and\nergodic theory\n. His ergodic theorem transformed the\nMaxwell\n-\nBoltzmann\nkinetic theory of gases into a rigorous principle through the use of\nLebesgue\nmeasure. Butler writes in\n[\n6\n]\n:-\nBirkhoff's discovery of what has come to be known as the \"ergodic theorem\" in\n1931\n-\n32\nis his most well-known contribution to dynamics. This theory, which resolved in principle one of the fundamental problems arising in the theory of gases and statistical mechanics, has been influential not only in dynamics itself but also in probability theory, group theory, and functional analysis.\nIt is, of course, not only the ergodic theorem that made Birkhoff the most famous mathematician in America in his day. He had already achieved this distinction in most mathematicians eyes many years earlier when he proved\nPoincarÃ©\n's Last Geometric Theorem, a special case of the\n3\n-body problem, in\n1913\n.\nPoincarÃ©\nhad stated his theorem in\nSur un thÃ©orÃ¨me de gÃ©omÃ©trie\nin\n1912\nbut could only give a proof in certain special cases. Birkhoff's proof in\n1913\nwas\n[\n1\n]\n:-\n.. one of the most exciting mathematical events of the era.\nThe foundations of relativity and\nquantum mechanics\nwere also topics which Birkhoff studied. Jointly with R E Langer, he published the monograph\nRelativity and Modern Physics\nin\n1923\n. Near the end of his life he published a more speculative work, combining his ideas on philosophy and science, in\nElectricity as a Fluid\nin\n1938\n. He also did important work on the\nfour colour theorem\n. He developed a mathematical theory of aesthetics which he applied to art, music and poetry. Before writing\nAesthetic measure\nhe spent a year travelling round the world studying art, music and poetry and various countries. This is referred to in\n[\n5\n]\n:-\nHe has told us that the formal structure of western music, the riddle of melody, began to interest him in undergraduate days; somewhat intense consideration of the mathematical elements here involved led him to apply his theory also to aesthetic objects such as polygons, tilings, vases, and even poetry.\nAmong his works, some of which we have already mentioned above, are\nRelativity and Modern Physics\n(1923)\n,\nDynamical Systems\n(1928)\n,\nAesthetic Measure\n(1933)\n, and\nBasic Geometry\n(1941)\n.\nIn\n1923\nthe\nAmerican Mathematical Society\nmade the first award of the\nBÃ´cher\nMemorial Prize to Birkhoff for his memoir,\nDynamical systems with two degrees of freedom\nwhich he had published in the\nTransactions of the American Mathematical Society\nin\n1917\n. He had a long association with the\nAmerican Mathematical Society\nbeing Vice-President in\n1919\n, Colloquium lecturer in\n1920\nwhen he lectured on\nDynamical Systems\n, he edited the\nTransactions of the American Mathematical Society\nfrom\n1921\nto\n1924\nand was President from\n1925\nto\n1926\n.\nPerhaps this high level of involvement with the\nAmerican Mathematical Society\nalready suggest that Birkhoff worked tirelessly to advance mathematics in America. In fact\nVeblen\ndescribed his efforts in this direct as \"a sort of religious devotion\". He realised, of course, that advancing mathematics in America meant having close contacts with advances in the rest of the world. His close contacts with mathematicians in Europe made him a natural person to write a report for the International Education Board on the state of mathematics in Europe. Among the European mathematicians his closest friends were\nHadamard\n, Niels NÃ¶rlund,\nLevi-Civita\n, and\nWhittaker\n.\nOf local interest in St Andrews is the fact that Birkhoff was one of the main speakers at the\n1926\nSt Andrews Colloquium and was elected an honorary member of the\nEdinburgh Mathematical Society\nin\n1927\n. He gave four lectures at the\nGregory\nTercentenary celebrations by the\nEdinburgh Mathematical Society\nin July\n1938\nand was awarded an honorary LL.D. by the University of St Andrews during his\n1938\nvisit. This was, in fact, one of thirteen honorary degrees which he received.\nOther honours which Birkhoff received include the Querini-Stampalia prize from the Royal Venice Institute of Science in\n1917\nfor his paper\nThe restricted problem of three bodies\npublished in\n1915\n, the annual prize from the American Association for the Advancement of Science in\n1926\n, and the biennial prize from the\nAccademia dei Lincei\nin Rome in\n1935\n. He was elected to the\nNational Academy of Sciences\n, the American Philosophical Society, the\nAmerican Academy of Arts and Sciences\n, the\nAcadÃ©mie des Sciences\nin Paris, the\nPontifical Academy of Sciences\n, the\nCircolo Matematico di Palermo\n, the\nRoyal Danish Academy of Sciences\nand Letters, the\nGÃ¶ttingen Academy\n, the Royal Institute of Bologna, the\nEdinburgh Mathematical Society\n, the\nLondon Mathematical Society\n, and the National Academy of Sciences of Lima, Peru. This is remarkable world-wide recognition for Birkhoff's outstanding contribution.\nThe article\n[\n5\n]\n, written shortly before his death, describes him as:-\n... by nature intensely social; through many trips to Europe, and circumnavigation of the globe, he has been extensively in contact with scholars throughout the world; he is a constant attendant and participant at meetings and congresses, and has been frequently in demand as a writer and speaker on popular themes. In recent administrative gatherings the originality and breadth of his views have been noteworthy.\nThere was, however, a negative side to Birkhoff's character which we should comment on.\nEinstein\nsaid:-\nG D Birkhoff is one of the world's great anti-Semites.\nIn a similar vein Chandler Davis, in a personal communication, writes:-\nG D Birkhoff was an early teacher of mine, and his son\nGarrett\nwas my\n(\nmuch appreciated\n)\nthesis supervisor. G D\n(\nbut not\nGarrett\n)\nwas consistently anti-Semitic, as shown in correspondence over the years; see R Phillips' article\n[\n15\n]\nand\nS Mac Lane\ncoming to Birkhoff's defence\n[\n11\n]\n. He systematically kept Jews out of his department, but apparently relented late in life and favoured appointing ONE by the\n1940\ns. He also helped some Jewish refugees find jobs NOT at Harvard in the\n1930\ns, while acting generally to hinder their entry. Though his record is mixed and some were more implacably anti-Semitic than he was, his actions in this regard are important because of his very great influence. However, it does not seem to be true\n(\nas rumoured credibly at the time\n)\nthat he opposed the appointment of\nOscar Zariski\nto his department. As I mentioned,\nGarrett\nwas not anti-Semitic at all.\nMac Lane\n[\n11\n]\n, defends Birkhoff by saying that whatever \"diffuse and varied versions of anti-Semitism\" Birkhoff may have had, they were undoubtedly shared by many of his contemporaries."
