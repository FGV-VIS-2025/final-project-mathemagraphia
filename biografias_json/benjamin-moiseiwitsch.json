  "biografia": "Benjamin Moiseiwitsch\nwas known as\nBenno\nto his friends and colleagues. His parents were Jacob Moiseiwitsch and Chana Kotlerman. Jacob and Chana Moiseiwitsch were Russians and their first child Daniel Moiseiwitsch was born in Russia in\n1919\n. The family moved to England and settled in Romford, Essex. They had two other children, Victoria, and Benjamin, the subject of this biography born in\n1927\n. Let us say a little about Daniel Moiseiwitsch at this point. He became an artist and has several pictures in the V&A Museum, London. In World War II he served with the\n1\nst Battalion of the Loyal Regiment\n(\nNorth Lancashire\n)\nin the Italian Campaign and died on\n24\nFebruary\n1944\nwhile fighting in the Battle of Anzio. Victoria was also an artist and she died in\n2012\n. As we will see below, although Benjamin became an applied mathematician, he also had an interest in art, in particular in the connections between art and mathematics.\nBenjamin grew up in Romford where he attended the Royal Liberty School, a grammar school in Upper Brentwood Road, founded in\n1921\n. Moiseiwitsch entered the school in\n1940\nand, after proving to be an outstanding pupil, graduated in\n1946\n. In that year he entered University College London where he studied mathematics and theoretical physics. There he was taught by, among others, Richard Arthur Buckingham\n(1911\n-\n1994)\nwho was a lecturer in mathematics,\nDavid Bates\nwho was also a lecturer in mathematics, and Harrie Stewart Wilson Massey\n(1908\n-\n1983)\n, a Australian mathematical physicist who held the Goldschmid Chair of Applied Mathematics. Massey had studied under\nRalph Fowler\nat the University of Cambridge and obtained a doctorate in\n1932\nwith his thesis\nThe Collision of Material Particles\n. Before both\nBates\nand Massey were called for war service,\nBates\nhad been a student of Massey's at Queen's University, Belfast, and had moved with him to University College London when Massey was appointed there in\n1938\n. One of Moiseiwitsch's fellow students, also interested in mathematics and theoretical physics, was Alexander Dalgarno\n(1928\n-\n2015)\n. When Moiseiwitsch began his studies at University College London it was only one year after the war had ended and everything was still in a poor state. The intense bombing had destroyed, or partially destroyed, many of the buildings and the Mathematics Department was in temporary dingy accommodation.\nMoiseiwitsch was awarded a B.Sc. from University College London in\n1949\nand continued studying there for a Ph.D. advised by Harrie Massey. Dalgarno was also working towards a Ph.D. advised by Massey and Buckingham. This strong group of researchers were interested in applying mathematics to atomic physics, molecular physics and atmospheric physics.\nIn\n1950\nMassey and Moiseiwitsch published\nThe Scattering of Electrons by Hydrogen Atoms\nin the\nPhysical Review\n. This short paper announced results which they stated would be published later in full and, indeed, in August\n1950\n, Massey and Moiseiwitsch submitted the paper\nThe Application of Variational Methods to Atomic Scattering Problems. I. The Elastic Scattering of Electrons by Hydrogen Atoms\nto the\nRoyal Society of London\n. It was published in the\nProceeding\nof that Society in the following year. It begins as follows:-\nVariational methods have proved to be of the greatest value for the approximate determination of the energies and wave functions for stationary states of various atomic and nuclear systems. In recent years ways have been found for extending such methods to unclosed states\n(\nstates of the continuous spectrum\n)\nwhich describe collision processes. This makes possible not only the rapid determination of the phase parameters describing the elastic scattering of particles by a centre of force, but also for the first time permits the inclusion of effects due to departure from the single-body approximation - effects such as arise from exchange of particles or from polarization. It therefore opens the way for a re-examination of the theory of the scattering of electrons by atoms which previously only made inadequate allowance for these effects. In this paper we consider the simplest problem of this kind - the elastic scattering of electrons by atomic hydrogen.\nIn\n1951\nBates\nleft the University College London group when he was appointed as Professor of Applied Mathematics at Queen's University, Belfast. Ray Flannery writes\n[\n1\n]\n:-\n[\nBates\n]\ncreated a supportive yet challenging environment at Queen's, and many came from all over the world to carry out research in atomic, molecular and atmospheric physics, under his inspiration and direction. To have built this world-class department within such a short time was no mean achievement. It required great intellectual might and vision, incredible leadership and insight, sustained dedication and loyalty.\nIn\n1952\nMoiseiwitsch graduated from University College London with a Ph.D. awarded for his thesis on quantum theory\nThe Application of Variational Methods To Collision Problems.\nIn the same year he joined\nBates\nas a Lecturer in Applied Mathematics at Queen's University, Belfast.\nOn\n20\nJune\n1953\nMoiseiwitsch married Sheelagh McKeon; they had four children: Tanya Moiseiwitsch\n(\nborn\n1954)\n, Lisa Moiseiwitsch, Julian Moiseiwitsch and Nicholas Moiseiwitsch\n(\nborn\n1968)\n. Julian Moiseiwitsch studied dental surgery at University College London and was awarded a Ph.D. from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He now works in Washington D.C. His wife FranÃ§oise Seillier-Moiseiwitsch is a mathematician. Nicholas Moiseiwitsch studied electronic engineering at the University of Southampton and became Head of Engineering Policy at the Institute of Electrical Engineers.\nMoiseiwitsch was promoted to Reader in Applied Mathematics at the Queen's University, Belfast in\n1962\nand Professor in Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics in\n1968\n. In\n1966\nhe published his textbook\nVariational Principles\n. The publisher gives the following description:-\nThis graduate-level text's primary objective is to demonstrate the expression of the equations of the various branches of mathematical physics in the succinct and elegant form of variational principles\n(\nand thereby illuminate their interrelationship\n)\n. Its related intentions are to show how variational principles may be employed to determine the discrete eigenvalues for stationary state problems and to illustrate how to find the values of quantities\n(\nsuch as the phase shifts\n)\nthat arise in the theory of scattering. Chapter-by-chapter treatment consists of analytical dynamics; optics, wave mechanics, and quantum mechanics; field equations; eigenvalue problems; and scattering theory.\nFor a version of Moiseiwitsch's Preface to this edition, also his Preface to the\n2004\nedition and an extract from a review of the\n1966\nedition, see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nIn\n1977\nhe published\nIntegral Equations\n. The publisher writes:-\nTwo distinct but related approaches hold the solutions to many mathematical problems - the forms of expression known as differential and\nintegral equations\n. The method employed by the integral equation approach specifically includes the boundary conditions, which confers a valuable advantage. In addition, the integral equation approach leads naturally to the solution of the problem - under suitable conditions - in the form of an infinite series. Geared toward upper-level undergraduate students, this text focuses chiefly upon linear integral equations. It begins with a straightforward account, accompanied by simple examples of a variety of integral equations and the methods of their solution. The treatment becomes gradually more abstract, with discussions of\nHilbert space\nand linear operators, the resolvent,\nFredholm\ntheory, and the\nHilbert\n-\nSchmidt\ntheory of linear operators in\nHilbert\nspace.\nJohn E G Farina, in the review\n[\n6\n]\n, writes:-\nThis book on integral equations is intended for students in the final year of an honours mathematics or mathematical physics course, but might also be useful to engineering students with a strong mathematical background. ... his is a very clearly written book. The author is careful to progress from the concrete to the abstract, so that first a good foundation of computational techniques is laid, followed by the more abstract aspects of the subject. He brings in new concepts gradually, and at the stage when the reader is ready for them. At the end of each chapter there is a set of straightforward, well chosen problems which should fall well within the scope of a reader who has understood the material of the chapter.\nMoiseiwitsch was elected to the\nRoyal Irish Academy\nin\n1969\n. He served as Dean of the Faculty of Science at Queen's University, Belfast, from\n1972\nto\n1975\nand head of the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics from\n1977\nto\n1989\n. He retired in\n1993\nand, at that time, was made professor emeritus.\nTwo projects by Moiseiwitsch after he retired are well worth mentioning. The first is his article\nArt, Mathematics, Music and the Physical Universe\nwhere he gives a truly fascinating account of the interrelations between the areas mentioned in the title. We give a version of his Introduction to this article at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nThe other major project he undertook after he retired was writing his book\nHow to Solve Applied Mathematical Problems\n(2011)\n. The publisher writes on the jacket of the book:-\nThe ability to solve problems in applied mathematics depends upon understanding concepts rather than memorizing formulas or rote learning. This volume bridges the gap between lectures and practical applications, offering students of mathematics, engineering, and physics the chance to practise solving problems from a wide variety of fields. The two-part treatment begins with chapters on vector algebra, kinematics, dynamics of a particle, vector field theory, Newtonian gravitation, electricity and magnetism, fluid dynamics, and classical dynamics. The second part examines\nFourier\nseries and\nFourier\nand\nLaplace transforms\n, integral equations, wave motion, heat conduction, tensor analysis, special and general relativity, quantum theory, and variational principles. The final chapter contains problems associated with many of the preceding chapters and expresses them in terms of the calculus of variations.\nA version of Moiseiwitsch's Preface is given at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nHe died unexpectedly at the age of\n89\n. His funeral was held at Roselawn Crematorium, Belfast, on Thursday\n22\nSeptember\n2016\n."
