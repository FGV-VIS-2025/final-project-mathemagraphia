  "biografia": "Ivan ÅleszyÅski\n's first name is sometimes written as 'Jan', which is the Polish version, while his last name is either given by the Polish 'ÅleszyÅski' or the Russian versions 'Sleshinskii' or 'Sleshinsky'. Although Ivan was born in Ukraine, he was ethnically Polish, being born into a Polish family living in Lysianka, a town about\n160\nkm due south of Kiev. He studied mathematics at Odessa University and graduated from there in\n1875\n. He then travelled to Germany where he studied under\nKarl Weierstrass\nat the University of Berlin, receiving his doctorate in\n1882\n. Returning to Odessa, he became professor of mathematics at the University, holding the position from\n1883\nto\n1909\n. The year\n1909\nwas significant in another way, for it was the one in which he published his translation of\nLouis Couturat\n's famous book\nThe algebra of logic\n. This work by ÅleszyÅski was more than a translation since it contained ÅleszyÅski's own very useful commentary. This text had a major influence on the development of mathematical logic in Russia since it became the main textbook used by students of the subject over many years.\nÅleszyÅski left Odessa and went to Poland in\n1911\nwhere he was appointed as an extraordinary professor at the Jagellonian University of KrakÃ³w. We should note that in fact KrakÃ³w was at this time in the Austro-Hungarian Empire but, remembering ÅleszyÅski's Polish background, it is fair to say that he was moving to Poland. In\n1919\nhe was promoted from extraordinary professor to become the full Professor of Logic and Mathematics the Jagellonian University. He continued to teach at KrakÃ³w until, having reached the age of seventy, he retired in\n1924\n. In fact we note that the university decided not to fill his chair after he retired.\nÅleszyÅski's main work was on continued fractions, least squares and axiomatic proof theory based on mathematical logic. In a paper of\n1892\n, based on his doctoral dissertation, he examined\nCauchy\n's version of the Central Limit Theorem using characteristic function methods, and made several significant improvements and corrections. Because of the work, he is recognised as giving the first rigorous proof of a restricted form of the Central Limit Theorem.\nIn\n1898\nAlfred Pringsheim\nproved that the condition\nâ£\nb\nn\nâ£\nâ¥\nâ£\na\nn\nâ£\n+\n1\n,\na\nn\nâ\n0\n,\nn\nâ¥\n1\n| b_{n} | â¥ | a_{n} | + 1, a_{n} â  0, n â¥ 1\nâ£\nb\nn\nâ\nâ£\nâ¥\nâ£\na\nn\nâ\nâ£\n+\n1\n,\na\nn\nâ\nî\nâ\n=\n0\n,\nn\nâ¥\n1\n,\nensures the convergence of the\ncontinued fraction\nK\n(\na\nn\nb\nn\n)\nK(\\Large\\frac{a_n}{b_n}\\normalsize)\nK\n(\nb\nn\nâ\na\nn\nâ\nâ\n)\n, where\na\nn\na_{n}\na\nn\nâ\nand\nb\nn\nb_{n}\nb\nn\nâ\nare complex numbers; a result now known as the\nPringsheim\ncriterion. W J Thron states in\n[\n6\n]\nthat this result was established ten years earlier by ÅleszyÅski. Thron demonstrates that\nPringsheim\nwas aware of ÅleszyÅski's work, though\nPringsheim\nhimself claims that he only became aware of ÅleszyÅski after his article was completed. Six papers by ÅleszyÅski on continued fractions are discussed in\n[\n6\n]\nwhere a complete bibliography of ÅleszyÅski's mathematical papers is given. His work on continued fractions is also discussed in\n[\n4\n]\n.\nIn\n[\n2\n]\nBednarowski discusses ÅleszyÅski's book\nO Logice Tradycyjnej\nâ\n(\nOn traditional logic\n)\npublished in KrakÃ³w in\n1921\n:-\nÅleszyÅski assumes that the part of traditional logic created by\nAristotle\nis a theory of relations which may hold between two classes. He then askes the following question. Having two non-empty classes A and B, what are the possible relations between them so far as having elements in common is concerned? His answer is that between A and B there holds one and only one of five relations which he symbolises by a, b, g, d, e.\nÅleszyÅski then represents the five different situations by using\nVenn\ndiagrams. In\na\na\na\nthe two classes\nA\nA\nA\nand\nB\nB\nB\ncoincide, in\nb\nb\nb\nthe class\nA\nA\nA\nis properly contained in\nB\nB\nB\n, in\ng\ng\ng\nthe class\nB\nB\nB\nis properly contained in\nA\nA\nA\n, in\nd\nd\nd\nthe classes\nA\nâ\nB\n,\nB\nâ\nA\nA - B, B - A\nA\nâ\nB\n,\nB\nâ\nA\n, and\nA\nA\nA\nintersect\nB\nB\nB\nare all non-empty, and in the final case\ne\n,\nA\ne, A\ne\n,\nA\nand\nB\nB\nB\nare disjoint. ÅleszyÅski then argues as follows. First he says that either\nA\nA\nA\nand\nB\nB\nB\nhave common elements or they do not. If they do not then we have the situation\ne\ne\ne\n. Next ÅleszyÅski looks at the situation where common elements exist. Either one of\nA\nA\nA\nor\nB\nB\nB\ncontains an element not in the other, or they do not. If they do not, then we have the situation\na\na\na\n. There remains the case where either one of\nA\nA\nA\nor\nB\nB\nB\ncontains an element not in the other. If\nA\nA\nA\nfails to contain an element not in\nB\nB\nB\nwe have\nb\nb\nb\n. Otherwise\nA\nA\nA\ncontains an element not in\nB\nB\nB\n. If also\nA\nA\nA\ncontains an element not in\nB\nB\nB\nthen\nd\nd\nd\notherwise\ng\ng\ng\n. ÅleszyÅski also goes on to consider what happens when empty classes are allowed and shows that three further relations occur.\nWe should mention another interesting work by ÅleszyÅski, namely\nOn the significance of logic for mathematics\n(\nPolish\n)\npublished in\n1923\n. However, despite the interesting publications we have mentioned, ÅleszyÅski did not publish much of his work. This was rectified by a major two-volume publication in the years following his retirement. One of ÅleszyÅski's most famous students at the Jagellonian University of KrakÃ³w was\nStanisÅaw Zaremba\n. In\n1925\nZaremba\n, acting as editor, published the first of two volumes of\nThe theory of proof\nbased on ÅleszyÅski's lectures at KrakÃ³w. A second volume appeared in\n1929\n. McCall writes in\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nMuch indeed can be learned from the rich collection of\n[\nÅleszyÅski's\n]\npapers on various subjects in the realm of formal logic, and of mathematical logic and its history ... Introduction to mathematical logic, complete proof, mathematical proof, exposition of the theory of propositions, the Boolean calculus,\nGrassmann\n's logic,\nSchrÃ¶der\n's algebra,\nPoretsky\n's seven laws,\nPeano\n's doctrine,\nBurali-Forti\n's doctrine - these are some of the themes pursued in this work, from which I personally have learned a great deal and thanks to which I have got a clear idea of many an unclear thing.\nWe end this brief biography by giving the following quote by ÅleszyÅski:-\nThe point of civilization is the exchange of ideas. And where is this exchange, if everybody writes and nobody reads?"
