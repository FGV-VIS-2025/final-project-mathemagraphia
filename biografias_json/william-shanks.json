  "biografia": "William Shanks\nmarried Jane Elizabeth Pringle\n(1815\n-\n1904)\nin London in\n1846\n. In\n1847\nhe moved to Houghton-le-Spring, a small town in the coal-mining area of County Durham.  We get more information about him from the census.\nIn\n1851\nhe was living at Quality Hill, Houghton-le-Spring, with his wife, his widowed mother-in-law Sarah Pringle, and a servant Jane Calbreath. Ten years later, in\n1861\n, he was living at a Private Boarding School in Nesham Place, Houghton-le-Spring, with his wife, mother-in-law, William Routledge\n(\nan English teacher\n)\n, Ann Oliver\n(\ncook\n)\n, Alice Oliver\n(\nhousemaid\n)\nand eleven pupils aged between\n7\nand\n18\n. In\n1871\nhe was still living at the school with his wife, Jane Monk\n(\ncook\n)\n, Catherine Potts\n(\nhousemaid\n)\nand eleven pupils aged between\n9\nand\n14\n. In\n1881\nhe was still living at Nesham Place, with his wife and Jane Shaw\n(\ndomestic servant\n)\n.\nShanks used his leisure hours working on mathematics, particularly on calculating the decimal expansion of Ï. He was influenced to undertake this task by William Rutherford from Edinburgh.\nIn\n1853\nShanks published a book entitled\nContributions to mathematics, comprising chiefly the rectification of the circle\n. In the same year William Rutherford gave\n440\ndecimal places in the expansion of Ï and, later in the same year, Shanks, in a collaboration with Rutherford, gave\n530\nplaces. This was a busy year for Shanks, for also in\n1853\nhe gave\n607\ndecimal places in the expansion of Ï which had been independently checked as correct to the first\n500\nof those places. At this point Shanks rested in his calculations of the decimal expansion of Ï, but he continued to write mathematical works. Between\n1854\nand\n1874\nShanks published nine mathematical memoirs in the\nProceedings\nof the\nRoyal Society of London\n.\nShanks is famed for his calculation of Ï to\n707\nplaces in\n1873\n, which, unfortunately, was only correct for the first\n527\nplaces. Despite these errors he did manage to correct some errors in the expansion of  to\n607\nplaces which he had given twenty years earlier. The method Shanks used in his calculation was based on the formula\nÏ\n4\n=\n4\ntan\nâ¡\nâ\n1\n(\n1\n5\n)\nâ\ntan\nâ¡\nâ\n1\n(\n1\n239\n)\n\\large\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\normalsize  = 4 \\tan^{-1}(\\large\\frac{1}{5}\\normalsize ) - \\tan^{-1}(\\large\\frac{1}{239}\\normalsize )\n4\nÏ\nâ\n=\n4\ntan\nâ\n1\n(\n5\n1\nâ\n)\nâ\ntan\nâ\n1\n(\n2\n3\n9\n1\nâ\n)\nwhich had been discovered by\nMachin\nin\n1706\nand used by him to correctly calculate  to\n100\ndecimal places.\nShanks also calculated\ne\ne\ne\nand\nEuler\n's constant Î³ to a great many decimal places. He published a table of\nprimes\nup to\n60\n,\n000\n, found the natural logarithms of\n2\n,\n3\n,\n5\nand\n10\nto\n137\nplaces, and the values of\n2\n12\nm\n+\n1\n2^{12m+1}\n2\n1\n2\nm\n+\n1\nfor\nm\n=\n1\n,\n2\n,\n3\n,\n.\n.\n.\n,\n60\nm = 1, 2, 3, ..., 60\nm\n=\n1\n,\n2\n,\n3\n,\n.\n.\n.\n,\n6\n0\n.\nIn\n1944\nD F Ferguson calculated Ï using the formula\nÏ\n4\n=\n3\ntan\nâ¡\nâ\n1\n(\n1\n4\n)\n+\ntan\nâ¡\nâ\n1\n(\n1\n20\n)\n+\ntan\nâ¡\nâ\n1\n(\n1\n1985\n)\n\\large\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\normalsize  = 3 \\tan^{-1}(\\large\\frac{1}{4}\\normalsize ) + \\tan^{-1}(\\large\\frac{1}{20}\\normalsize ) + \\tan^{-1}(\\large\\frac{1}{1985}\\normalsize )\n4\nÏ\nâ\n=\n3\ntan\nâ\n1\n(\n4\n1\nâ\n)\n+\ntan\nâ\n1\n(\n2\n0\n1\nâ\n)\n+\ntan\nâ\n1\n(\n1\n9\n8\n5\n1\nâ\n)\n.\nHe found that his value disagreed with that of Shanks in the\n528\nth\nplace. Ferguson discovered that Shanks had omitted two terms which caused his error. Of course calculating Ï to\n707\nplaces is now a trivial matter using a computer algebra package such as Maple. Shanks spent many long tedious days calculating; he would calculate new digits all morning and then he would spend all afternoon checking his morning's work. Now at a press of a button we get\n707\nplaces:\n3\n.\n14159265358979323846264338327950288419716939937510582097494459230781640628620899862803482534211706\n7982148086513282306647093844609550582231725359408128481117450284102701938521105559644622948954930381\n9644288109756659334461284756482337867831652712019091456485669234603486104543266482133936072602491412\n7372458700660631558817488152092096282925409171536436789259036001133053054882046652138414695194151160\n9433057270365759591953092186117381932611793105118548074462379962749567351885752724891227938183011949\n1298336733624406566430860213949463952247371907021798609437027705392171762931767523846748184676694051\n3200056812714526356082778577134275778960917363717872146844090122495343014654958537105079227968925892\n354201996\nShanks died in June\n1882\nand was buried at Houghton Hillside Cemetery on\n17\nJune."
