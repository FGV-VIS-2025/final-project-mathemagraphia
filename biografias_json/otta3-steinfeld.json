  "biografia": "OttÃ³ Steinfeld\nwas born into a Jewish family in Szarvas, a town BÃ©kÃ©s county in south eastern Hungary. He grew up in the town where he attended school showing what a talented young man he was. He was\n15\nyears old when World War II began but, since Hungary was allied to Germany, there was no invasion of the country. Steinfeld was able to continued his schooling. He was not allowed, however, to continue his studies at university despite his achievement since this was prevented by anti-Jewish laws. He could only obtain a job involving manual labour and he became an apprentice mason. He qualified as a mason before the German army invaded Hungary in March\n1944\n. Before this event the Hungarian government had discriminated severely against its Jewish citizens, both economically and politically, but they had largely been spared the concentration camps of the Nazis. After the German invasion, however, Dome Sztojay, a Nazi supporter, was installed as Hungarian prime minister and Hungarian Jews began to be deported to the gas chambers in concentration camps in Poland.\nSteinfeld was called up for military service in\n1944\nbut as a Jew he was considered an \"unreliable person\" and forced to work as a manual labourer in deplorable conditions. He spent a year working in desperate conditions during which time his health deteriorated markedly - he had severe problems with his kidneys and lungs. As a consequence he had health problems for the rest of his life. During this time he learnt that his parents had died in a concentration camp where they had been taken under the new policy of Dome Sztojay.\nSoviet troops entered Hungary in September\n1944\nand until April\n1945\nthe country became a battlefield, sacked both by retreating German troops and by advancing Soviet troops. After the war ended Steinfeld was able to attend university. He entered Szeged University in\n1945\nwhere he studied mathematics and physics. He was particularly attracted to algebra by the lectures of\nLÃ¡szlÃ³ RÃ©dei\n. After graduating with his diploma in\n1950\n, he was offered a post as an assistant at Szeged University. He taught at Szeged while working for his Candidate's degree under the guidance of\nRÃ©dei\n. During this period\nRÃ©dei\nwas working on ideas that he published in\nDie Holomorphentheorie fÃ¼r Gruppen und Ringe\nâ\n(\nThe Holomorphism theory for groups and rings\n)\n(1954)\n. Basically he was seeking appropriate analogues in ring theory for certain concepts used in the theory of groups and he did this by looking at the corresponding notions in semigroups. It is interesting that most of Steinfeld's research went in the other direction for he often took ideal theoretic properties of rings and looked for analogues in semigroup theory, semiring theory, or the theory of partially ordered algebraic structures.\nIn\n1955\nSteinfeld was awarded his Candidate's degree, and the following year he left Szeged to take up an appointment in the Mathematical Institute of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences in Budapest. He was awarded a D.Sc. in\n1969\nand, two years later, became Head of the Department of Algebra of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. He held this position until\n1982\nwhen, at the age of\n58\n, he was forced to retire due to ill health.\nIn\n[\n1\n]\nMÃ¡rki lists\n65\npublications by Steinfeld. His early publications, while he was working for his Candidate's degree, were\nBemerkung zu einer Arbeit von L KalmÃ¡r\nâ\n(\nRemark on a paper by L Kalmar\n)\n(1951)\n,\n(\nwith\nL RÃ©dei\n)\nÃber Ringe mit gemeinsamer multiplikativer Halbgruppe\nâ\n(\nOn rings with common multiplicative semigroup\n)\n(1952)\n,\nÃber die Nullteilerfreiheit von Ringen\nâ\n(\nOn the zero divisor freedom of rings\n)\n(1942)\n,\nRemark on a paper of N H McCoy\n(1953)\n, and\nOn ideal-quotients and prime ideals\n(1953)\n. In this last mentioned paper Steinfeld introduced the concept of a quasi-ideal. This was a concept which he continued to develop throughout his career. The paper also considers applications of ideal theory in rings to Schreier extension theory in groups in the same spirit as\nRÃ©dei\n's paper\nHolomorphentheorie fÃ¼r Gruppen und Ringe\nâ\n(\nThe Holomorphism theory for groups and rings\n)\n(1954)\nwhich we mentioned above. Much of Steinfeld's contributions to quasi-ideals is contained in his monograph\nQuasi-ideals in rings and semigroups\n(1978)\n. H J Weinert, in a review of the book, notes that Steinfeld introduced the notion of a quasi-ideal in\nOn ideal-quotients and prime ideals\n(1953)\nand since then:-\n... results on those quasi-ideals have been published in more than fifty papers, showing the fruitfulness of this notion, particularly in revealing similarities and differences between rings and semigroups. The main part\n(\nabout\n100\npages\n)\nof this excellent book gives a systematic and self-contained survey on this subject.\nOther topics on which Steinfeld undertook research included the structure of simple artinian rings, for example in\nSome characterizations of semisimple rings with minimum condition on principal left ideals\n, and analogues in other algebraic systems. His article\nÃber die Verallgemeinerungen und Analoga der Wedderburn-Artinschen und Noetherschen StruktursÃ¤tze\nâ\n(\nOn the generalizations and analogues of Wedderburn-Artin and Noether structure sets\n)\n(1967)\ndiscussed generalizations of the\nNoether\nand\nWedderburn\n-\nArtin\ncharacterizations of the semi-simple and simple Artinian rings to\nF\nF\nF\n-rings, to the\nM\nH\nL\nMHL\nM\nH\nL\n-rings, for semi-simple linear compact rings, for semirings, for semi-simple near-rings, and for semi-groups which are unions of completely\n0\n-simple. In the paper\n(\nwith\nL RÃ©dei\n)\nEiniges Ã¼ber Gruppoid-VerbÃ¤nde mit Anwendungen auf Gruppen, Ringe, Halbgruppen\nâ\n(\nOn groupoid associations with applications for groups, rings, semigroups\n)\n(1974)\nthe authors generalise concepts from groups, rings, and semigroups to groupoid lattices. Steinfeld  was also much interested in primness, including prime ideals and prime elements in partially ordered semigroups. An example of a paper on this topics is\n(\nWith\nL Fuchs\n)\nPrincipal components and prime factorization in partially ordered semigroups\n(1963)\n. J A H Shepperd writes:-\nTwo new sets of conditions are obtained for unique prime factorisation in a partially ordered semigroup\n(\nnot necessarily commutative\n)\n, generalising the fundamental theorem or commutative ideal theory. The concept of principal component is introduced and its properties are studied.\nMÃ¡rki, in\n[\n1\n]\n, describes Steinfeld's character:-\nOttÃ³ Steinfeld was a man with high moral standards. When important matters were at stake, he always tried to disregard not only his personal interests but even his social attachments. He was full of good intentions, always ready to help and protest against injustice, even in times and cases when such actions meant a danger to himself. Anyone who really got to know him could not help loving him."
