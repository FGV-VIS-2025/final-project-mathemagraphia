  "biografia": "Joram Lindenstrauss\nwas the son of Bruno Lindenstrauss and Ilse Stammreich. Bruno Lindenstrauss\n(1908\n-\n1968)\n, born in Berlin on\n25\nJanuary\n1908\n, was a lawyer and his wife Ilse Stammreich\n(1903\n-\n2000)\n, born in Berlin on\n19\nAugust\n1903\n, was also a lawyer. When the Nazis came to power in Germany in\n1933\nwith their extreme anti-Semitic policies, the Jewish couple Bruno and Ilse Lindenstrauss emigrated to Palestine. We note that Ilse Lindenstrauss wrote\nOn women's law in Israel\n, which was published in Tel-Aviv by the Women's International Zionist Organisation, Instruction and Information Centre in\n1949\n. Joram was their only son, attending school in Tel Aviv.\nLindenstrauss began his studies in mathematics at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in\n1954\n. At this stage he was only a part-time student for he was also undertaking his compulsory military service. After spending two years with only part-time study, in\n1956\n, with his military service completed, he became a full-time student. He received his Master's degree from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in\n1959\nand continued to study there for his Ph.D. advised by\nAryeh Dvoretzky\nand\nBranko GrÃ¼nbaum\n. His first publication, which appeared in the Bulletin of the Research Council of Israel Section F, was\nOn some subspaces of\nl\n1\nl^{1}\nl\n1\nand\nc\n0\nc_{0}\nc\n0\nâ\n. This was published in\n1961\nwhile he was still working on his thesis.\nHe submitted his thesis\nExtension of Compact Operators\nto the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and was awarded his Ph.D. in\n1962\n. The main results of his thesis appeared in a number of places. He announced the results in Technical Note No.\n22\n(\nJerusalem,\n1961)\nand in a modified form in his note\nOn the Extension Property for Compact Operators\n(1962)\nin the\nBulletin\nof the\nAmerican Mathematical Society\n. In this note he acknowledged that:-\nThe research reported in this note has been sponsored in part by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research of the Air Research and Development Command U.S. Air Force through its European Office.\nHe also writes:-\nThis note is based on a part of a Ph.D. thesis which was written under the supervision of Professor\nA Dvoretzky\nand Dr\nB GrÃ¼nbaum\n. I wish to express my warm thanks to both for their valuable help and kind encouragement.\nProofs of the results stated in the paper appear in his thesis and also in\nThe\nExtension of Compact Operators\nI, II, III\n, Technical Notes Nos.\n28\n,\n31\n,\n32\n(\nJerusalem,\n1962)\n.\nWhile studying at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Lindenstrauss met Naomi Zelinger; they married and had four children Ayelet, Elon\n(\nborn\n1970)\n, Kinneret\n(\nborn\n1972)\n, and Gallia. Ayelet Lindenstrauss Larsen and Elon Lindenstrauss both became mathematicians, Ayelet is Professor of Mathematics at Indiana University, Bloomington, while Elon achieved the highest mathematical award when he was awarded the\nFields\nMedal in\n2010\n. Kinneret Lindenstrauss Keren is a biophysicist, at Technion winning the Krill prize for Scientific Research from the Wolf Foundation in\n2010\n, while Gallia is a researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies at Tel Aviv University.\nAfter the award of his Ph.D. Lindenstrauss spent three years in the United States, first at Yale University and later at the University of Washington in Seattle, working there between\n1962\nand\n1965\n. He entered the United States on\n26\nAugust\n1962\nwith his wife, having flown on a Pan Am flight from London. His daughter Ayelet writes\n[\n4\n]\n:-\nThe boy who grew up in Israel and left it for the first time after completing his PhD never ceased to marvel at being a member of the international fellowship of mathematics.\nDuring his time in the United States wrote many papers.\nSome results on the extension of operators\nappeared in\n1963\n, and in it he notes that it is closely related to work in his thesis. He thanks\nShizuo Kakutani\n, who was on the faculty of Yale:-\n... for many valuable discussions concerning the subject of this note.\nLindenstrauss also thanks\nShizuo Kakutani\nfor \"valuable discussions\" concerning\nOn a problem of Nachbin concerning extension of operators\n, also published in\n1963\n. His paper\nOn operators which attain their norm\n(1963)\nwas written after \"valuable discussions\" with Robert Ralph Phelps\n(1926\n-\n2013)\nwho had been appointed to the University of Washington in\n1962\n. Lindenstrauss published two further papers in\n1963\nand seven in\n1964\n, one of which was\nOn nonlinear projections in Banach spaces\n(1964)\n[\n6\n]\n:-\nIn this work he proved theorems that exhibit remarkable, and arguably unexpected, rigidity phenomena for\nBanach\nspaces when they are deformed by uniformly continuous\n(\nor Lipschitz\n)\nmappings.\nHis\n2\n-page paper\nA short proof of Liapounoff's convexity theorem\n(1966)\nhas led to this beautiful proof becoming standard in functional analysis texts as well as becoming important for further developments of the topic. We note that by\n1966\n, Lindenstrauss had published around\n30\npapers, a truly remarkable achievement for someone\n30\nyears of age.\nLindenstrauss left the United States and, back in Israel in\n1965\n, he became a senior lecturer at the  Hebrew University and worked at the\nEinstein\nInstitute of Mathematics. Yoav Benyamini writes\n[\n4\n]\n:-\nIn\n1965\nJoram Lindenstrauss joined the Hebrew University as a new faculty, and I was a third-year undergraduate student sitting in his\nBanach\nSpaces course. This first encounter set the course of my life. The\nBanach\nspace group in Jerusalem began with\nDvoretzky\n, who was joined by his former student\nGrÃ¼nbaum\nand their students. A phase transition occurred with the arrival of Joram, who joined\nDvoretzky\nin the supervision of the doctoral theses of Lazar and Zippin, and Joram's influence dominated their work. ... I started to work with him on a master's thesis in\n1966\n. Joram gave excellent basic and advanced courses, and within a few years the list of his students grew very fast ... Joram's supervision style was very \"open.\" We did not have orderly weekly meetings, and he never gave me a problem for the thesis. The exposure to the different directions and problems came through his comments and criticism in the seminar and other discussions. This is also how I learned how to judge what is \"important,\" \"interesting,\" what is worthwhile to read, and what is publishable. His approach and views were so dominant that he was \"heard\" even when he was not present. Joram was very systematic and methodical. His answers to questions sounded like he had prepared a lecture on the subject. He did not like to discuss speculations: he would send me to write up my ideas and, of course, in most cases the speculation led nowhere. But when I did hand him something in writing, he was a wonderful reader. It would come back the next day with detailed feedback. He was also a wonderful writer, and his papers, books, and lecture notes\n(\nin Hebrew\n)\nare written in his typical systematic, clear, and concise style.\nLindenstrauss was promoted to associate professor in\n1967\nand to full professor in\n1969\n. He was named Leon H and Ada G Miller Memorial Professor of Mathematics in\n1985\n.\nWilliam B Johnson writes in\n[\n4\n]\n:-\nIn the\n1970\ns Joram's family spent several summers in Columbus\n(\nI was at Ohio State then\n)\n, and my family spent one year in Jerusalem. In\n1981\n-\n82\nboth families were in College Station, where Joram and I took our sabbaticals and Joram's wife, Naomi, worked on her PhD in computer science. Our wives became close friends and our children grew up together. Once when we went for Shabbat dinner at the Lindenstrauss home, Joram, with some help from Ayelet and Elon, built a Lego city in their living room. Our son was always happy to return to \"Joram's toy store.\" Later I was a coach of a soccer team on which my son and Joram's daughter played, and I played basketball with Kinneret and some of her boy friends. Kinneret, now well known in the biophysics community, was the best player on the court and had a successful second career as a professional basketball player. Shabbat dinners at the Lindenstrauss home after our children were grown were particularly enjoyable when some of their children were present. It was great to get to know the adult Gallia, the youngest and most widely read of the Lindenstrauss clan\n(\nGoogle her to find out why\n)\n, who was often present helping Naomi with the preparations.\nLindenstrauss published the lecture notes\nClassical Banach spaces\n(1973)\nwhich he wrote jointly with Lior Tzafriri. The authors write in the Preface:-\nThe main purpose of these lecture notes is to give an outline of that part of\nBanach\nspace theory which deals with properties of special and important classes of spaces. We have tried to present the main methods used in the theory, as well as the principal ideas involved in the proofs of the basic results. The lecture notes contain some well known and classical theorems but the main subject matter consists of recent results and research directions. Many open problems are mentioned throughout these notes.\nGrahame Bennett writes in the review\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nBanach\nspace theory has seen considerable change in recent years and these excellent lecture notes provide a highly readable and up-to-date survey of this area.\nThe two authors expanded their lecture notes into two volumes\nClassical Banach spaces. I. Sequence spaces\n(1977)\nand\nClassical Banach spaces. II. Function spaces\n(1979)\n. The authors write in the first of these volumes:-\nThe purpose of this book is to present the main results and current research directions in the geometry of\nBanach\nspaces with an emphasis on the study of the structure of the classical\nBanach\nspaces, that is\nC\n(\nK\n)\nC(K)\nC\n(\nK\n)\nand\nL_{p}(\\mu)\nand related spaces. We do not attempt to write a comprehensive survey of\nBanach\nspace theory, or even only of the theory of classical\nBanach\nspaces, since the amount of interesting results on the subject makes such a survey practically impossible. A part of the subject matter of this book appeared in outline in our lecture notes\n(1973)\n. In contrast to those notes most of the results presented here are given with complete proofs. We therefore hope that it will be possible to use the present book as a textbook on\nBanach\nspace theory and as a reference book for research workers in the area. It contains much material which was not discussed in the earlier version\n(1973)\n, a large part of which is the result of very recent research work. An indication of the rapid recent progress in\nBanach\nspace theory is the fact that most of the many problems stated in the earlier book have been solved by now.\nThe authors of\n[\n6\n]\ngive the following overview of Lindenstrauss's achievements:-\nA deep, original, clever and prolific mathematician, Joram Lindenstrauss ... was a pillar of modern functional analysis and an enormously influential champion of a tradition of excellence and uncompromising\n(\nat times, even harsh\n)\npursuit of the highest possible quality of mathematical research. In addition to proving difficult theorems and solving longstanding open problems, Joram was a conceptual leader who was responsible for the formulation of foundational insights and major research directions that guided and shaped the intensive efforts of many researchers worldwide over several generations, and his legacy will undoubtedly continue to do so in the future.\nElon Lindenstrauss writes in\n[\n4\n]\nabout his father:-\nMy father was very honest, had high standards both for himself and for others, and always said exactly what he thought, regardless of whether what he thought was pleasant or unpleasant to hear. From the time I was a graduate student to the last talks of mine which he attended when I was already a well-established researcher, I was always especially nervous and tried to be very well prepared when giving a talk when he was in the audience, as I was sure I would be told afterwards exactly what he thought of the talk.\nDavid Preiss writes about interests of the Lindenstrauss family outside mathematics\n[\n4\n]\n:-\nI recall a number of non-mathematical events, such as playing basketball on a team opposing him\n(\nhe was very good\n)\n, going to concerts, his daughter Gallia's pictures of Jerusalem, walks in Jerusalem, exhibitions, and of course his welcoming family and the huge amount of help we were given by his wife, Naomi.\nGideon Schectman writes about Lindenstrauss's influence on him\n[\n4\n]\n:-\nWhat really set him apart from the point of view of his influence on me were the standards he set and lived by. He had very high standards as to what constitutes good mathematics and for scientific and personal integrity. These were also very easy to absorb from him: he always said what was on his mind whether asked for it or not.\nLindenstrauss retired in\n2005\n, having had poor health for some time, and after several years of deteriorating health he died in April\n2012\n.\nLindenstrauss received many honours for his outstanding mathematical contributions. He gave an invited lecture at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Nice in September\n1970\n. He won the Israel Prize in Mathematics in\n1981\nand was elected as a member of the\nIsrael Academy of Sciences\nin\n1986\n. In\n1997\nhe was the first non-Polish mathematician to receive the\nBanach\nMedal from the\nPolish Academy of Sciences\n. In\n2000\nhe was elected to the\nAustrian Academy of Sciences\nand in\n2001\nhe received an honorary doctorate from Kent State University in Ohio."
