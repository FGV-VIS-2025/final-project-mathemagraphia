  "biografia": "Daniel da Silva\n's parents were Roberto JosÃ© da Silva\n(\n?-\n1866)\nand Maria do Patrocinio. Daniel was baptised in the Lisbon parish of Our Lady of the Martyrs on\n19\nSeptember\n1814\n. He was the second of his parents' children, having an older brother Carlos Bento da Silva\n(1812\n-\n1891)\nwho went on the become a government minister in charge of various offices such as the Treasury, Public Works, Public Instruction, the Navy, and Foreign Affairs.\nWe note that da Silva grew up in Portugal at a time when the country suffered civil wars. In\n1820\n, when da Silva was six years old, there was an uprising in the country. A more major revolution took place in the early\n1830\ns causing the closure of courses at the University of Coimbra. It is certainly the case that da Silva's education took place against a difficult background of tensions and war in the country.\nIn\n1829\n, at the age of fifteen, da Silva entered the Portuguese Royal Academy of Midshipmen in Lisbon. This university naval academy had been founded in\n1792\nbut the Lisbon Academy ceased to exist after Napoleon invaded Portugal in\n1807\n. It was reestablished in Lisbon in\n1823\n, only six years before da Silva began studying there. At the Royal Academy of Midshipmen he took mathematics courses on Arithmetic, Geometry, Algebra, Plane and Spherical Trigonometry, Differential and Integral Calculus. He also took courses on Mechanics such as Astronomy, Dynamics, Hydrostatics, Hydraulics and Optics. Obviously, given that this was a naval academy, he also studied navigation. In addition, he attended courses at the Lisbon Royal Naval Observatory which had been established to give cadets practical observing experience.\nDa Silva showed that he was a very able mathematician and won prizes during his first two years of study for his excellent performance in the Mathematics Courses. He was awarded a distinction in each of the three years. He also performed well in the Observatory courses on the use of instruments and on astronomical calculations. The next step in educational route he was following was to move to the Royal Academy of Marine Guards. To enter this Academy a student had to be the son of the titled nobility, the son of a senior naval officer or award winning student from the Royal Academy of Midshipmen. Da Silva did not qualify under the first two criteria, but could have entered in\n1832\n, after three years of study at the Royal Academy of Midshipmen, because of his excellent performance. However, he chose to wait a year and applied for admission on\n12\nAugust\n1833\n. Accepted on\n28\nAugust he then served as a commercial clerk for two months before beginning his studies at the Royal Academy of Marine Guards at the end of October\n1833\n. He attended classes in Artillery, Naval Architecture and Operating equipment. In addition he had practical experience of seamanship on ships which travelled along the Portuguese coast and also made voyages to the Azores and Madeira.\nOn\n17\nAugust\n1835\n, da Silva applied for leave from the Royal Academy of Marine Guards so that he might attend the Mathematics Course at the University of Coimbra. These courses had been closed for some time because of the civil war, but they had reopened in\n1834\nafter Liberalism had been established in the country which led to various educational reforms. Permission was granted on\n4\nSeptember\n1835\nfor da Silva to take leave to attend the University of Coimbra but, in November\n1835\n, the new Liberal government proposed to set up an Institute of Physical and Mathematical Sciences in Lisbon. Da Silva applied for admission to this new Institute on the grounds that it would be much more convenient to be able to study advanced mathematics courses while in Lisbon. However, despite the Liberal government's initiative for this new Institute in Lisbon, the project never got off the ground and it was cancelled on\n2\nDecember. Da Silva reverted to his original plan and enrolled in the Faculty of Mathematics at the University of Coimbra. Again da Silva was awarded prizes for his achievements in the mathematics courses and was awarded a Bachelor's Degree in Mathematics from the Faculty of Mathematics of the University of Coimbra at the age of twenty-five in\n1839\n.\nAfter graduating, da Silva applied for a teaching position in the Polytechnic School of Lisbon. This Polytechnic School had been founded in\n1837\nwith the aim of providing a scientific training for young men who were aiming at a career in the army of navy. When founded, it replaced the Royal Academy of the Navy. The post was to be filled by competition but, for some reason, the competition never took place. For the next few years da Silva followed a naval career. He was promoted to Brigadier of the\n2\nnd Brigade on\n18\nJanuary\n1840\n, and, later that year, to Second Lieutenant of the Navy on\n26\nNovember.\nThe Sociedade Escholastico-Philomatica of Lisbon was founded in\n1839\n. The Society put on public courses, organised philosophical discussions and published a\nJournal\n. Many of the leading politicians and academics were members of the Society and, from\n1843\n, da Silva was associated with it. In March\n1844\nhe was appointed examiner for the chair of Artillery, Geography and Hydrography at the Royal Academy of Marine Guards in Lisbon. In the following year the Royal Academy of Marine Guards was renamed the Naval School but continued to operate from buildings in Terreiro do PaÃ§o in Lisbon training officers for the Portuguese Navy. Da Silva became a substitute lecturer at the Naval School in\n1845\n. From\n1845\nto\n1848\nhe taught Mechanics, Spherical Trigonometry, Nautical Astronomy, Optics, Use of Instruments, and Practical Astronomical Observations. From\n1848\nto\n1852\n, he held the chair which taught \"Theoretical and Practical Artillery\", \"Principles of Provisional Fortification\", \"Geography\" and \"Hydrography\". His health was not good and he had to take periods away from teaching due to these problems. He was promoted to First Lieutenant of the Navy in\n1851\nbut in\n1852\nhis health problems became so severe that he applied for leave to go to Madeira where he hoped he would recover. From\n1851\nto\n1859\nhe seems to have been unable to carry out his duties due to his poor health and on\n12\nJuly\n1859\nthe Naval Health Board classed him \"unfit for active duty.\" In fact da Silva published a Memoir in\n1854\n, which he had read to the\nRoyal Academy of Sciences of Lisbon\nin\n1852\n, but the publisher added a note which\n[\n9\n]\n:-\n... stated that da Silva had been seriously ill for a long time, so for that reason he had been able to revise neither the preface nor the final part\n(\nfrom page\n117\nonwards\n)\nof his memoir. For the same reason the last two chapters are incomplete: in the ninth some theorems are missing he would like to have added; and he was only able to write an abstract of the intended contents of the tenth chapter.\nBy\n1859\nthere appears to have been a small improvement in his health and, on the\n16\nApril of that year, he married Zefferina d'Aguiar\n(1825\n-\n1913)\nfrom the town of Funchal. They had one child, a son JÃºlio Daniel da Silva who was born in\n1866\n. Sadly he died aged\n25\nin\n1891\n.\nDa Silva does not appear to have been well enough to teach between\n1852\nand\n20\nOctober\n1965\nwhen he retired as a lecturer. He continued to hold his naval positions until\n31\nDecember\n1868\nwhen he retired from the Navy. Once retired, da Silva's health improved a little and he taught some courses at the University of Coimbra. There he taught and strongly encouraged the young student\nGomes Teixeira\n. In\n[\n1\n]\nTeixeira\nwrites:-\n[\nDa Silva\n]\nlived in a perpetual struggle with a disease which would not allow him to give as much as he wanted to the science of his predilection.\nMost of da Silva's mathematical contributions were made during the years when he was forced to give up teaching because of ill health. His publications begin in\n1851\nwith his first Memoir and continued until\n1878\n, the year of his death. We should now say a little about these mathematical contributions. Three important memoirs by da Silva are discussed by\nGomes Teixeira\nin\n[\n1\n]\n. These are\nTransforming and reducing couples of forces\n(1851)\n,\nMemoir on the rotation of forces on their application points\n(1851)\nand\nGeneral properties and direct resolution of binomial congruences. Introduction to the study of number theory\n(1854)\n. Concerning the first of these\nTeixeira\nwrites:-\nDaniel's Memoir, to which we are referring, concerns the theory of couples, a theory which our geometer has simplified in many points, and especially in the part concerning the decomposition of couples, which others placed in planes using oblique coordinates, employing for this a new geometric representation of these groups of forces.\nThis Memoir, although interesting, only gives alternative proofs of results already in the literature. The second of his Memoirs, however, is a more important work which presents an original approach to problems posed by da Silva himself. In this Memoir\n[\n1\n]\n:-\n... the author revealed himself for the first time as a mathematician of great merit, he shows how the effects of the forces applied to a body vary, when these forces revolve around their points of application, while preserving as constant the angles they make between themselves, and determines the various particular circumstances that accompany this change in orientation of the same forces.\nThese results by da Silva did not reach an international audience. Over twenty years later, in\n1877\n,\nGaston Darboux\nproved\n(\nindependently\n)\nthe same results in his paper\nMÃ©moire sur l'Ã©quilibre astatique et sur l'effet que peuvent produire des forces de grandeurs et de directions constantes appliquÃ©es en des points dÃ©terminÃ©s d'un corps solide, quand ce corps change de position dans l'espace\nâ\n(\nMemory on astatic equilibrium and on the effect produced by forces of constant magnitudes and directions applied at determined points of a solid body, when this body changes its position in space\n)\n. When da Silva saw that his priority had not been recognised, he was upset since he knew that the journal in which his paper had appeared was taken by the\nParis Academy of Sciences\n. He wrote a letter \"RÃ©clamation de PrioritÃ©\" to the editor of\nDeux Mondes\nbut, as Luis Manuel Ribeiro Saraiva writes in\n[\n9\n]\n:-\nThis seems to have been a bad decision, as the newspaper was not widely read, and therefore da Silva's work remained unknown. He should have written directly to the\nAcademy of Sciences\nin Paris, which would have had much more impact.\nThe third of da Silva's three Memoirs was on number theory. It was read by da Silva to the\nRoyal Academy of Sciences of Lisbon\nat the session on\n24\nMarch\n1852\nbut illness meant that the published version was incomplete\n(\nsee the quote about the publisher's note above\n)\n.\nTeixeira\nwrites\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nIn this area the author knew the works of\nEuler\n,\nLagrange\n,\nLegendre\n,\nGauss\nand\nPoinsot\n. The main subject he considered was the resolution of binomial congruences, a theory which belongs simultaneously to the domain of higher arithmetic and higher algebra, and he enriched it with such important and general results that his name deserves to be included in the list of those who founded it. It was indeed Daniel da Silva who first gave a method to solve systems of linear congruences, an honour which has been unduly attributed to the distinguished English arithmetician\nHenry Smith\n, who only in\n1861\ndealt with this subject, and was also the one who first undertook the general study of congruences.\nFor further comments by\nTeixeira\non these three Memoirs, see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nDa Silva's health prevented him from doing any serious mathematical research in the years following\n1852\n. However, only many later, after he had retired, his health did improve a little and he again undertook research. He published\nThe present and future of Mount Pius General\nin\n1868\nwhich is an actuarial work on annuity theory based on mortality tables. A few years later he published\nOn several new formulas of Analytical Geometry relative to the axes of oblique coordinates\nin\n1872\nwhich generalised certain formulas which are well-known for orthogonal axes to general non-orthogonal axes. He also published notes on physics.\nFor a list of all of da Silva's publications, see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nDa Silva's contribution were recognised with his election to the GrÃ©mio LiterÃ¡rio\n(1846)\n, the\nAcademy of Sciences of Lisbon\n(1850)\n, and the Institute of Coimbra\n(1855)\n. He played a major role in the GrÃ©mio LiterÃ¡rio, of which he was a founding member. In\n1849\nhe gave the course 'Popular Astronomy' which was run by that Society. He was elected to the Mathematical, Physical and Natural Sciences Class of the\nAcademy of Sciences of Lisbon\non\n27\nJanuary\n1852\n. His ill health prevented him playing as large a role in the Academy as he wished but, nevertheless, the Academy proposed that he be elected a \"Member of Merit\" in\n1858\nand, at the session which took place on\n20\nJanuary\n1859\n, the honour was conferred.\nDa Silva died in Oeiras following a severe bout of pneumonia. Oeiras is a coastal town to the west of Lisbon. He was buried in the CemitÃ©rio dos Prazeres in the western part of Lisbon.\nLet us end this biography by quoting from\nTeixeira\n[\n10\n]\n:-\nSome mathematicians make every effort to explore new regions of the world of numbers or to study those that others have previously initiated. This is Daniel da Silva. ... Daniel da Silva, poet of Mathematics, went to seek in these sciences what they possess that is beautiful ..."
