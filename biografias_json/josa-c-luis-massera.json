  "biografia": "JosÃ© Luis Massera\nwas the son of JosÃ© Pedro Massera MartÃ­nez\n(1866\n-\n1942)\nand Ema Lerena JoanicÃ³ who were both citizens of Uruguay, living in Genoa, Italy at the time their son was born. JosÃ© Pedro was a professor of philosophy who taught at the University of the Republic in Montevideo from\n1887\nto\n1927\n. He became a senator of the Republic of Uruguay for the Colorado Party\n(1927\n-\n1933)\nand is remembered today for having the Plaza JosÃ© Pedro Massera named for him in Montevideo. Ema Lerena was from a highly educated and wealthy family. JosÃ© Luis spent the first months of his life in Genoa, then returned to Montevideo with his parents. There they lived in a house in the La Blanqueada neighbourhood on Avenida\n8\nde Octubre near the junction with Calle Jaime Cibils. JosÃ© Luis had a sister Maria Ema Mercedes Massera Lerena\n(\nborn in Montevideo on\n22\nJuly\n1918\n, died Mexico City on\n4\nOctober\n1998)\nand a sister Maria Julia Josefina Massera Lerena\n(\nborn in Montevideo on\n21\nMarch\n1920\n, died in Montevideo on\n17\nApril\n2007)\n.\nIn\n1920\nJosÃ© Luis began his primary school education at the Crandon Institute situated, like his home, on the Avenida\n8\nde Octubre. After primary education, he attended the Lyceum before going to the Liceo NÂ°\n1\nJosÃ© Enrique RodÃ³ in the Old City of Montevideo. There he had a German mathematics teacher whom he found good and he started to become fascinated by the topic. After a lesson on equations, JosÃ© Luis went home and looked up 'equation' in his father's Encyclopaedic Dictionary and discovered there was a lot more to equations than he was learning at school. He began to look up other mathematics terms in the Encyclopaedic Dictionary. He explained in\n[\n17\n]\n:-\nThus, day by day and word by word, I began a tour, extremely chaotic, without a doubt, which was giving me a harvest of mathematical terms and valuable information about them, which I was slowly accumulating and conceptualising.\nFor more information about Massera's schooling, see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nAround\n1930\nhe went with his parents to Carlsbad in Czechoslovakia, and the family visited Paris on their return journey. There Massera bought a geometry textbook and a trigonometry textbook which he read enthusiastically and found very useful. Completing his studies at the Liceo, he entered the Alfredo VÃ¡zquez Acevedo Institute to prepare for university studies in engineering. A native Spanish speaker, he also could read English and French by this time but at this stage took private lessons in German so that he could read German mathematics texts.\nMassera was near the end of his course at the Alfredo VÃ¡zquez Acevedo Institute when one day he visited\nRafael Laguardia\n, who lived only three blocks from his house. They began a close friendship which lasted for the rest of\nLaguardia\n's life. Together with some other young mathematics enthusiasts, they set up a study group taking turns to read a mathematics text, then give a course on it to the group. Massera describes the study group in\n[\n20\n]\n:-\nInÂ\n1935\nÂ ... one day I visited\nLaguardia\n, without any sort of recommendation, in his very modest home, which was some three blocks from my own. I did not know\nLaguardia\n, but I knew who he was because a schoolmate had pointed him out to me in the quadrangle of the old Institute VÃ¡zquez AcevedoÂ\n(\nMontevideo's leading college preparatory school\n)\n. This visit started a very close friendship that lasted until his much lamented death a few years ago. ...\nLaguardia\nintroduced me to the small group of mathematical 'aficionados': Antonio Petracca, Fernando Fortezza, Carlos A Infantozzi, Luis Castagnetto, andÂ\nMischa Cotlar\n. ... I want to say a few more words to describe the ambience in the small mathematical circle at Montevideo at the time of our encounter. For a rather long while, every weekend \"Don\"Â\nJulio Rey Pastor\nÂ came to visit us from Buenos Aires and taught us about some of the new developments in mathematics - of which we knew nothing. Our mathematical relation withÂ\nRey Pastor\nÂ was very fruitful, since we were able to discuss our mathematical problems freely on a one-to-one basis. In this way, our horizons were open to the then new mathematics: general topology, algebra, modern analysis. Don Julio had a very complex personality, and occasionally he was very difficult to deal with; but the overall balance of our relationship with him was, undoubtedly, enormously positive for the development of mathematics in Uruguay. On the other hand, our small group established a close and relatively assiduous contact with the much larger and more mature group of the Argentine mathematicians. We participated in the main scientific meetings of the\nUniÃ³n MatemÃ¡tica Argentina\n, and published most of our first papers in its journal, the 'Revista de la UniÃ³n MatemÃ¡tica Argentina'.\nIn OctoberÂ\n1939\nÂ\nBeppo Levi\nleft Italy and emigrated to Argentina. Around the same time\nLuÃ­s SantalÃ³\nÂ emigrated to Argentina. They both made frequent trips to Montevideo to work with the study group and\nBeppo Levi\nin particular, encouraged Massera to undertake research in mathematics.\nBeppo Levi\nand Massera wrote the joint paper\nEstudio en grande de una ecuaciÃ³n diferencial del Segundo orden\nâ\n(\nLarge study of a second order differential equation\n)\nwhich was published in\n1947\n.\nFor a list of Massera's publications, see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nLet us go back to\n1935\n, for that was the year that Massera entered the Faculty of Engineering where he was taught analysis by Eduardo GarcÃ­a de ZÃºÃ±iga\n(1867\n-\n1951)\n, one of the first three engineers to graduate in Uruguay. ZÃºÃ±iga quickly realised that Massera was at a level far about the other students studying mathematics and in\n1937\nhe was appointed Assistant for Practical Classes of Mathematical Analysis. Although Massera's interests were firmly in studying mathematics, he was a student at the Faculty of Engineering training to be an Industrial Engineer. He felt that he had no option other than to complete the course, which he did in\n1943\n. He did, however, begin publishing during this engineering studies, for example:\nSobre la refracciÃ³n de las lÃ­neas de fuerza\nâ\n(\nOn the refraction of lines of force\n)\n(1937)\n, and\nIntegraciÃ³n de funciones racionales\nâ\n(\nIntegration of rational functions\n)\n(1937)\n.\nWhile an undergraduate, Massera married Carmen Garayalde Zubizarreta\n(1913\n-\n2002)\n, a teacher, artist and political activist and they had a son, JosÃ© Pedro, and a daughter Ema Massera Garayalde\n(\nborn\n1941)\nwho became a well-known writer. Massera later divorced Carmen Garayalde and married Martha Valentini who already had a daughter Moriana Hernandez from a previous marriage.\nDuring his undergraduate days, Massera became increasingly involved in politics. The world situation, with the Spanish Civil War and the rise of the Nazis in Germany, disturbed Massera greatly. In\n1939\n, the defeat of the Republicans in Spain and the invasion of Poland by the Nazis, motivated him to join a local Peace Movement of which he became President, and then the large movement, the Anti-Nazi Action for Aid to Free Peoples, where he became General Secretary. He joined the International World Peace Congress, and in\n1942\njoined the Communist Party of Uruguay. Also in\n1942\nthe Institute of Mathematics and Statistics was created and Massera joined immediately. He said\n[\n17\n]\n:-\nAt last the group of mathematical enthusiasts had a home, albeit a very modest one in its material reality: a spacious hall partitioned into smaller compartments. You could work, study, give courses, it was a qualitative change.\nIn\n1943\nMassera graduated as a Civil Engineer and was appointed as a Professor of Mathematical Analysis in the Faculty of Engineering. In the same year\nMarshall Stone\nvisited South America and met with Massera. He was very impressed and wrote to Harry Miller, who dealt with awarding Rockefeller fellowships, saying that Massera was under forty, showed a promising combination of interests, training and judgment that would help him \"make a real contribution to mathematical and scientific development\" in Uruguay. After Miller received a very positive recommendation from the Faculty of Engineering in Montevideo, he discussed the award of a Rockefeller fellowship with his colleagues and, in\n1944\n, Rockefeller approved funding Massera for one year at Stanford to study for a master's Degree. Massera began to make travel arrangements but, having made known his political beliefs, he was denied a visa in March\n1945\n. Miller continued trying to convince the U.S. immigration authorities to allow Massera to enter the United States.\nMassera was appointed as Professor of Higher Mathematics at the Faculty of Humanities and Sciences in Montevideo in\n1946\n. In October\n1946\nthe Rockefeller officials learnt that Massera was running for the Uruguayan Congress and they discussed awarding him a fellowship to study in Russia. In January\n1947\n, however, Massera was granted a U.S. visa and in March of that year travelled to Stanford where it had been arranged that\nGÃ¡bor SzegÃ¶\nwould supervise his studies.\nGeorge PÃ³lya\nwas also at Stanford and both he and\nSzegÃ¶\nmade Massera very welcome. The most interesting course Massera attended at Stanford was on real number theory given by\nHans Rademacher\n, a visiting professor.\nIn Palo Alto he lived in a private house and had the wife of an owner of General Motors as his landlady. She was visited by an FBI agent who quizzed her about Massera being a Communist. She told the agent her lodger behaved very well and studied very hard.\nMassera became interested in ship stabilisation problems and asked Rockefeller if he could transfer to New York and attend New York University and also travel by train between New York and Princeton to work with mathematicians at Princeton University. This was agreed and he lodged in a room in New York. At New York University he attended\nRichard Courant\n's Centre where, as well as\nCourant\n, there were other leading mathematicians such as\nKurt Friedrichs\nand\nEmil Artin\n. Massera said\n[\n17\n]\n:-\nI worked a lot with\nCourant\nand\nFriedrichs\non various topics and we became friends.\nHis most useful contact, however, was at Princeton where the Mathematics Department was headed by\nSolomon Lefschetz\nand others in the Department included\nWitold Hurewicz\n,\nRalph Hartzler Fox\nand\nEberhard Hopf\n. Working with\nLefschetz\nwas the most profitable experience for Massera. He said\n[\n17\n]\n:-\nA deep friendship and mutual collaboration developed between us that lasted until his death. At last, he was the mathematician I needed.\nMassera's research was going so well that he asked Rockefeller if they would extend his fellowship for another six months. They agreed and this period saw Massera produce his most important results. In\n1949\nhe published two important papers in the\nAnnals of Mathematics\n, one being\nOn Liapounoff's conditions of stability\nand the other\nThe number of subharmonic solutions of non-linear differential equations of the second order\n. In this second paper, Massera points out an error in\nNorman Levinson\n's paper\nTransformation theory of non-linear differential equations of the second order\n(1944)\n. In his paper, Massera corrected\nLevinson\n's error and provided necessary and sufficient conditions.\nReturning to Montevideo, Massera was appointed as Head of the Mathematics Laboratory of the Institute of Mathematics and Statistics. His time in the United States had been carefully monitored by the FBI. Barnay writes\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nWhile\n[\nMassera\n]\nwas in the United States, government agents followed his movements, intercepted his mail, covertly copied his diary, cultivated informants in his Stanford department and Palo Alto residence, investigated the Russian-born\nLefschetz\n, and interviewed\nSzegÃ¶\n, Miller, and others, though his FBI file reflects uncertainty over some of his whereabouts and activities.\nHe had taken the opportunity, not only to work hard at his mathematics, but also to see much of North America\n[\n18\n]\n:-\nI visited places and museums in New York, Quebec, Montreal, Ottawa and Toronto\n(\nthe great museum of Chinese antiquities\n)\n, the frozen Niagara Falls, the Colorado Canyon, beautiful San Francisco and many other places.\nThe International Congress of Mathematicians was due to take place in Cambridge, Massachusetts in September\n1950\n. Massera was keen to participate in this and also in the meeting of the\nInternational Mathematical Union\nat Columbia which was scheduled to take place before the Congress. There were two problems, however, one was to obtain funds and the other to obtain a visa. Neither problem was solved and in August\n1950\n, Massera informed both meetings that he would be unable to attend.\nPaul Halmos\nvisited Montevideo in\n1950\n-\n51\nand he writes about Massera in\n[\n10\n]\n:-\nMassera was a stocky chap, below average height, with dark but greying crew-cut hair, and a quiet, almost placid behaviour. He was warm and friendly to me. While he made no secret of being an active member of the local communist party, he managed to keep his political life carefully separated from his professional one. I saw him every day during the official hours of the institute\n(\nwhich during the winter were from\n1\n:\n30\nto\n6\n:\n30\nin the afternoon\n)\n. He stayed in his office more than most others\n(\nall offices could be spied on from all others thanks to an ingenious system of windows designed for that purpose\n)\n, and he appeared to be busy doing what mathematicians do. We discussed the weather over cups of tea, he told me the contents of his last year's course on\nHilbert\nspace, and he tried to interest me in his current differential equations research problem. He frequently became interested in the questions the rest of us were asking one another, and, after disappearing into his office to think about them, would pop out an hour or so later with the answers. He typed his own papers - long ones; he read the current journals; he conducted a seminar; and he guided several students in their seminar-related studies.\nHis ideology had at least an indirect effect on the daily life of the institute nevertheless. Because of his ideology he asked for a month's leave of absence to attend a political congress in the USSR. The request came at an inconvenient time, in the middle of a term;\nLaguardia\nhad to find someone to take Massera's classes, and he had to get along without Massera's help with the routine administrative chores. The worst part was that such a leave of absence heavily and publicly underscored the existence of a dyed-in-the-wool communist in the lnstituto. While communists were not as much feared and hated in Uruguay as in the States, they weren't exactly popular, especially not with the higher echelon of political officials\n(\nsuch as the ones in the Ministry of Education, whence all blessings flow\n)\n. And, of course, communists were not popular in the U.S. Embassy, and the Rockefeller Foundation, and other North American sources of the staff of life.\nLaguardia\nwas not happy.\nOne of the first students that Massera taught after returning to Montevideo from the United States was\nJuan Jorge SchÃ¤ffer\n. While he was still an undergraduate\nSchÃ¤ffer\npublished two joint papers with Massera,\nFigura mÃ­nima que cubre puntos de una red\nâ\n(\nMinimal figure covering points of a network\n)\n(1951)\nand\nSobre las curvas de nivel de una superficie convexa\nâ\n(\nOn the level curves of a convex surface\n)\n(1953)\n. After\nSchÃ¤ffer\njoined the faculty in Montevideo in\n1957\nthey published many joint papers, for example their first of a series\nLinear differential equations and functional analysis\nwas published in\n1958\nwith the sixth in the series appearing in\n1961\n-\n62\n. Their book\nLinear differential equations and function spaces\nwas published in\n1966\n. Constantin Corduneanu writes in the review\n[\n6\n]\n:-\nThe book contains in a more systematic and detailed form the main results in the theory of linear differential equations which the authors have obtained in the last years. The theory is developed for equations in a\nBanach\nspace and considerable emphasis is placed on the methods of functional analysis and on the use of function spaces. The book is addressed primarily to readers interested in the theory of differential equations, but no specialised knowledge in this field is required. ... The book is well-written, self-contained and constitutes undoubtedly an important tool in this field of investigation. The reviewer believes that the topics and methods of this book will find interesting developments in other branches of modern research such as control theory and functional equations.\nDuring the\n1960\ns and\n1970\ns, Massera published many high quality mathematics papers and many political papers. Among the many political papers we give English translations of a few titles:\nThe triumph of Leninism\n(1957)\n,\nThe Communists and peace, democracy, patriotism\n(1958)\n,\nLeninism, inexhaustible source of inspiration and teaching\n(1960)\n,\nA contribution to the unity of the international Communist movement\n(1964)\n, and\nMachiavelli and Marxism\n(1969)\n. He had become a member of the Executive Committee of the Communist Party of Uruguay in\n1955\nand in\n1963\nhe was elected National Deputy for the Left Liberation Front. Also in\n1963\nhe resigned as Associate Professor of Mathematical Analysis, but continued to work on an honorary basis, teaching courses and working for the Institute of Mathematics and Statistics.\nAlthough most of the political references will not be understood by those unfamiliar with the politics of Uruguay, we quote from a report by\nEl Popular\non\n8\nMay\n1968\nof a radio broadcast by the Left Liberation Front\n[\n25\n]\n:-\nSpeaking first, Deputy Massera said \"The millionaires have had enough time.  Now it is the turn of the people!\" Massera noted that during the last\n10\ndays national life had been full of grave political developments, including: savage repression of the\n1\nMay demonstration; formation of a new cabinet; devaluation of the peso; continuation of the struggle in the National Port Administration between the workers and Ribas; the Acosta y Lara scandal, and the scandal in connection with the peso devaluation that permitted those who knew to make millions. Massera said that the new cabinet, in which Charlone and Legnani remain, now includes such persons as Peirano Facio, representative of a large bank; and Frick Davies, a big landowner from Durazno who is the voice of the Latifundists. He said, \"These people represent many millions of pesos but few votes. They show the raw face of government by the oligarchy, a government remote from authentic representation of the people.\"\nThere was a right-wing military coup in Uruguay in June\n1973\n. On\n22\nOctober\n1975\nMassera was arrested. The details are contained in a submission to the Committee on Foreign Relations, International Human Rights Treaties Hearings Before the Committee on Foreign Relations, United States Senate heard in\n1980\n[\n25\n]\n:-\nThe author claims that her stepfather JosÃ© Luis Massera, professor of mathematics and former Deputy to the National Assembly, was arrested on\n22\nOctober\n1975\nand held incommunicado until his detention was made known in January\n1976\n. She claims that he was denied the right of 'habeas corpus' before the civil and military courts and that an application to the Commission on Respect for Human Rights of the Council of State went unanswered. On\n15\nAugust\n1976\nhe was tried by a military court on the charge of \"subversive association\" for being one of the leaders of a banned political party. The author further states that her stepfather suffered permanent damage as a result of torture. In her letter of\n4\nAugust\n1977\nshe states that, having been forced to remain standing with his head hooded for long hours, he lost his balance, fell down and broke his leg which was not immediately taken care of, resulting in that leg being now several centimetres shorter than the other one. The author further submits that her stepfather remains imprisoned and that in his double quality as former Deputy and as an accused tried for a political offence, he has been deprived of all his political rights by a Government decree.\nThe author claims that her mother, Martha Valentini de Massera, was arrested on\n28\nJanuary\n1976\nwithout any formal charges and that in September\n1976\nshe was accused of \"assistance to subversive association\", an offence which carries a penalty of two to eight years imprisonment. She was not allowed to receive visits until November\n1976\n, but had again been taken to an unknown place at the time of the submission of the communication in February\n1977\n. In a subsequent letter of\n6\nJune\n1979\nthe author states that her mother was tried by a military court and sentenced to three and a half years imprisonment due to expire on\n28\nJuly\n1979\n. Having been subjected to ill-treatment during her detention, her mother had furthermore suffered from the inadequate diet and the prevailing state of unhealthy working conditions, so that her health had been weakened.\nMassera was released on\n3\nMarch\n1984\nafter appeals by the\nAmerican Mathematical Society\n, the Cuban Society of Mathematicians, the European Parliament,\n50\nNobel Prize winners, members of the Austrian Parliament, members of the Australian Parliament and a large number of mathematicians and scientists from Mexico, United States, Spain, France, Great Britain, West Germany and Japan. Michel BrouÃ© and GÃ©rard Gonzalez-Sprinberg write\n[\n4\n]\n:-\nA vast movement of international solidarity formed for his release.\nLaurent Schwartz\nand\nJean DieudonnÃ©\ntravelled to Montevideo for this purpose, on behalf of the Committee of Mathematicians.\nFor Massera's own description of his prison experiences, see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nMany universities had shown their support by awarding Massera honorary degrees while he was in prison, including: \"La Sapienzia\", Rome, Italy\n(1978)\n; Humboldt University, Berlin, Germany\n(1980)\n; University of Nice Sophia Antipolis, Nice, France\n(1981)\n; BenemÃ©rita Universidad AutÃ³noma de Puebla, Puebla, Mexico\n(1982)\n; Universidad San Francisco de Quito, Quito, Ecuador\n(1982)\n; International University of La Paz, La Paz, Bolivia\n(1983)\n; the University of Havana, Havana, Cuba\n(1983)\n, Autonomous University of Mexico, Toluca, Mexico\n(1983)\n, University of Budapest, Budapest, Hungary\n(1984)\n, and the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\n(1984)\n.\nAfter his release from prison, Massera traveled to Europe in\n1985\nand personally received his Honorary degrees from the Universities of Budapest, Nice, Berlin and Rome. He was appointed again to his position as Professor of Mathematics at the Institute of Mathematics and Statistics in Montevideo. In\n1991\nhe received the title of Doctor Honoris Causa from the University of the Republic in Montevideo and the following year he was elected to\nThe World Academy of Sciences\nbased in Trieste, Italy. In the second half of the\n1990\ns, he organised Marxist seminars at the Sorbonne and other academic centres. In\n1998\nhe gave the lectures\n(\n[\n17\n]\n,\n[\n18\n]\n,\n[\n19\n]\n)\nfrom which we have quoted.\nIn\n2010\n, R Markarian and E Mordecki\n(\neds.\n)\npublished\nJosÃ© Luis Massera: Ciencia y compromiso social\nâ\n(\nJosÃ© Luis Massera: Science and social commitment\n)\n[\n14\n]\n.
