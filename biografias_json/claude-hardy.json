  "biografia": "Claude Hardy\n's father was SÃ©bastien Hardy, seigneur of Estour and of Tabaize. SÃ©bastien had been born in Paris in\n1564\nbut had studied in Le Mans where he became a tax collector. He married Marie Belot Despontis in Paris around\n1596\nand their son Claude, one of their seven children, was born in Le Mans. The date of his birth is uncertain, some experts giving\n1598\nand others giving\n1604\n. SÃ©bastien Hardy was an educated man who used his skill in languages to made translations from Spanish and Italian. The Hardy family moved to Paris soon after Claude was born where SÃ©bastien was named as a Conseiller at the court. In\n1604\nthe family were living in rue Quinquempoix, in the parish of St Jacques de la Boucherie but by\n1610\nthey had moved to a home in rue St HonorÃ©, in the parish of St Germain de l'Auxerrois.\nWe know nothing of Claude's upbringing other than the locations of the homes in which he lived. However, in\n1613\nhe published a translation of a work by Erasmus under the title\nDe la civilitÃ© morale des enfants\nâ\n(\nOf the moral civility of children\n)\n. This work, dedicated to the twelve year old King Louis XIII, was:-\n... composed in Latin by Erasmus; translated into French by Claude Hardy, Parisian, aged nine years.\nThis, of course, suggests that Claude Hardy was indeed born in\n1604\n(\nbeing nine years old in\n1613)\n, but this seems somewhat at odds with when his father was known to be in Le Mans. It is possible, of course, that Hardy did translate the work when nine years old but it was only published some six years later. Although it might seem impossible for so young a child to translate from Latin to French, we do know that Hardy had the reputation for being a remarkable linguist with knowledge of thirty-six languages. His friends claimed that some of these languages took him no more than one day of study to master them. Even if these claims are somewhat exaggerated, nevertheless it is clear that Hardy, taking after his father, had a remarkable ability to learn languages. In\n1614\nhe published another translation, this time the work of the poet Michel Verin who died in Florence in\n1487\nat the age of\n19\n. The poetry was translated from Latin to French by Hardy and published as a prose work\nLes Distique Moraux de Michel Verin\nâ\n(\nThe moral disorders of Michel Verin\n)\n. This time the book claimed to be:-\n... translated into French by Claude Hardy, Parisian, aged eleven years.\nPerhaps given the young age of the translator, it is not too surprising that the translation has been described as \"lively, sometimes obscure, and full of dubious and antiquated expressions.\" In the Preface, Hardy pays a fine tribute to his father.\nNothing of Hardy's education in Paris is known and the first information about him after\n1614\nis not until\n1622\nwhen records show that Claude Hardy married Perrette Presche in Paris. These records give his date of birth as\n1604\n, making him eighteen years old when he married. Nothing is known about Perrette Presche. In\n1625\nwe know for certain that Claude Hardy was a practising lawyer in Paris. Hardy, in his capacity as a lawyer, worked for the Parliament in Paris from\n1625\n. A year later he was certainly attached to the court of justice in Paris as a counsellor. In\n1625\nhe published another work, this time\nEuclidis Data, & Marini Philosophi in Data Euclidis commentarius graece & latine\nâ\n(\nThe data of Euclid, and the commentary of the philosopher Marinus on it in Greek and Latin\n)\n. He edited the Greek edition of\nEuclid\nand provided a Latin translation of the work and the commentary by\nMarin Mersenne\n. He became involved with a group of mathematicians working in Paris at this time, in particular becoming a friend of\nClaude Mydorge\n. He was in\nMydorge\n's home when he was introduced to\nRenÃ© Descartes\nwho was a friend of\nMydorge\n. This was the beginning of a close friendship between Hardy and\nDescartes\nduring which they exchanged views on all the scientific and philosophical issues of the day. Hardy's great skill in languages made him extremely useful to\nDescartes\nand to other scholars who often turned to him for help with translations, particularly from Arabic. In a letter which\nDescartes\nwrote to\nMersenne\non\n20\nNovember\n1629\nhe says:-\nAnd I assure you, that if you give Mr Hardy a good dictionary in Chinese, or any other language whatsoever, and a book written in the same language, he will undertake to make sense of it.\nA translation into French of\nViÃ¨te\n's book on algebra, originally written in Latin, appeared around\n1630\nwith Antoine Vasset as the translator. It is believed that \"Antoine Vasset\" was a pseudonym for Claude Hardy. In\n1630\n, under his own name, Hardy published\nExamen\nâ\n(\nExamination\n)\nand in\n1638\nhe published\nRefutation\n. These works dealt with the problem of the\nduplication of the cube\nand in them Hardy pointed out a fallacy which had arisen regarding this problem\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nSeveral writers of the seventeenth century suggested methods for the duplication of the cube, including\nViÃ¨te\n,\nDescartes\n,\nFermat\n, and\nNewton\n. Among the less well-known persons who also occupied themselves with this problem was Paul Yvon, lord of Laleu, who claimed that he had found the construction of the two mean proportionals, required in solving the problem. In addition to\nMydorge\nand\nJ de Beaugrand\n, Hardy exposed the fallacy of Yvon's construction ....\nHardy took part in the meetings\nMersenne\norganised with\nRoberval\n,\nGassendi\n,\nDescartes\nand others such as\nÃtienne Pascal\nand later his young son\nBlaise Pascal\n. In\n1637\nMersenne\ngave\nDescartes\na copy of\nFermat\n's\nDe Maximis et Minimis et de Tangentibus\nâ\n(\nOn maxima, minima and tangents\n)\nto review.\nDescartes\nwrote a strong criticism of\nFermat\n's work which he gave to\nMersenne\nwith instructions to forward his review to\nFermat\n.\nMersenne\nalso let\nRoberval\nand\nÃtienne Pascal\n, both friends of\nFermat\n, see\nDescartes\n' critical attack.\nDescartes\nwrote to\nMersenne\nmaking sure that others, particularly his friend Hardy, be given details of the controversy. An argument followed in which Hardy took\nDescartes\n' side, as did\nMydorge\nand\nDesargues\n, while\nFermat\nwas supported by\nRoberval\nand\nÃtienne Pascal\n. Of course,\nFermat\n's methods as given in\nDe Maximis et Minimis et de Tangentibus\nâ\n(\nOn maxima, minima and tangents\n)\nare perfectly correct but he had not stated his innovative results rigorously enough to satisfy his opponents. One must also realise that\nDescartes\nbelieved that only with his methods could really innovative mathematical ideas be discovered so he was set against ideas from anyone who had not followed his way of thinking. The important point to make here is the high value which\nDescartes\nplaced on Hardy's opinions and support.\nFinally, we know Hardy undertook chemistry experiments with Annibal Barlet, a physician who taught alchemy in Paris, and with Pierre Borel, before he became physician to Louis XIV in\n1654\n. After the death of\nDescartes\nin\n1650\n, information about Hardy vanishes and we know nothing about the last\n25\nyears of his life."
