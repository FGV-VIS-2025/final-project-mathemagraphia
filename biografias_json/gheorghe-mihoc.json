  "biografia": "Gheorghe Mihoc\n's parents were Ecaterina and Gheorghe Mihoc. The parents were born in Banat, an ethnically mixed region which, in\n1920\n, was divided between Romania, Hungary and Yugoslavia. In order to improve their chances of making a living, they had moved from Banat to BrÄila, a city on the river Danube and the second largest port in Romania. They were in that city when their son Gheorghe, the subject of this biography, was born but they did not remain there for very much longer. Again hoping to improve their circumstances, the family moved when Gheorghe was two years old, settling in Bucharest. It was in this city that Gheorghe spent the rest of his childhood, indeed he spent most of the rest of his life in Bucharest.\nAfter attending elementary school in Bucharest, Mihoc's secondary education was at the Gheorghe Sincai\nGymnasium\n. It was here that he developed a love of mathematics and it is interesting to quote his own thoughts on this\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nI had some good teachers ... all of whom inspired my love for this science. But there was still another element that directed me at an early stage towards mathematics, namely the existence of the 'Mathematical Gazette'. ... In its pages the names of the young authors who solved and proposed mathematical problems were mentioned. the fact that students have the opportunity to publish problems which they have discovered is of great pedagogical importance. During lessons, as well as in their private work based on textbooks, they learn to solve problems, and this helps them to understand more deeply what they are taught.\nMihoc graduated from the Gheorghe Sincai Gymnasium in\n1925\nand, in the same year, entered the Faculty of Science of the University of Bucharest. However he could not concentrate fully on his university courses since he had to earn money to finance his studies. He would spend three undergraduate years working incredibly hard studying and earning money. At Bucharest University, he was taught geometry by\nGheorghe ÈiÈeica\n, the professor of Analytical Geometry.\nÈiÈeica\nhad just published the monograph\nGÃ©omÃ©trie diffÃ©rentielle projective des rÃ©seaux\nâ\n(\nProjective differential geometry of networks\n)\n(1923)\nand, when he taught Mihoc, was writing another important monograph\nThe projective differential geometry of lattices.\nÈiÈeica\n's geometry lectures gave the spirit of current research and inspired Mihoc. Sadly his other lecturers were much less good and, in particular, analysis courses were taught by lecturers who were not active in the research of the day nor had they kept pace with current developments. In his third and final undergraduate year, Mihoc attended a course on probability theory given by\nOctav Onicescu\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nIt was an inspiring course outlining the state of the field at that time. This was my first contact with the discipline that was later to become my speciality.\nOctav Onicescu\nhad studied geometry under\nTullio Levi-Civita\nin Rome before spending some time on a visit to Paris. He returned to his native Bucharest in\n1922\nand, two years later, taught the first college-level\nprobability theory\ncourse in Romania.\nGraduating in\n1928\n, Mihoc was unable to find employment as a teacher. However, his career was saved by\nOnicescu\nwho was promoted to professor the year that Mihoc graduated.\nOnicescu\nnot only found Mihoc a job in the Department of Statistics and Actuarial Studies of the Social Insurance Service, but even persuaded the Service that they should fund him to spend a year in Rome undertaking specialist actuarial training. He spent\n1928\n-\n29\nin the Faculty of Statistical and Actuarial Sciences of the University of Rome. There were many outstanding mathematicians in the Faculty including\nFrancesco Cantelli\n, one of the most prominent Italian contributors to the mathematical theory of probability, and\nGuido Castelnuovo\nwho, although a specialist in algebraic geometry, had written the probability text\nCalcolo della probabilitÃ\nâ\n(\nCalculation of probability\n)\n(1919)\nand was teaching courses on probability.\nCastelnuovo\nwrote:-\nProbability is a science of recent formation; hence in it, better than in other branches of mathematics, one can see the relationship between the empirical contribution and the one given by reasoning, and between the process of inductive and deductive logic used in it. The fact that it is a science in the making explains why it is appropriate to give frequent examples to show the applications of known methods or to introduce new ones.\nAlso teaching in the Faculty were the statisticians Corrado Gini\n(1884\n-\n1965)\n, who set up the School of Statistics in Rome in\n1928\n, and Franco Savorgnan\n(1879\n-\n1963)\n, who went on to succeeded Gini as the head of Istituto Centrale di Statistica and Consiglio Superiore di Statistica in\n1932\n. Mihoc was also taught by the economist Rodolfo Benini who had held the chair of statistics in Rome until\n1928\nwhen he was appointed to the chair of economics. Mihoc studied for the degree of Doctor of Statistical and Actuarial Sciences advised by\nCastelnuovo\nand defended his thesis on Markov chains in Rome in July\n1930\n. In this thesis he applied results obtained by\nSergei Bernstein\nin his\n1926\npaper\nSur l'extension du thÃ©orÃ¨me limite du calcul des probabilitÃ©s aux sommes de quantitÃ©s dÃ©pendantes\nâ\n(\nOn the extension of the limit theorem of probability to sums of dependent quantities\n)\nto extend results obtained by\nA A Markov\non Markov chains in his\n1912\nbook.\nAfter returning to Bucharest, Mihoc continued with his actuarial work and was appointed as an assistant at the School of Statistics, Actuarial Studies, and Calculation which had been founded in that year. At this School, which was later named an Institute, Mihoc taught actuarial mathematics from\n1930\nto\n1948\n. At the same time, he undertook research for a doctorate advised by\nOctav Onicescu\n. In\n1934\nhe submitted his thesis\nOn the general properties of dependent statistical variables\n(\nRomanian\n)\nto the University of Bucharest and was awarded a doctorate in mathematics on\n28\nApril of that year. His thesis was published in two parts in\n1935\nand\n1936\n. By this time Mihoc was collaborating with his former professor,\nOctav Onicescu\n, and they published\nSur les chaines de variables statistiques\nâ\n(\nOn chains of statistical variables\n)\nin\n1935\n. In this paper they gave sufficient conditions for ergodicity of a Markov chain. Their collaboration was very fruitful with four joint papers being published in\n1936\n, three in\n1937\n, one in\n1938\n, and three in each of\n1939\nand\n1940\n. In\n1937\nMihoc was appointed as an assistant at the University of Bucharest and was promoted first to lecturer, then to professor. He worked at the University of Bucharest until\n1973\n.\nWe give a few more details of his career at the University of Bucharest after first looking at other aspects of Mihoc's contributions. One of these is the remarkable collection of books he authored or co-authored. After looking at these we give some details of the many positions he held, both academic and non-academic, which were highly influential in the development of statistics in Romania. To see a selection of the many books that he wrote, some followed by reviewers comments, the reader should consult\nTHIS LINK\n.\nLet us mention here that the list, which is not complete, contains\n26\nitems spanning\n44\nyears. The last book in the list was published in\n1981\n, the year in which Mihoc died at the age of\n75\n. Most are Romanian texts that were never translated into English. A few were written in French. Five are co-authored with\nOctav Onicescu\nincluding:\nLa dÃ©pendance statistique. ChaÃ®nes et familles de chaÃ®nes discontinues\nâ\n(\nStatistical dependence. Chains and  families of discontinuous chains\n)\n(1937)\nand\nLectures on mathematical statistics\n(\nRomanian\n)\n(1957)\n. Only two of the\n26\nare singled authored:\nTreatise on actuarial mathematics\n(\nRomanian\n)\n(1943)\nand\nAn Introduction to the calculus of probability\n(\nRomanian\n)\n(1954)\n. We should also single out for special mention the four volume\nTreatise on mathematical statistics\n(\nRomanian\n)\nhe wrote with Virgil Craiu. The four volumes are subtitled:\nSampling and estimation\n(1976)\n;\nTesting statistical hypotheses\n(1977)\n;\nSequential analysis\n(1979)\n; and\nCorrelation and linear regression\n(1981)\n. We note that, several years before this collaboration, Mihoc supervised Craiu's doctoral studies; he was awarded his doctorate in\n1968\n.\nDespite this outstanding publication record consisting of the impressive list of books already mentioned together with\n70\nresearch papers, Mihoc also spent much of his career in administration. However, he writes in\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nAfter a life devoted to science, I still feel I should have done more. This would have been possible if I could have spent less time in administrative and organisational work. On the other hand, I think that my involvement in such activities put me in a position where I was able to facilitate the access of deserving young people to research and teaching. Thus, at least in part, I do not regard these administrative duties as pure waste.\nWe have already given a few details of Mihoc's career, but we now give a few more. Between\n1942\nand\n1946\nhe was a lecturer at the University of Bucharest, and then between\n1946\n-\n1948\nprofessor for financial mathematics at the Academy of Commerce. After educational reforms in\n1948\n, he was appointed professor in the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics of the University of Bucharest, where he went on to become head of Applied Mathematics. He continued to hold this chair until his retirement. Meanwhile he was Director General of the Central Directorate of Statistics\n(1948\n-\n1951)\n, dean of the Faculty of Mathematics\n(1951\n-\n1960)\nand vice-rector of Bucharest University between\n1960\nand\n1963\n, after which he became rector for a period of five years until\n1968\n. He was elected a corresponding member of\nRomanian Academy of Sciences\nin\n1955\n. Elected a full member on\n20\nMarch\n1963\n, he became President of the Academy in March\n1980\n, holding this position until his death. On\n1\nApril\n1964\nMihoc founded, as a research institute of the\nRomanian Academy\n, the Centre for Mathematical Statistics where most of the Romanian specialists in probability theory, theoretical statistics and applied statistical sciences meet:-\nMihoc's motivation was a visionary understanding of the part that probability and statistics would play in the not very distant future, rather than the considerable expansion of these fields at the time.\nHe was director of the Centre until\n1976\nand, in\n1997\nwas given the honour that the Centre was named for him.\nIn addition he organised many conferences in Romania. We mention in particular the series of conferences on probability in\n1955\n,\n1962\n,\n1968\n,\n1971\n,\n1974\nand\n1979\n. He also organised the Anglo-Romanian Conference on Mathematics and Archaeological and Historical Sciences in\n1970\nand, four years later, the Eighth International Conference on Biometry. He died suddenly on Christmas day in\n1981\nhaving suffered a coronary thrombosis."
