  "biografia": "Kosaku Yosida\nwas born in Hiroshima, a large industrial city on Honshu Island around\n800\nkm south east of Tokyo. He was brought up in Tokyo where he attended school, then entered the Faculty of Science of Tokyo Imperial University. This university, established in\n1877\n, had been devastated by the Great Kanto earthquake which struck on Saturday,\n1\nSeptember\n1923\n. Yosida graduated with his first degree in\n1931\n, having taken mathematics as his main subject. He had been taught by Takuji Yosie\n(1874\n-\n1947)\nand was friendly with fellow student\nHidegoro Nakano\nwho also studied at Tokyo Imperial University and obtained the degree of bachelor of science in March\n1933\n.\nYosida continued to study at Tokyo Imperial University beginning research and publishing papers on meromorphic functions and ordinary differential equations such as:\nOn the asymptotic property of the differential equation\ny\n\"\n+\nH\n(\nx\n)\ny\n=\nf\n(\nx\n,\ny\n,\ny\nâ²\n)\ny\" + H(x)y = f(x, y, y')\ny\n\"\n+\nH\n(\nx\n)\ny\n=\nf\n(\nx\n,\ny\n,\ny\nâ²\n)\n(1932)\n;\nOn the distribution of a-points of solutions for linear differential equation of the second order\n(1932)\n;\nOn the characteristic function of a transcendental meromorphic solution of an algebraic differential equation of the first order and of the first degree\n(1933)\n;\nA remark to a theorem due to Halphen\n(1933)\n,\nA note on Riccati's equation\n(1933)\n;\nA generalisation of a Malmquist's theorem\n(1933)\n; and\nOn a class of meromorphic functions\n(1934)\n.\nIn\n1933\nYosida was appointed as an Assistant in the Department of Mathematics at Osaka Imperial University. Osaka is on Honshu Island, roughly half way between Hiroshima and Tokyo. The Osaka Imperial University is based on educational institutions dating back to the\n18\nth century but only became a university in\n1931\n, two years before Yosida was appointed there. After one year, he was promoted to Associate Professor.\nMoving to Osaka Imperial University led to Yosida changing the direction of his research. Two mathematicians who joined the Department of Mathematics shortly after him and were to strongly influence him were Mitio Nagumo\n(1905\n-\n1995)\nand\nShizuo Kakutani\n. Nagumo had graduated from Tokyo Imperial University in March\n1928\nand spent two years at the University of GÃ¶ttingen, Germany, before being appointed to Osaka Imperial University in March\n1934\n.\nKakutani\nhad studied at Tohoku University in Sendai before being appointed as a teaching assistant at Osaka Imperial University in\n1934\n. Yosida became interested in functional analysis through discussions with these two mathematicians. He published several joint papers with\nKakutani\n, for example:\nOn meromorphic functions\n(1935)\n;\nApplication of mean ergodic theorem to the problems of Markoff's process\n(1938)\n;\nMarkoff process with an enumerable infinite number of possible states\n(1939)\n; and\nBirkhoff's ergodic theorem and the maximal ergodic theorem\n(1939)\n. In this last mentioned paper the authors prove two theorems, the first being the Ergodic Theorem of\nG D Birkhoff\n(\nin its form given by\nAndrei Kolmogorov\nin a\n1937\npaper\n)\n, while the second theorem is new and the authors call it the Maximal Ergodic Theorem. This new theorem is stronger than one proved by\nNorbert Wiener\nin his\n1939\npaper\nThe Ergodic Theorem\n. The authors write:-\nIn the present note, we shall give a direct proof of Theorem\n2\n. Our method of proof is a modification of that of\nKhinchin\n-\nKolmogorov\nwhich was used to prove Theorem\n1\n; and it is to be noted that we can prove Theorem\n1\n(\nG D Birkhoff\n's Ergodic Theorem\n)\nand Theorem\n2\n(\nMaximal Ergodic Theorem\n)\nsimultaneously by the same principle without appealing to Maximal Theorem\n[\nof\nHardy\nand\nLittlewood\n]\nnor to the Mean Ergodic Theorem\n[\nof\nvon Neumann\n]\n.\nKiyosi Ito\nwrites in\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nThe most original work during his stay in Osaka\n(1933\n-\n42)\nis probably a series of papers on the operator-theoretical treatment of ergodicÂ theory, some written jointly with Kakutani.\nIn\n1939\nYosida was awarded a doctorate from the Osaka University and, in the following year, he spent the autumn quarter of\n1940\n-\n41\nat the University of Washington in the United States:-\nThe University of Washington announced that Professor KÃ´saku Yosida of the Mathematical Institute of Nagoya University has been appointed Walker-Ames Professor for the autumn quarter.\nIn\n1942\n, he moved to Nagoya when appointed as a Professor in the Department of Mathematics at Nagoya Imperial University. Nagoya lies between Osaka and Tokyo and became the site of Nagoya Imperial University in\n1939\n, the university being established on a medical school which had existed there since\n1871\n. Yosida's main task at Professor of Mathematics was to promote and expand the newly established Department of Mathematics and this he did very successfully, through much hard work, along with his colleagues.\nKiyosi Ito\nwrites in\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nThe work that made Yosida's name world-famous must be the theory of semigroups and its applications. This theory was published in\n1948\nwhen he was at Nagoya University. It is now called the\nHille\n-Yosida theory .... The influence of this theory was far-reaching: Yosida and many others applied it to numerous areas in analysis such as diffusion equations,\nMarkov\nprocesses, hyperbolic equations, and potential theory.\nYosida published\nTopological Analysis\nin Japanese in\n1951\n. This book was a major contribution to functional analysis, the subject being known as 'topological analysis' in Japan at this time. Hirotada Anzai writes in a review:-\nThis is a comprehensive book on functional analysis. In Chapters\n1\n-\n5\nfundamental concepts of functional analysis are introduced, and important concrete functional spaces are illustrated. Naturally these chapters are written in a modern way compared with\nBanach\n's book \"ThÃ©orie des opÃ©rations linÃ©aires''. Chapter\n6\ndeals with the theory of commutative normed rings of the Russian school, which will be a motivation for the following Chapters\n7\n-\n10\n.\nThis book was expanded and modernised by Yosida when he published his classic work\nFunctional Analysis\n(1965)\n. We say more about this English work below and the reader can read the Preface to each of the six editions as well as extracts from some reviews at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nIn\n1953\nYosida returned to Osaka University when he was appointed Professor in the Department of Mathematics there. In September\n1954\nhe flew to New York via London, England. His\n22\nSeptember flight from London to New York was on Pan American Airways. This trip to the United States was made to spend some time at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton. He spent the months from September\n1954\nto January\n1955\nat the Institute. Back in Japan, Yosida moved to Tokyo when he was appointed as Professor in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Tokyo. He was one of several leading mathematicians who tried to persuade the Japanese government to found a Japanese institute for mathematics. They succeeded but, since Tokyo already had many research institutes, it was decided that the Research Institute for Mathematical Sciences would be part of Kyoto University. Yosida remained a professor at the University of Tokyo until he retired in March\n1969\nwhen he reached the age of sixty. In April\n1969\n, he organised an international symposium on functional analysis at the Research Institute for Mathematical Sciences at Kyoto. After retiring from Tokyo University, Yosida became Director of the Research Institute for Mathematical Analysis, Kyoto University, holding this position from\n1972\nto\n1976\n. After this four year appointment, he became Professor at Gakushuin University, a private university in Tokyo, serving until he reached the age of\n70\nin\n1979\n.\nThe International Congress of Mathematicians was held in Edinburgh, Scotland, from\n14\nto\n21\nAugust\n1958\n. Yosida attended the Congress and gave a short presentation entitled\nOn the differentiability of a semi-group of operators\n. The International Congress of Mathematicians was held in Kyoto, Japan, from\n21\nto\n29\nAugust\n1990\n. Yosida was an Honorary Member of the Organising Committee of the Congress but sadly died in June\n1990\n, two months before the Congress took place.\nYosida published a number of important books. These include\nLectures on differential and integral equations\n(1960)\n,\nTheory of distributions\n(\nJapanese\n)\n(1960)\n,\nFunctional analysis\n(1965)\n, which ran to six editions, and\nOperational Calculus - A Theory of Hyperfunctions\n(1984)\n. For extracts from reviews of these books see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nHe also published Japanese books including\nLinear Operators\n(1943)\n,\nSpectral Analysis\n(1947)\n,\nErgodic Theorems\n(1948)\n,\nIntroduction to Physical Mathematics\n(1949)\n,\nIntegral equation theory\n(1950)\n,\nHilbert Space Theory\n(1953)\n,\nMethods for solving differential equations\n(1954)\n, and\nMeasure and Integration theory\n(1976)\n.\nIn addition to these books, Yosida wrote, in collaboration with colleagues, a number of mathematical textbooks in Japanese. These include\nApplied mathematics manual\n(1954)\n,\nBasics of Phase Analysis\n(1960)\n,\nApplied Mathematics, University Seminar No.\n1\n(1961)\n,\nFunction Analysis and Differential Equations\n(1976)\n, and I\nntroduction to Modern Analysis\n(1991)\n.\nAfter retiring from Gakushuin University, he continued to undertake research\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nAfter\n1980\nhe was mainly interested in modernizing operational calculus from\nMikusinski\n's viewpoint.\nIn fact he tried to popularise this approach by writing an elementary approach with the textbook\nOperational Calculus - A Theory of Hyperfunctions.\nH G Dales and\nD G Crighton\nwrite in\n[\n3\n]\n:-\nIt is, of course, a programme of some antiquity to seek to solve differential equations by reducing them to algebraic equations. One method for this is to use\nLaplace\ntransformations, and a well-known and powerful technique for implementing this method is\nMikusinski\n's operational calculus. The aim of the present work is \"to give a simplified exposition as well as an extension of\" this calculus.\nYosida played a major role in the\nMathematical Society of Japan\n. He served the Society as its president for a total of seven terms\n(1957\n,\n1959\n,\n1962\n,\n1964\n,\n1965\n,\n1967\n,\n1972)\n. He was a Member of the Science Council of Japan, and a Member of the Executive Committee of the\nInternational Mathematical Union\n. He was elected a member of the\nJapan Academy\non\n13\nDecember\n1971\n. In addition he was honoured with a number of awards. He received the Fujiwara Prize in\n1964\n:-\nIn\n1959\n, Ginjiro Fujiwara, a Japanese industrialist and politician,Â turned over much of his private fortune to a charitable foundation, the Fujiwara Foundation of Science. The Foundation awards the Fujiwara Prize to scientists who have made important contributions to the advancement of science and technology.\nThe\nJapan Academy\nawarded Yosida their Emperor's Prize in\n1967\n. He received the Honorary Medal from the University of LiÃ¨ge in\n1970\n; was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society of LiÃ¨ge in\n1976\n; became a member of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in\n1977\n; was elected to the\nAmerican Academy of Arts and Sciences\non\n11\nMay\n1977\n, and became an Officier of the Ordre des Palmes AcadÃ©miques in\n1978\n. This last mentioned award is given by the French Republic to distinguished academics and leading figure in the field of education.\nThe book\n[\n1\n]\ncontains many of Yosida's papers. The editor,\nKiyosi Ito\n, writes:-\nEveryone who reads this volume will be able to picture the image of an outstanding mathematician, KosakuÂ Yosida, who made a tremendous contribution to promote functional analysisÂ inÂ JapanÂ up to the international level.\nThe publisher Springer-Verlag writes about the book:-\nKosaku Yosida is world famous as the founder, together with\nEinar Hille\n, of the theory of semigroups. These collected papers provide valuable information on how he started and developed functional analysis and operator theoretical methods in the theory of differential equations and probability theory. The book is divided into\n10\nsections following the main topics on which Yosida worked. Each section includes comments by a specialist of the fields for the benefit of the reader. An extensive bibliography of all Yosida's papers, both English and Japanese, is included. This edition will prove invaluable to anyone wanting a comprehensive view of Yosida's work."
