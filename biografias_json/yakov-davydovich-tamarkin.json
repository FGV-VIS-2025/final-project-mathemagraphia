  "biografia": "Yakov Davydovich Tamarkin\n(\nknown after he emigrated to the United States as\nJ D Tamarkin\nor\nJacob David Tamarkin\n)\nwas born into a wealthy family. His father, David Tamarkin, was a doctor, and his mother was Sophie Krassilschikov. The family moved to St Petersburg where Tamarkin attended the Second\nGymnasium\n.\nThe Second Gymnasium was the oldest secondary school in St Petersburg having been founded in\n1806\n. The director of the school was Alexei Ivanovich Davidenkov, who came from a famous St Petersburg family. He had two nephews, one being a leading researcher in mechanics and physics who was a member of the\nUkrainian  Academy of Sciences\nand the other was a famous psychiatrist who was a member of the Academy of Medical Sciences. Davidenkov avoided political involvement and ran the gymnasium as a top class school. Tamarkin was in the same class at the Second Gymnasium as\nAlexander Friedmann\nand the two became very close friends.\nSmirnov\nwas also a pupil at the Second Gymnasium and was one year older than Tamarkin and\nFriedmann\n.\nIn each class Tamarkin and\nFriedmann\nperformed brilliantly and from the fifth form onwards they concentrated hard on their mathematical studies. One amusing fact which the school records show is that Tamarkin was often late for school. In\n1905\nTamarkin and\nFriedmann\nwrote a paper on\nBernoulli numbers\nwhich they submitted to\nHilbert\nfor publication in\nMathematische Annalen\n. The paper was accepted and appeared in print in\n1906\n. The year\n1905\nwas not only one of great scientific importance for Tamarkin, it was also one where he became extremely active politically. Both he and\nFriedmann\nwere student leaders of strikes at the school in protest at the government's repressive measures against schools.\nTamarkin graduated from the Second Gymnasium in\n1906\nwith a gold medal and entered the Physics and Mathematics Faculty of the University of St Petersburg in August of that year. Although he had been keen to become involved in political activity at school, this was much less evident at University as he had to increasingly concentrate on his studies. Valentina Doinikova, who was a friend of\nFriedmann\n, describes how Tamarkin,\nFriedmann\nand\nSmirnov\nwent around together while undergraduates at St Petersburg University:-\nFriedmann, Tamarkin and\nSmirnov\noften came together, and they were called 'the boys from the Second Gymnasium'. They were always smart and neatly dressed, and always called each other - in public - by their first name and patronymic.\nTamarkin maintained his close friendship and academic collaboration with\nFriedmann\nand by\n1908\nthe two were attending lectures by\nSteklov\non partial differential equations. They made lecture notes, which\nSteklov\nchecked, and then they had them printed. Tamarkin and\nFriedmann\nworked on another paper at this time and submitted\nSome formulas pertaining to the theory of the function\n[\nx\n]\nand Bernoulli numbers\nto\nCrelle\n's Journal. It was published in\n1909\n. In April\n1909\nSteklov\nset Tamarkin a project. He wrote in his diary:-\nI proposed to Tamarkin that he think about the asymptotic solution of differential equations\n(\ni.e. stability, in the sense of\nPoincarÃ©\nand\nLyapunov\n)\nor the problem of equilibrium of a rectangular plate.\nTamarkin graduated in\n1910\nwith the equivalent to a Master's degree, then remained at St Petersburg to prepare for the position of professor of mathematics.\nSteklov\n, wrote in a reference for Tamarkin in which he seeks financial support for both him and\nFriedmann\nto continue their studies:-\nI must add that during the twenty years of my teaching career I have never met young people as gifted as these ... They should be retained for science's sake at any cost and should be given the opportunity to dedicate themselves to scientific work without distracting themselves by external pursuits.\nFor his Magister degree, Tamarkin had to both take examinations and also to write a thesis. He took written examinations in\n1912\nand\n1913\n. and then submitted his thesis in\n1917\non boundary value problems for linear differential equations. N M Gunter and\nV A Steklov\nwere appointed to examine the thesis. It was published in English in\nMathematische Zeitschrift\nin\n1928\nas\nSome general problems of the theory of ordinary linear differential equations and expansion of an arbitrary function in series of fundamental functions\n. During the years in which he undertook research for his thesis he led a most varied life, full of music and a number of other activities in addition to his mathematics. For example, in\n1912\n, he was a member of a government commission studying railway accidents. As well as teaching at the University, Tamarkin taught at two other institutions in St Petersburg, namely the Electro-Technical School and the School of Communications. It was during this time\n(\nin\n1914)\nthat St Petersburg changed its name to Petrograd.\nIn\n1919\nTamarkin married Helen Weichart; they had one son. However these were extremely difficult times in Russia. The Revolution of October\n1917\nbecame inevitable when Alexander Kerensky, the prime minister, sent troops to close down two Bolshevik newspapers. Lenin, who had been in hiding, made a public appearance telling the Bolsheviks to overthrow the Government. On the morning of October\n26\n, after hardly any bloodshed, Lenin proclaimed that the Soviets were in power. Soon after this the Russian nation was plunged into civil war. The Red Army was formed in February\n1918\nwith Trotsky as its leader. The Reds opposed the White Army formed of anticommunists led by former imperial officers.\nThe University of Perm opened in\n1916\nas a branch of the University of St Petersburg but in\n1917\nbecame an independent institution. Perm suffered badly in fighting during\n1919\nbeing at times controlled by the Red army and at other times by the White Army.\nFriedmann\nand\nBesicovitch\nhad worked there through the difficult times and in late\n1919\nTamarkin went there too. Both\nFriedmann\nand\nBesicovitch\nreturned to Petrograd\n(\nas St Petersburg was then called\n)\nbut Tamarkin spent two years at Perm until\n1922\nboth as professor and dean of the university. After this he returned to Petrograd, taking up teaching at the three institutions he had previously taught at, and adding a further teaching position at the Naval Academy. Hunter writes\n[\n4\n]\n:-\nHis research during this period continued on boundary value problems, but also included advances in mathematical physics, differential equations, and approximations. As an outgrowth of his teaching activities, he co-authored two mathematics textbooks for engineers.\nIn\n1925\n, feeling uneasy in the new political situation in Russia because he came from a well-off family, he decided to emigrate to the United States. He taught for two years as a visiting lecturer at Dartmouth College and immediately began publishing in the\nTransactions of the American Mathematical Society\nand in the\nAnnals of Mathematics\n. Five papers were published in these journals in\n1926\nand\n1927\n:\nOn Laplace's integral equations; On Volterra's integro-functional equation; A new proof of Parseval's identity for trigonometric functions; On Fredholm's integral equations, whose kernels are analytic in a parameter\n; and\nThe notion of the Green's function in the theory of integro-differential equations\n. In\n1927\nTamarkin was appointed to Brown University where he remained for the rest of his career. Not only did Tamarkin publish in the\nTransactions of the American Mathematical Society\nand in the\nAnnals of Mathematics\nbut he also was an editor of these two journals; the first from\n1927\nto\n1936\n, and the second from\n1928\nto\n1939\n. When\nMathematical Reviews\nbegan publishing in\n1940\nhe became an editor of that publication. As a lecturer he was excellent, giving lectures which\n[\n3\n]\n:-\n... were highly polished and represented up-to-date research.\nTamarkin published a series of papers written jointly with\nHille\nbetween\n1932\nand\n1934\n. For example they published:\nOn the summability of Fourier series\n(\ntwo papers\n)\n,\nOn a theorem of Hahn-Steinhaus, On a theorem of Paley and Wiener, On the theory of linear integral equations\n. He published a major text\nThe Problem of Moments\nwritten jointly with J A Shohat in the\nAmerican Mathematical Society Mathematical Surveys Series\n(1943)\n. The problem of moments is the theory of an infinite system of\nintegral equations\nunder various hypotheses. The book was the first to give a unified and detailed presentation of the deeper theory of the moment problem.\nAn enthusiast for the\nAmerican Mathematical Society\n, he served on its Council from\n1931\n. He was appointed to its Colloquium Committee in\n1937\nand served the Society as vice-president in\n1942\n-\n43\n. In\n1945\nwhen he was\n56\nyears old, Tamarkin suffered a heart attack. He retired from his professorship at Brown University and although for a while he began to recover, he died later in\n1945\n."
