  "biografia": "Joseph Proudman\nwas the son of John Proudman\n(1866\n-\n1943)\nand his wife Nancy Blease\n(1867\n-\n1942)\n. John Proudman, the son of Ralph Proudman of \"\n3\nAcres Farm\" Sevenoaks, was a farm bailiff at Thurston Fold Farm, Unsworth, when he married Nancy Blease in\n1887\nat Prescot, Lancashire. Nancy was the daughter of the police constable Joseph Blease. John and Nancy Proudman had two sons, Joseph Proudman, the subject of this biography, and William Proudman\n(1890\n-\n1959)\n. Joseph was baptised on\n24\nFebruary\n1889\nin the Wesleyan-Methodist Chapel in Unsworth.\nIn\n1894\n, Joseph began his education at the primary school in Unsworth. In\n1898\n, when he was nine years old, the family moved to Bold Heath, about\n6\nmiles north of Widnes in Lancashire, when his father became a small tenant farmer at Nursery Farm. Joseph continued his primary education at the school in Bold Heath until\n1902\nwhen, at the age of thirteen, he became a pupil-teacher at Farnworth primary school between Bold Heath and Widnes\n[\n3\n]\n:-\nHe tells us that in\n1902\nhis salary was Â£\n6\n10\ns. Od. per year, and in\n1907\nit was Â£\n24\nper year. His secondary education was begun by the headmaster, A R Smith, who gave him a lesson each morning from\n8\nto\n8\n.\n45\nbefore the school opened at\n9\n. During the winters of\n1902\n-\n4\nhe attended evening classes at the Widnes Technical School, studying art, mathematics and physiography. From\n1903\nto\n1907\nhe only taught for half of each week; the other half he attended classes at the Widnes Secondary School. This was an excellent school, and it was here that the mathematical bent of his life was determined.\nProudman's home in Bold Heath was about two and a half miles from Farnworth and Farnworth was a further four miles from Widnes so, between\n1903\nand\n1907\n, he was walking about thirteen miles\n(\nabout\n21\nkm\n)\non half the school days. One of his lifetime interests arose at this time, namely reading history. This was a great benefit to writers of his obituary, for, conscious of the need to record history, he left a wealth of autobiographical notes which are still available. He won a Tate Technical Science Entrance Scholarship to study at Liverpool University in\n1907\n, was awarded First Class in the B.Sc. examinations of\n1909\nand received a scholarship to continue to honours. In\n1910\nhe was awarded First Class Honours in Mathematics and, for his outstanding performance, he received the Derby scholarship for mathematics and the Ronald Hudson prize for geometry. The Ronald Hudson prize was awarded on the results of the examination in the Honours School of Mathematics in Geometry. The Derby scholarship funded further study and Proudman went to Trinity College, Cambridge for this. In addition he was also supported by a Trinity College Entrance Exhibition.\nAt Cambridge Proudman matriculated at Trinity College in\n1910\nand studied the Mathematical Tripos taking a wide range of subjects in pure mathematics, applied mathematics and mathematical physics. He had\nErnest Barnes\nas his tutor and he attended courses in pure mathematics given by\nG H Hardy\nand by\nJ E Littlewood\n. He particularly enjoyed the lectures on hydrodynamics and on astronomy, both topics taught by Robert Alfred Herman\n(1861\n-\n1927)\n. The courses on electric waves and on potential theory were delivered by\nThomas J I'A Bromwich\nand it was from the courses by Herman and\nBromwich\n, Proudman later wrote, that he learnt most. Made a senior scholar in\n1911\n, he took the Tripos examinations in\n1912\n, being awarded First Class in schedule A and a distinction in schedule B of Part Two of the Tripos.\nAfter taking the Tripos, Proudman was keen to undertake research in hydrodynamics and approached several of the people who had taught him. None seemed particularly keen to supervise research on the aspects which interested Proudman, and so he ought advice from\nErnest Barnes\nwho suggested he contact\nHorace Lamb\nat the University of Manchester. The first two of Proudman's paper's were published in\n1913\n.\nOn Some Cases of Tidal Motion of Rotating Sheets of Water\nwas communicated by\nHorace Lamb\nto the\nLondon Mathematical Society\nand it was received on\n27\nFebruary\n1913\n. The paper, which appeared in the\nProceedings\n, begins:-\nThe following investigations arose out of an attempt to obtain an expression for the free tidal motion of a rotating flat sheet of water in the form of a circular sector. This was suggested as a subject for research by Prof\nLamb\n. No progress, however, was made with the original problem except in the case of the semicircle, and in this case only when the angular velocity of rotation was small compared with the free periods of the relative motion of the water. Even in this restricted case the resulting expression was so complicated as to make interpretation very difficult, if not impossible, and consequently it is not given below.\nAfter a statement of the general conditions\n(\nwhich were first investigated by\nLord Kelvin\n)\n, and their application to the case of a nearly circular sheet of water, a discussion is given of the limiting forms of forced tides as the period of the disturbing force tends to become infinite. It appears that these limiting forms are, for rotating flat sheets of water of uniform depth, always different from the forms given by the equilibrium theory. The limiting form is calculated for a rectangular sheet, and the result may, perhaps, be of interest, as the complete determination of the tides on such a sheet has not yet been obtained. Some partial solutions are then given, and, finally, the free symmetrical motion is obtained for a particular small circular sea on a sphere, as the next approximation after that which regards the sea as flat.\nWe see that\nLamb\nhad set Proudman on the research path on which he spent the rest of his life.\nThe other paper which appeared in May\n1913\nwas\nNote on the pressure of rotation on a small reflecting sphere\n; it was published in the\nMonthly Notices\nof the\nRoyal Astronomical Society\n. The paper related to ideas which Proudman had discussed with\nBromwich\nwhile at Trinity College, and it was submitted to the\nRoyal Astronomical Society\nby\nBromwich\n. The paper begins:-\nThis problem has been discussed by\nSchwarzschild\nand Professor Nicholson, but their numerical results are not in complete agreement. The analysis of the latter is much the shorter, and it appeared likely that his results were nearer the truth. Dr\nBromwich\n, however, was in possession of an independent treatment which showed that this was not the case as regards the magnitude of the maximum pressure. He informed me of this, and suggested that I should make a fresh calculation, very kindly showing me his results. I have worked through all the cases considered by Professor Nicholson, together with some additional and intermediate ones, and the results are substantially in agreement except as regards the maximum pressure. The present note contains the results referring to this maximum, making the determination much more precise than was done by\nSchwarzschild\n.\nFrank Stanton Carey\nhad been the Professor of Mathematics at the University of Liverpool since\n1886\nand he offered Proudman a lectureship soon after the results of the Tripos examinations were announced. Proudman took up the lectureship in mathematics in October\n1913\n[\n3\n]\n:-\nHe found that being a lecturer was much harder than being a student, either undergraduate or postgraduate. He gave twelve lectures per week, two each morning for\n6\ndays per week. During his first year as a lecturer he had no time for research except during vacations, but he found time to direct the postgraduate work of A T Doodson for the degree of M.Sc. and thus began a collaboration which continued until Doodson's death.\nAlthough he had to concentrate on teaching, research which Proudman had undertaken before taking up the lectureship at Liverpool led to publications in\n1914\n. One of these was\nLimiting Forms of Long Period Tides\n. The introduction begins as follows:-\nAs the equations of tidal motion have been solved in only a few cases, which are very restricted when compared with the actual conditions of terrestrial tides, it is of interest to try to obtain some approximation to the long period tides by means of a discussion of the limiting forms of these tides as the period of the disturbing forces tends to become infinite.\nWorld War I began in\n1914\nbut Proudman was medically unfit for armed service and continued to work in Liverpool. His annual salary as a lecturer was Â£\n150\nwhich was hardly enough to live on\n(\nperhaps the\n2021\nequivalent would be about Â£\n7000)\n. This remained fixed for six years despite a quite high inflation rate. Financially, however, Trinity College came to his rescue for, in\n1915\n, he was made a Fellow with an annual salary of Â£\n350\n. The Fellowship came with no duties and lasted for six years. This gave him the financial security to marry. On\n10\nJuly\n1916\nhe married Rubina Ormrod\n(1891\n-\n1958)\nat Chorlton Upon Medlock, Lancashire. Rubina, the daughter of Thomas and Rebecca Ormrod, had been born in Salford, Lancashire. At the time of the\n1911\ncensus, Rubina was living in Manchester and her occupation is given as Ladies Companion. Joseph and Rubina Proudman had three children, two sons James Proudman\n(\nborn\n1918)\nand Ian Proudman\n(\nborn\n1927)\n, and a daughter Nancy Proudman\n(\nborn\n1924)\n.\nIn\n1919\nProudman succeed in encouraging two Liverpool shipowners to fund the establishment of the Liverpool Tidal Institute for the University of Liverpool and to provide funds to run it for the first five years. Proudman was named as Honorary Director of the Tidal Institute with Arthur Doodson as its Secretary\n[\n6\n]\n:-\nAlthough a separate body, separately governed and funded, there was a very early association with Bidston Observatory. It was intended as a research institution with both theoretical and practical aspects of tidal dynamics as topics of study.\nWe note that the Director of the Liverpool Bidston Observatory was William Plummer, the father of the mathematician and astronomer\nHenry Plummer\n.\nThe University of Liverpool established a Chair of Applied Mathematics so that they could promote Proudman to a professorship and, in\n1919\n, he was appointed as the first Professor of Applied Mathematics at the University of Liverpool. This improved his financial position considerably for in\n1918\nhe had an annual salary of Â£\n150\nwhile two years later his annual salary was Â£\n1000\n. A significant step forward occurred in\n1923\nwhen Proudman was awarded the\nAdams\nPrize by the University of Cambridge for his\nEssay on the Tides\n. In\n1924\nProudman and Doodson published the joint paper\nThe Principal Constituent of the Tides of the North Sea\n, the first four sections being part of Proudman's\nAdams\nPrize Essay. The paper begins:-\nThis paper is concerned exclusively with the principal lunar semi-diurnal harmonic constituent of the tides which is denoted by\nM\n2\nM_{2}\nM\n2\nâ\n. The primary object is to show how the fundamental dynamical equations of the tides may be used to obtain a knowledge of the distribution of the surface-elevation from such observational data as are available. The dynamical equations, as formulated in Â§\n4\n, connect the elevation-gradients with the currents and the external forces, including those of friction. From a knowledge of the currents and a hypothesis for the frictional forces the elevation-gradients can be calculated.\nWhen the elevation is also known the directions of the co-tidal and co-range lines, and also the distance apart of neighbouring members of these lines, can be calculated. Such conditions are fulfilled for coastal stations, and it is remarkable that, in spite of the great attention that has been paid to co-tidal charts, these simple calculations do not appear to have been previously made. But if the elevation-gradients can be calculated along a line which passes through one or more points at which the elevation is known, it is clear that methods can be devised by which the elevation can be calculated all along the line. Again, such calculations do not appear to have been previously made.\nProudman's achievement here was far-reaching, one of the many consequences being that Hydrographic Department saw that his work meant co-tidal charts could be constructed for the North Sea\n[\n6\n]\n:-\nThe association between the\n[\nTidal\n]\nInstitute and Bidston\n[\nObservatory\n]\ngradually strengthened, with William Plummer joining the governing board of the Institute. Significantly a tide-predicting machine was installed at Bidston at the end of\n1924\n. Tide-predicting machines are devices that can be 'programmed' with the harmonic tidal constants for a particular port and then proceed to provide predictions or hindcasts for any desired date. As they required very high precision engineering, very few were in existence and several foreign governments asked the Institute to supervise the construction of machines for their own use.\nIn collaboration with Frank Stanton Carey, by this time the Emeritus Professor of Mathematics at Liverpool, Proudman published the book\nThe Elements of Mechanics\nin\n1925\n.\nHarry Bateman\nwrites\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nThis book by a professor emeritus in the University of Liverpool and a young professor who has made notable advances in the study of the tides is a good example of what can be accomplished when the experience of a great teacher is combined with the brilliance of an ardent investigator. The subject is well presented ...\nFor more information about this book, including extracts from the Preface and some reviews, see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nOceanographic research at Liverpool strengthened with the Liverpool Bidston Observatory and the Liverpool Tidal Institute forming a single institute in\n1929\n[\n6\n]\n:-\nIn\n1928\n, William Plummer died and this may have been the catalyst for the amalgamation of the Observatory and Tidal Institute, which took place on the\n1\nJanuary\n1929\n. This was a pivotal moment as the next decade brought a considerable increase in oceanographic research to Bidston. With Joseph Proudman as Director and Arthur Doodson as Associate Director, the Liverpool Observatory and Tidal Institute developed new methods for the analysis of tides and their prediction, and a second tide-predicting machine was acquired.\nIn\n1933\nProudman requested that he transfer from the Chair of Applied Mathematics to the Chair of Oceanography at the University of Liverpool\n[\n3\n]\n:-\n... it was Proudman's idea that the department should be converted to one of physical oceanography. At that time there was much less provision for marine physics in this country than for marine biology. In addition to widening his own research interests to include oceanic circulation and the distribution of temperature and salinity in oceans and seas, Proudman initiated observational work in the Irish Sea.\nTo study turbulence and internal friction in a tidal current, Proudman and some colleagues purchased a fishing boat, the\nZepyr\nwhich they converted into a research boat and crewed it themselves except for having one professional seaman. The advent of World War II in\n1939\nmeant they could no longer carry out this work and they had to sell the\nZepyr\n. Their experience, however, meant that after the war ended the University of Liverpool purchased a larger boat and employed a professional crew. They resumed their research on turbulence and internal friction and, as a result, wrote several papers such as Proudman's\nOn the mixing of sea-water by turbulence\n(1948)\nand\n(\nwith K F Bowden\n)\nObservations on the turbulent fluctuations of a tidal current\n(1949)\n.\nIn\n1953\nhe published the book\nDynamical Oceanography\n. David Vaux writes in the review\n[\n17\n]\n:-\nProf Proudman's book is written from the mathematical standpoint, but its results and implications are in terms which should be understood by scientists engaged in marine, as well as in physical, oceanography. Before his appointment as Professor of Oceanography at Liverpool University twenty years ago, he had been professor in the department of Applied Mathematics for some fourteen years. His book, therefore, has a particularly sound hydrodynamical background. Results applicable to practical oceanography are deduced from the basic equations of dynamics.\nFor more information about this book, including extracts from the Preface and some reviews, see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nProudman reached retirement age in\n1954\nand was made Professor Emeritus. He left Liverpool, living at first in Shropshire, then in Dorset. On\n6\nMay\n1958\n, his wife Rubina died. He married Beryl Gladys Waugh Barker on\n29\nMay\n1961\nin Poole, Dorset. Beryl, born in Southampton on\n17\nJuly\n1909\n, was the daughter of Walter George Barker and his wife Alice Mary Waugh. Beryl married Basil Frederick Cabourne Bassett in\n1932\nbut, following his death in\n1936\n, she married Donald Jack Gould in\n1939\n. Donald Gould had died in\n1958\n, three years before she married Proudman.\nWe should record a few of the many honours which Proudman received. He was elected a Fellow of the\nRoyal Society of London\nin\n1925\n. On\n13\nOctober\n1944\nhe delivered the\nRoyal Astronomical Society\n's\nGeorge Darwin\nlecture choosing as his title\nThe Tides of the Atlantic Ocean\n. He began his lecture as follows:-\nIt is appropriate, I think, that I should lecture on a subject connected with the tides of the ocean, for Sir\nGeorge Darwin\nhimself gave a great deal of his attention to the subject. From about\n1882\nuntil the end of his life in\n1912\n, he was generally regarded as the greatest living authority on ocean tides.\nTwo years later, in\n1946\n, he was awarded the Alexander Agassiz Medal for\nhis work on oceanography by the\nNational Academy of Sciences\n[\n11\n]\n:-\nThe\nNational Academy of Sciences\nawarded one of its highest honours, the Alexander Agassiz medal, to an English researcher on the mathematics of the oceans' tides, Prof Joseph Proudman, F.R.S., director of the Liverpool Observatory and Tidal Institute. Since Prof Proudman was unable to be present in person, the medal was accepted in his behalf by Sir Alfred Egerton, secretary of the Royal Society of London.\nHe was elected to the\nNorwegian Academy of Science and Letters\nin\n1946\n, was elected Vice-President of the International Association of Physical Oceanography in\n1948\nand its President in\n1951\n. He was honoured with a C.B.E. in\n1952\n. He was awarded an honorary degree by the University of Liverpool in\n1956\nand, in\n1957\n, he was awarded the Hughes Medal by the\nRoyal Society\n.\nHis final home was in Dorset, where he lived in Dewlands Way, Verwood, but he died in a nursing home in Fordingbridge, Hampshire, quite near his home."
