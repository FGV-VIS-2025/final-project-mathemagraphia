  "biografia": "Jean Claude Saint-Venant\nwas a student at the Ãcole Polytechnique, entering the school in\n1813\nwhen he was sixteen years old. He graduated in\n1816\nand spent the next\n27\nyears as a civil engineer. For the first seven of these\n27\nyears Saint-Venant worked for the Service des Poudres et SalpÃªtres, then he spent the next twenty years working for the Service des Ponts et ChaussÃ©es.\nSaint-Venant attended lectures at the CollÃ¨ge de France and the lecture notes he took in\nLiouville\n's\n1839\n-\n40\nclass still survive. He taught mathematics at the Ãcole des Ponts et ChaussÃ©es where he succeeded\nCoriolis\n.\nSaint-Venant worked mainly on mechanics, elasticity, hydrostatics and hydrodynamics. Perhaps his most remarkable work was that which he published in\n1843\nin which he gave the correct derivation of the\nNavier\n-\nStokes\nequations. Anderson writes in\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nSeven years after\nNavier\n's death, Saint-Venant re-derived\nNavier\n's equations for a viscous flow, considering the internal viscous stresses, and eschewing completely\nNavier\n's molecular approach. That\n1843\npaper was the first to properly identify the coefficient of viscosity and its role as a multiplying factor for the velocity gradients in the flow. He further identified those products as viscous stresses acting within the fluid because of friction. Saint-Venant got it right and recorded it. Why his name never became associated with those equations is a mystery. certainly it is a miscarriage of technical attribution.\nWe should remark that\nStokes\n, like Saint-Venant, correctly derived the\nNavier\n-\nStokes\nequations but he published the results two years after Saint-Venant.\nSaint-Venant developed a vector calculus similar to that of\nGrassmann\nwhich he published in\n1845\n. He then entered into a dispute with\nGrassmann\nabout which of the two had thought of the ideas first.\nGrassmann\nhad published his results in\n1844\n, but Saint-Venant claimed\n(\nand there is little reason to doubt him\n)\nthat he had first developed these ideas in\n1832\n. Again it would appear that Saint-Venant was unlucky. Itard writes in\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nSaint-Venant used this vector calculus in his lectures at the Institut Agronomique, which were published in\n1851\nas \"Principes de mÃ©canique fondÃ©s sur la cinÃ©matique\"\nâ\n(\nMechanical principles based on kinematics\n)\n. In this book Saint-Venant, a convinced atomist, presented forces as divorced from the metaphysical concept of cause and from the physiological concept of muscular effort, both of which, in his opinion, obscured force as a kinematic concept accessible to the calculus. Although his atomistic conceptions did not prevail, his use of the vector calculus was adopted in the French school system.\nIn the\n1850\ns Saint-Venant derived solutions for the torsion of non-circular cylinders. He extended\nNavier\n's work on the bending of beams, publishing a full account in\n1864\n. In\n1871\nhe derived the equations for non-steady flow in open channels.\nIn\n1868\nSaint-Venant was elected to succeed\nPoncelet\nin the mechanics section of the\nAcadÃ©mie des Sciences\n. By this time he was\n71\nyears old, but he continued his research and lived for a further\n18\nyears after this time. At age\n86\nhe translated\n(\nwith A Flamant\n)\nClebsch\n's work on elasticity into French and published it as\nThÃ©orie de l'Ã©lasticitÃ© des corps solides\nâ\n(\nTheory of the elasticity of solids\n)\nand Saint-Venant added notes to the text which he wrote himself. Note that Saint-Venant's co-translator A Flamant was a co-author of the obituary notice\n[\n3\n]\nfor Saint-Venant."
