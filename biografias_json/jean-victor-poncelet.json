  "biografia": "Jean-Victor Poncelet\n's father was Claude Poncelet, a rich landowner who was a lawyer at the Parliament of Metz. His mother was Anne-Marie Perrein, but Jean-Victor was an illegitimate child and, although he was born in Metz, he was sent away before he was a year old to be brought up by the Olier family in Saint-Avold, a town to the east of Metz. We should add that much later Claude Poncelet married Anne-Marie Perrein making Jean-Victor legitimate from that time. He was cared for with much love and affection by the Olier family and he lived with them until\n1804\nwhen he reached the age of\n15\n. It was a happy time for Poncelet, who showed great curiosity for all things around him, particularly a love of mechanical objects and he spent many happy hours playing with the mechanism of a clock which had been bought for him.\nWhen he was fifteen years old, Poncelet returned to Metz where he studied at the lycÃ©e taking the special classes designed to prepare students to take the entrance examinations for the Ãcole Normale and the Ãcole Polytechnique. He entered the Ãcole Polytechnique in\n1807\n, and there he had outstanding teachers such as the mathematicians\nGaspard Monge\n,\nLazare Carnot\n,\nCharles Brianchon\n,\nSylvestre Lacroix\n,\nAndrÃ©-Marie AmpÃ¨re\n,\nLouis Poinsot\n, and\nJean Hachette\n. However his health was poor and he missed most of his third year of study. He graduated from the Ãcole Polytechnique in\n1810\nat the age of\n22\n, older than was usual due to taking an extra year because of his health problems, and decided on a military career. He joined the Engineering Corps and went to Metz to study at the Ãcole d'Application. After two years of study he graduated, having reached the rank of Lieutenant and, in March\n1812\n, was given as a first assignment work on the fortifications of Ramekens on the island of Walcheren in the estuary of the river Scheldt\n(\nor Escaut\n)\n[\n21\n]\n:-\nHis first engineering work here was the erection of a casemated fort in a very limited time, on a peat soil, without having at his command proper materials for a foundation.\nHowever he was called away from that assignment in June\n1812\nto take part in Napoleon's Russian campaign.\nPoncelet joined Napoleon's army of\n600\n,\n000\nmen at the town of Vitepsk as it was approaching Russia.  By\n18\nAugust the army was nearing Smolensk, the first genuinely Russian city, and Poncelet reconnoitred the city despite being under fire from the defending garrison. He was actively involved in the fighting later that day, then on the following day he was responsible for constructing bridges over the Dnieper River below Smolensk. Not only did he have to overcome problems of constructing bridges but he had to do so while under fire from Russian guns on the opposite bank. He devised a plan to divert the attention of the Russians to a particular crossing point while he organised building bridges at a different location. It was not until September\n1812\nthat the Russian army fully engaged with the French and were defeated at the Battle of Borodino. Poncelet spent five frustrating weeks with the army in Moscow, then on\n19\nOctober Napoleon ordered the army to withdraw. The Russians then attacked the retreating French army and Poncelet was left for dead on the battlefield following the Battle of Krasnoi, not far from Smolensk, on\n19\nNovember\n[\n21\n]\n:-\nIn this battle, Poncelet charged the Russian batteries at the head of a column of sappers and miners; his horse was killed under him ...\nHe was extremely fortunate to survive but had great hardships to come\n[\n6\n]\n:-\nHe was picked up by enemy soldiers only because they thought that being an officer he might be able to give useful information. As a prisoner of war, he was forced to march for nearly five months across frozen plains to his prison\n[\nSaratov\n]\non the banks of the Volga. At first he was too exhausted, cold and hungry even to think; but when the spring came\n(\n\"the splendid April sun\"\n)\n, he resolved to utilise his time by recalling all he could of his mathematical education. Later he was to apologise that \"deprived of books and comforts of all sorts, distressed above all by the misfortune of my country and my own lot, I was not able to bring these studies to a proper perfection.\"\nHe was held in the prison from March\n1813\nto June\n1814\nwhen he returned to France. During his imprisonment he recalled the fundamental principles of geometry but, forgetting the details of what he had learnt from\nMonge\n,\nCarnot\nand\nBrianchon\n, he went on to develop\nprojective\nproperties of\nconics\n. He called the notes that he made the 'Saratov notebook,' but it was only fifty years later that he incorporated much of what he had written in his treatise on analytic geometry\nApplications d'analyse et de gÃ©omÃ©trie\nâ\n(\nApplications of analysis and geometry\n)\n(1862)\n. His development of the pole and polar lines associated with conics led to the principle of duality but this, as we explain below, led to a priority dispute. He also discovered circular points at infinity. First we look at what\nJulian Coolidge\nwrites about Poncelet's inspired work\n[\n15\n]\n:-\nThe fundamental problem which Poncelet sets himself is to study the graphical properties of figures which he defines as those which do not involve the magnitude either of distances or of angles. The distance of two points is not projectively invariant, but in looking for projectively invariant configurations he finds the harmonic one, and this he develops at length. ... In his second chapter Poncelet attacks the problem of imaginary points in pure geometry with a courage and thoroughness ahead of anything shown by his predecessors. ... he makes quite casually the historic statement that two coplanar circles should not be looked upon as completely independent figures, but as having two imaginary infinite points in common. Here we have the first announcement of one of the basic principles of metrical geometry. Later Poncelet allows, without careful definition, imaginary projections.\nOn\n30\nMay\n1814\nthe Treaty of Paris was signed making peace between France and Russia\n(\nand the other countries involved in the conflict\n)\n. A few days later Poncelet was released from Saratov prison but it took him until September of that year before he reached France. From\n1815\nhe taught at Metz. He published\nTraitÃ© des propriÃ©tÃ©s projectives des figures\nâ\n(\nTreatise on projective properties of figures\n)\nin\n1822\n, which is a study of those properties which remain invariant under projection. Note that the work was subtitled \"A work of utility for those studying the applications of descriptive geometry and geometric operations on land\" and here one can see the influence of\nMonge\n's teaching. This work contains fundamental ideas of projective geometry such as the cross-ratio, perspective, involution and the circular points at infinity. While writing this book he consulted with\nFranÃ§ois Servois\nwhom he had known while he worked at Metz but who had moved to Paris in\n1816\n. In\nTraitÃ© des propriÃ©tÃ©s projectives des figures\nâ\n(\nTreatise on projective properties of figures\n)\n, Poncelet wrote:-\nIf one figure is derived from another by a continuous change and the latter is as general as the former, then any property of the first figure can be asserted at once for the second figure.\nHe illustrated this technique by first noting the theorem from Euclidean geometry which states that the product of segments of intersecting chords in a circle is constant. Poncelet then used his principle to show that if the point of intersection is considered to be outside the circle, one obtains the theorem that the product of the secants and their external segments are constant. No proof is required, Poncelet says, for one simply uses the Euclidean theorem and invokes his principle of continuity. It is worth remarking that our term \"projective geometry\" comes from the title of this book, which is quite appropriate since Poncelet was one of the founders of modern projective geometry simultaneously discovered by\nJoseph Gergonne\n. Let us look briefly at\nAndrei Nikolaevich Kolmogorov\n's description\n[\n4\n]\n:-\nPoncelet showed that a conic section\n(\nconic\n)\nis a projective figure and that to solve a difficult problem in conics, one should project the conic, solve the problem for the circle, and then carry out the inverse projection. Since the \"points of convergence\" of parallel lines on the \"mapped plane\" do not correspond to real points of the projective plane, Poncelet added \"ideal\" or \"infinitely distant\" points to all planes, points that project to \"points of convergence.\" Poncelet introduced infinitely distant points using\nCarnot\n's principle of correlation, which he called \"the principle of continuity.\" Developing an idea of\nCarnot\non \"complex correlation,\" Poncelet introduced imaginary points of the plane, and, in particular, imaginary infinitely distant points, such as, for example, \"cyclic points\" - points belonging to all circles in the plane. Two conics can intersect in four real or imaginary points, and two circles in two real and two cyclic points.\nThe principle of continuity caused some disputes. In particular\nAugustin-Louis Cauchy\n, writing a report on Poncelet's work on\n5\nJune\n1820\n, claimed that the principle of continuity was \"capable of leading to manifest errors\". He gave an example to show that the principle was false, but his example was not correct. This was not the only dispute that Poncelet was involved in. Articles appearing in\nJoseph Gergonne\n's\nAnnales des MathÃ©matique\nwhich used the principle of duality gave Poncelet little credit. He protested his priority to\nGergonne\nin December\n1826\nand his comments were published in March\n1827\naccompanied by critical remarks added by\nGergonne\n. The priority dispute about duality lasted until May\n1829\nand also involved\nJulius PlÃ¼cker\n. It pushed Poncelet away from his work on projective geometry and towards mechanics.\nFrom\n1815\nto\n1825\nhe was a Captain of Engineers at Metz, overseeing the construction of machinery in the arsenal at Metz and teaching mechanics in the military college. During this time\nFranÃ§ois Arago\nurged him to accept the position of Professor of Mechanics at Metz but for a while he hesitated. Finally on\n1\nMay\n1824\nhe agreed, taking up his duties in January\n1825\n. He held this position for ten years. He applied mechanics to improve turbines and waterwheels more than doubling the efficiency of the waterwheel\n[\n5\n]\n:-\nPoncelet was familiar with\nBorda\n's work and the necessity for an efficient water wheel of having water enter without velocity and leave without impact. The basic problem he faced in redesigning the undershot wheel was how to accomplish this while retaining the practical advantages of the traditional construction - simplicity, low construction costs, high rotational velocity. Poncelet declared: \"After having reflected on this, it seemed to me that we could fulfil this double condition by replacing the straight blades on ordinary wheels with curved or cylindrical blades, presenting their concavity to the current.\" Thus, in\n1823\n, Poncelet took the old undershot wheel and replaced its flat, radial blades with curved blades and angled its sluice gate to bring the water as close to the lower blades as possible. These changes produced a wheel with all of the advantages of the undershot wheel plus a relatively high efficiency.\nThese ideas were published by Poncelet in\n1826\nand were awarded a prize by the French government. It is hard for us to understand how important this work was for at this time much of industry was powered by waterwheels. He also collaborated with\nArthur Morin\non experiments on friction beginning in May\n1831\n. Their work confirmed and extended\nCoulomb\n's work on friction, verifying the three general laws he had proposed.\nPoncelet was promoted to Chef de Bataillon in\n1831\n, and then moved to Paris in\n1834\nwhen he was elected in March of that year to the mechanics section of the\nAcadÃ©mie des Sciences\n. His work on projective geometry was too controversial, particularly following the attacks made on it earlier by\nCauchy\n, for him to enter the Academy on the strength of these contributions. In the following year he become Professor of Mechanics at the Sorbonne. He served on the Committee for Fortifications of Paris from\n1835\nto\n1848\n. In\n1842\n, Poncelet married Louise Palmyre Gaudin and his intention was to have a quieter time, but events conspired to prevent this for several years. In\n1841\nhe became a Lieutenant-Colonel, then three years later became Colonel and, on\n19\nApril\n1848\n, a General of Brigade. He also became director of the Ãcole Polytechnique in April\n1848\n, holding the post until\n1850\n. During his time in this role there occurred in Paris the \"June Days Uprising\" by French workers on\n23\n-\n26\nJune\n1848\n. Barricades were set up and the army attacked the workers with a large loss of life. Poncelet, as director of the Ãcole Polytechnique, led his students through the barricades to the Luxembourg Palace where they protected the Provisional Government. Louis EugÃ¨ne Cavaignac, who had become French head of state and led the suppression of the revolt, honoured Poncelet for his support by appointing him to take command of the National Guards of the Department of the Seine. He was later elected to the governing assembly. In\n1849\nPoncelet and\nArthur Morin\ninvented the dynamometer of rotation, which together with later refinements, became the basic investigative tool in the study of work.\nIn\n1851\nthe Great Exhibition of the Works of Industry of all Nations was held in Hyde Park, London. Poncelet was appointed as head of the Scientific Commission for the Exhibition. On his return he wrote a report on progress in the applications of science in the first half of the nineteenth century making particular mention of the English machinery and tools he had seen exhibited. Prompted by the Great Exhibition of\n1851\n, the French organised the first Universal Exhibition which opened in Paris in May\n1855\n. Poncelet also played an important role in this Exhibition.\nPoncelet published many articles on geometry and mechanics in addition to those we have mentioned, particularly in\nGergonne\n's\nAnnales des MathÃ©matique\nand\nCrelle\n's Journal. The lectures he gave at Metz were first produced in lithographed form then, after a series of versions, were eventually published. For example the course on Mechanics Applied to Machines appeared first as lithographed notes in\n1826\n, again as a second version in\n1832\n, then a third definitive version with the assistance of his friend\nArthur Morin\nin\n1836\n. The notes were not properly published, however, until\n1874\n. The course notes\nMÃ©canique industrielle\nâ\n(\nIndustrial Mechanics\n)\nwent through a similar process. He also wrote many reports and memoirs which were published in the MÃ©morial du GÃ©nie and the Avis du ComitÃ© des Fortifications. For example we mention\nSustaining Walls; Geometrical Constructions to Determine Their Thickness Under Various Circumstances: Geometrical Constructions to Determine Their Thickness Under Various Circumstances\n(1845)\n, and\nMemoir Upon the Stability of Revetments and of Their Foundations\n. Publications following his retirement in\n1850\ninclude\nApplications d'analyse et de gÃ©omÃ©trie\nâ\n(\nApplications of analysis and geometry\n)\nin two volumes:\n1862\nand\n1864\n. He also published a second edition of\nTraitÃ© des propriÃ©tÃ©s projectives des figures\nâ\n(\nTreatise on projective properties of figures\n)\nin\n1865\n-\n66\nwhich was reprinted in\n1995\n. Here is a list of the contents of this second edition:\n(1)\nGeneral principles\n(\nconsisting of Preliminary notions of central projection; Preliminary notions on secants and ideal chords of conic sections; and Principles related to projection of plane figures\n)\n.\n(2)\nFundamental properties of straight lines, circles, and conic sections\n(\nconsisting of Geometry of ruler and transversals; Figures inscribed in and circumscribed around conic sections. Reciprocal poles and polars; and Similarity and homothety, centre of similarity\n)\n.\n(3)\nSystems of conic sections\n(\nconsisting of Homologous figures, center and axis of homology, in particular for conic sections; Complete systems of conic sections; and Double contact of conic sections\n)\n.\n(4)\nOn angles and polygons\n(\nthis section contains the projective definition of foci of conic sections\n)\n.\n(5)\nGeneral theory of centers of middle harmonics.\n(6)\nGeneral theory of reciprocal polars.\n(7)\nAnalysis of transversals applied to geometric curves and surfaces.\n(8)\nProperties common to systems of geometric curves and surfaces of arbitrary order.\nPoncelet received many honours in addition to being elected to the\nAcademy\nwhich we mentioned above. He was an officer of the Legion of Honour, and Chevalier of the Prussian Order. Many academies and learned societies elected him to membership including the\nRoyal Society of London\n, the\nBerlin Academy of Science\n, the\nImperial Academy of Sciences of St Petersburg\nand Academy of Sciences in Turin.\nAfter a long and painful illness, Poncelet died in December\n1867\n. In the following year the Prix Poncelet was endowed by his wife in carrying out Poncelet's dying wish that the sciences be advanced. The prize, augmented by a further sum of money, was awarded for work in pure mathematics or mechanics by the\nAcademy of Sciences\nfrom\n1876\n. His unpublished manuscripts survived until World War I when they vanished and have not been traced since. Sadly it is highly likely that they were destroyed at this time."
