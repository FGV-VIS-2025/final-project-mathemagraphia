  "biografia": "Raimundo Chela\nwas the son of JuliÃ¡n Chela and Emilia Aboudib. Julian and Emilia were born and brought up in Mount Lebanon, at that time part of the Ottoman Empire. JuliÃ¡n Chela is in fact the Spanish version of his Lebanese name Khalil Chahla, which he adopted in Venezuela. Both JuliÃ¡n and Emilia were from Christian families and many such families left Lebanon and emigrated to South America beginning around\n1862\nfollowing a period of religious tension. When JuliÃ¡n and Emilia emigrated in the first decade of the\n20\nth century it was not because of religious tension, which was a thing of the past in the area they lived in, but rather it was to seek a better life.\nRaimundo, however, said his parents often told him about their days in Lebanon, speaking of the towns of Zagharta and Aioun, famed for its cedars and situated in a beautiful area.\nThe Chela family arrived in Venezuela at a time of transition when the government of JosÃ© Cipriano Castro Ruiz was replaced by Juan Vicente GÃ³mez ChacÃ³n who seized power in\n1908\n. There was conflict in Venezuela for many years after that, but CarÃºpano, in Sucre state, where JuliÃ¡n Chela lived was a peaceful place without social or political disturbances. JuliÃ¡n and Emilia Chela had eight children, seven girls and one son, Raimundo, the subject of this biography. Raimundo studied at an elementary school in CarÃºpano, then went to Caracas where he attended Secondary School. His parents moved to Caracas at this time. After graduating from High School, he entered the Faculty of Engineering of the Central University of Venezuela. This university in Caracas was founded in\n1721\nmaking it the oldest university in Venezuela and one of the oldest in the Americas. At this university he was a student of\nFrancisco JosÃ© Duarte\n, who was professor of geometry, algebra, analysis and mechanics in the Faculty of Engineering of the Central University of Venezuela from\n1936\nto\n1939\n. Chela had great admiration for\nDuarte\nall his life and we quote later in this biography an extract from a speech he gave on the occasion of awarding\nDuarte\nand Honorary Doctorate on\n28\nMay\n1965\n.\nIn\n1939\nChela married Mercedes Flores, the daughter of the journalist Manuel Flores Cabrera who had been the leader of the struggle against the dictator Juan Vicente GÃ³mez. Raimundo and Mercedes had six children, including Godsuno Chela Flores, born in\n1940\n, and JuliÃ¡n Chela-Flores, born in\n1942\n. We shall say a little about these two children below.\nAfter two years at the Central University of Venezuela, Chela entered the National Pedagogical Institute\n[\n12\n]\n:-\nThe Pedagogical Institute of Caracas began its work as a teacher training establishment on\n30\nSeptember\n1936\n. It has seen, therefore, over\n80\nyears of uninterrupted work. Its creation responded to the need to promote secondary education in the country, which until then had been neglected. As Don Mariano PicÃ³n Salas said: \"the idea was not only to train high school teachers, but to create a centre for the development and cultivation of the humanities and science.\" The year\n1936\nmarked a milestone in the country's historical process. It was a time of transition due to the physical disappearance of the dictator Juan Vicente GÃ³mez, who had stayed in power for\n27\nuninterrupted years. It was a time for great changes ...\nChela graduated with the qualification Teacher of Mathematics in\n1942\n. After graduating he began teaching mathematics at different educational institutions. He taught at the Normal School for Women which had been founded in\n1893\nto train graduates to serve as teachers, both in primary schools and in secondary schools. He also taught at the Industrial Technical School which had been founded in\n1937\nbased on the School of Arts and Crafts of Caracas. Chela also taught in two High Schools, the Liceo AplicaciÃ³n and the Liceo FermÃ­n Toro and at the National Pedagogical Institute where he had been trained. In\n1949\nhe began teaching at the Faculty of Engineering of the Central University of Venezuela.\nDuring this period he published various works, for example\nMathematics and Logic\n(1944)\n,\nTrigonometric Applications of Ptolemy's Theorem\n(1945)\nand\nNumber Systems\n(1945)\nappeared in the\nJournal\nof the National Pedagogical Institute. He also published his Algebra Course as an\n800\n-page work in\n1957\n.\nWalter Beyer writes\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nChela's academic work encompassed other facets: participation in the reforms to secondary education programs; dictation of conferences, short courses and workshops for the improvement of teachers; writing notes for Mathematics courses; directing degree studies; works such as his 'Algebra Course'\n(1957)\n; publication in various journals of his thoughts on the Didactics of Mathematics. Also in various interviews he explained his ideas about the teaching/learning of Mathematics.\nChela was one of\n33\nteachers who founded the College of Teachers of Venezuela on\n22\nJune\n1943\n. Another of the\n33\nwas JosÃ© Manuel Siso MartÃ­nez who was Minister of Education in the Venezuelan government. The political situation changed when in\n1948\nthere was a coup and the country was run by a Government Junta which suppressed political parties. In\n1952\nthe military took over with Marcos PÃ©rez JimÃ©nez as dictator. JosÃ© Manuel Siso MartÃ­nez, the former Minister of Education, was exiled to Mexico\n[\n13\n]\n:-\nWhen Marcos PÃ©rez JimÃ©nez became dictator, the dreams of Venezuelan education dissipated and vanished. However, despite the repression, the College of Teachers of Venezuela continued to promote its academic doctrine through documents and even created a subsidy fund to help exiled teachers, whose purpose was to defend the teaching career and also the institution, highlighting the solidarity of Venezuelan society.\nIn the midst of these events, Chela was elected as President of the College of Teachers of Venezuela and had to deal with the consequences of repression. He served as President in\n1952\n-\n53\n. The dictatorship of Marcos PÃ©rez JimÃ©nez ended in\n1958\nwhen, in January of that year, there was a general uprising and the dictator was overthrown on\n23\nJanuary. Democracy was restored with the establishment of the Fourth Republic of Venezuela. The year\n1958\nalso marks the creation of the Faculty of Sciences.\nEnrique Planchart\nwrites\n[\n9\n]\n:-\nChela had been one of the actors in the creation of the College and having deep social convictions, he had dreamed of a College integrated into national life. The first time I heard him speak was as Orator of Order in the Act of Creation of the Faculty of Sciences of the Central University of Venezuela, in the year\n1958\n. It was an Academic Act of great solemnity, presided over by the Rector Francisco de Venanzi. Without a doubt, this act marks a milestone in the history of Mathematics in Venezuela, it was the first Faculty of Sciences in the country and soon the first Mathematics graduates in Venezuela would graduate.\nRafael PizaniÂ\n(1909\n-\n1997)\nwas heading a Commission to reform universities when the\n1948\ncoup took place and he was expelled in\n1951\n. He returned in\n1958\nwhen democracy was restored and was appointed as Minister of Education. He offered Chela the position of Director of the National Pedagogical Institute but he turned down the offer because he had already decided that he wanted to undertake research for a Ph.D. He replied to PizaniÂ\n[\n4\n]\n:-\nI am a mathematician, what I want is to study.\nWith a scholarship from the Council for Scientific and Humanistic Development of the Central University of Venezuela, Chela went to England to undertake research at the University of London for a Ph.D. In London he studied at King's College where his thesis studies were supervised by\nAlbrecht FrÃ¶hlich\n. He was awarded the degree in\n1961\nfor his thesis\nGalois Groups of Polynomials\nand results from the thesis were published in\n1963\nin the\nJournal\nof the\nLondon Mathematical Society\nin the paper\nReducible polynomials\n. Chela writes in that paper:-\nThis paper is part of a Ph.D. thesis submitted this year to the University of London. I wish to thank my supervisor Dr\nA FrÃ¶hlich\nfor his guidance and encouragement, the Universidad Central of Venezuela for the grant and the Department of Mathematics of the King's College for the facilities which enabled me to pursue my course of study.\nBoth Godsuno Chela Flores and JuliÃ¡n Chela-Flores went to London with their father and studied at the University of London. JuliÃ¡n Chela-Flores was awarded a Ph.D. in quantum mechanics from the University of London in\n1969\n. He became a leading astrobiologist and physicist. Godsuno Chela Flores was awarded a B.A. by the University of London in\n1965\n, and a Postgraduate Diploma in Phonetics, also from London, in\n1967\n. He studied Linguistic History of English at the University of Oxford, and completed a Master's Degree in Applied Linguistics at the University of Essex in\n1972\n. He became a professor of linguistics at the Universidad del Zulia in Maracaibo, Venezuela.\nOn the last days of\n1961\nChela left England and returned to Venezuela. By January\n1962\nhe was back in Caracas where he was met by the Head of Mathematics at the Central University of Venezuela. On\n16\nFebruary, he wrote to his son JuliÃ¡n saying\n[\n5\n]\n:-\nI have been received with signs of affection by everyone here. They have invited me many times to eat, former students, friends, professors, deans, etc. Tomorrow, for example, I am going to have lunch at the house of Isabel my sister and at night with the teachers of the Pedagogical Institute.\nIn a speech of the\n1\nst Venezuelan Congress of Mathematics in MÃ©rida in\n1977\n, Chela spoke about his return to Central University of Venezuela in\n1962\n(\nsee\n[\n9\n]\n)\n:-\nUpon my return to Venezuela in January\n1962\nI was appointed Head of the Department of Mathematics and I found that the organisation of the studies of the Mathematics Degree corresponded to those of a Graduate School, but without the previous base that graduate students have in developed countries such as England, the United States, France, etc. It was evident that under these conditions the number of graduates that the School would produce each year would be very small; but it was argued we should sustain this state of affairs, since the graduate's field of work would be university teaching, in the same Faculty of Sciences or in other Faculties. However, this is not how developed countries proceed, where some of the mathematics graduates are integrated into the plans, at a certain level, of industrial development, secondary school teaching, scientific journalism, etc., and only a minority go on to the doctorate with aspirations to pure scientific research and university teaching ...\n[\nThis is of\n]\nsuch importance not only to raise the scientific level of the people, without which scientific activity eventually becomes impoverished and may even die, but also to gather understanding and support from vast sectors of the population.\nIn April\n1962\nChela was elected a Corresponding Member of the\nAcademy of Physical, Mathematical and Natural Sciences of Venezuela\n.\nEnrique Planchart\nwas a student in the Department of Mathematics and described in\n[\n9\n]\nhow Chela interacted with his students soon after taking over as Head of Mathematics in\n1962\n:-\n... in the cafeteria of the Faculty of Humanities, behind Engineering, Raimundo Chela shared a table with several students from the School of Mathematics: JosÃ© MasÃ³n, Federico Martin and myself. We drank coffee, sometimes several, and we talked. Chela recounted the emotion that the end of 'The Song of the Earth' produced in him, how the music slowly faded away and the mezzo-soprano sang softer and softer Ewig, Ewig, Ewig, ... I noticed how the hairs on his arm bristled as he spoke. I heard 'The Song of the Earth' for the first time some eight years later and I vividly remembered that conversation with Chela; at that moment, I shared his feeling. Whenever I listen to it, the memory of Professor Chela comes back to me.\n...\nAfter jokes, comments about music or poetry and discussing politics\n(\nalways politics for hours\n)\n, the conversation would move to Mathematics: Number Theory or\nGalois\nTheory, most of the time. Also, frequently, stories and anecdotes about famous mathematicians. Chela's mathematical culture was very extensive and he could talk about many topics not related to Algebra. ...\n...\nThese conversations in the cafeteria played a very important role in the formation of many of us. They were motivating, many times we would leave the cafeteria to study something new or to review topics that we thought we had understood. They were also conversations of great spiritual and cultural depth. Apart from two or three jokes, which were never lacking, Chela was a very serious, upright man, with strong convictions and not at all willing to negotiate, much less to betray his principles. This character led, in the following years, to a notable change in his attitude, to a certain degree of visible bitterness and a distance from many of his students and fellow professors at the Faculty of Sciences.\nChela was elected to serve a second term as President of the College of Teachers of Venezuela in\n1963\n-\n65\n.\nOn\n28\nMay\n1965\n, Chela was asked to deliver the address at the ceremony where\nFrancisco JosÃ© Duarte\nwas being awarded an honorary doctorate by the Central University of Venezuela. Chela could speak from much personal experience since he had been taught by\nDuarte\nand had also been a colleague for many years. In his emotional tribute, Chela recalled that\nDuarte\ngraduated in Europe\n[\n4\n]\n:-\n... he filled with his vast knowledge, with his works and with the zeal in caring for, increasing and defending, mathematical science in Venezuela, the void left in the University with the absence of a Department of Pure Mathematics ... But in this task he was practically alone for many years. I imagine him captain of a ship with a very small crew, moving to all the places where his presence and scientific generosity were needed.\nChela was invited as a keynote speaker at the First Venezuelan Congress of Mathematics which took place in MÃ©rida on\n17\n-\n20\nMarch\n1977\n. He discussed the teaching of school and university mathematics, the shortage of mathematics teachers, the development of mathematics departments in universities, and postgraduate studies and mathematical research. In\n1979\nthe National Council for Scientific and Technological Research awarded him the National Prize for Science, which he accepted with his usual humility. This led to him being interviewed by ArÃ­stides Bastidas who asked him why teaching mathematics was a failure. He replied\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nFrom the first grades we badly condition the students in front of us. This occurs because small errors in learning mathematics are penalised in a severe way as it is not done with other subjects.\nAsked whether someone is born with a vocation for mathematics, he replied\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nI do not believe that is the case.\nGauss\n, who together with\nArchimedes\nand\nNewton\nis part of the great universal trilogy of mathematicians, was about to dedicate himself to philology.\nBastidas explained that Chela considers that the development of mathematics should be done in accordance with the service that it has to provide in the course of industrial processes and in the effort by Venezuela against underdevelopment. In fact, he believed that no country could plan its goals without taking advantage in a major way of what is offered by mathematics. Bastidas then asked Chela if the Faculty of Sciences shared these views of his. He gave what looks a bit like a politician's answer when he replied\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nIt is that we can no longer think that this field can be promoted in isolation from the world surrounding the University. We must establish an active connection between the mathematics that we teach and the centres that are going to use it.\nIn\n[\n1\n]\n, published in\n1979\n, Bastidas paid this tribute to Chela:-\nThis country owes a debt to Professor Chela that it will never be able to repay, not only because of his forty-two uninterrupted years of teaching or because of the depth of his knowledge displayed with the most genuine modesty, but also because of the international credit of his professional research, one of which won the honour of being reproduced in the London Journal of Mathematics, where he did a brilliant postgraduate degree, by the way.\nHe had many interests and talents in addition to mathematics and his son Godsono writes\n[\n4\n]\n:-\nHe had a special talent for music and played the piano with singular sensitivity, wrote poetry and participated in the literary and musical groups of little Caracas at the time. He saw no discord between everything he did and felt, and above all he delighted in being a mathematician ...\nFollowing Chela's death, which was the result of an accident,\nAlbrecht FrÃ¶hlich\nwrote to JuliÃ¡n Chela-Flores\n[\n5\n]\n:-\nI remember your father very well and I thoroughly enjoyed having him work under me, and seeing his delight in learning and doing Mathematics.\nWalter Beyer writes\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nChela left behind an indelible mark on those who had the pleasure of knowing him and sharing his wisdom, his deep knowledge and his gift with people. On\n9\nMay\n1985\n, at the National Pedagogical Institute, a heartfelt tribute was held to this distinguished Venezuelan, which was attended by relatives, former students, friends and colleagues who recalled and highlighted various aspects of the work and life of Raimundo Chela.\nLet us end with two quotes by Chela. First a message that he sent to members of the College of Teachers of Venezuela when he was its president\n[\n11\n]\n:-\nI wish to all Venezuelan educators primarily the following two objectives:\ni\n)\nthat daily work is always aimed at achieving an ever-increasing understanding and mastery of the topics that they have to teach;\nii\n)\nmaintain union unity to obtain better working conditions that allow them to deploy an intense and creative teaching effort.\nOur second quote is in a letter he sent to his son JuliÃ¡n on\n19\nMarch\n1962\n[\n5\n]\n:-\nDo not despair if you cannot solve certain problems. The greatest difficulty consists in not forgetting the problem, without despairing. Those two qualities constitute the most powerful weapon. In the culture of mathematics there is a true spirit that will never die because it has the wonderful quality of renewing itself, of changing its fundamental conceptions, whenever the reality of things requires it."
