  "biografia": "George Berkeley\n's father was William Berkeley and his mother is believed to have been Elisabeth Southerne, although this has not been verified with complete certainty. William Berkeley was a gentleman farmer whose family originally came from Staffordshire in England while Elisabeth Southerne was the daughter of a Dublin brewer. George grew up in Dysert Castle, near Thomastown, which his father owned. He entered the Duke of Ormonde's School in Kilkenny in July\n1696\nand studied there until January\n1700\nand then, although still not fifteen years of age, he entered Trinity College, Dublin. He matriculated in March\n1700\n, just after he reached the age of fifteen as a pensioner, meaning that he did not have a scholarship and paid for his own keep in College. In\n1701\nhe was elected to an Erasmus Smith exhibition, and was awarded a scholarship in the following year. He graduated with a B.A. in the spring of\n1704\n.\nStewart writes\n[\n3\n]\n:-\nAfter graduating he prepared an elementary textbook in which he explored the basis of arithmetical notation and the principal arithmetical processes as functions of that notation, explaining these without resort to algebraic or geometrical techniques. He published this in\n1707\nas \"Arithmetica\", jointly with a further set of studies entitled \"Miscellanea mathematica\" ... and indicated that mathematics had been his primary interest for three years.\nBerkeley was working on these mathematics texts, whose full title is\nArithmetica absque Algebra aut Euclide demonstrata\n(\nArithmetic demonstrated without algebra or Euclid\n)\n, waiting for the chance to compete for a fellowship. In\n1706\na College Fellowship became available and, after taking some extremely demanding competitive examinations, he became a Junior Fellow of Trinity College, Dublin on\n9\nJune\n1707\n. Later in that year, on\n19\nNovember, he read his article\nOf infinites\nto the Dublin Philosophical Society, but this mathematical and philosophical work was only published after his death. This work, as the previous mathematical ones, clearly shows that Berkeley was much influenced by Locke. As well as carrying out some light tutoring duties, he studied divinity and was ordained deacon in February\n1709\nand ordained a priest in the following year. During this time he published two important works,\nAn Essay towards a New Theory of Vision\nin\n1709\nand\nA Treatise concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge\nin\n1710\n. The purpose of the first, as stated by Berkeley, is:-\n... to show the manner wherein we perceive by sight the distance, magnitude, and situation of objects. Also to consider the difference there is between the ideas of sight and touch, and whether there is any idea common to both senses.\nIn the second work he examines abstract ideas. He states in the introduction the notions he discusses in depth:-\nIt is agreed on all hands, that the qualities or modes of things do never really exist each of them apart by itself, and separated from all others, but are mixed, as it were, and blended together, several in the same object. But we are told, the mind being able to consider each quality singly, or abstracted from those other qualities with which it is united, does by that means frame to itself abstract ideas. ... Not that it is possible for colour or motion to exist without extension: but only that the mind can frame to itself by abstraction the idea of colour exclusive of extension, and of motion exclusive of both colour and extension.\nBerkeley sent\nA Treatise concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge\nto Samuel Clarke and\nWilliam Whiston\n.\nSee\nTHIS LINK\nfor Whiston's comments.\nAlthough Berkeley continued to hold his fellowship at Trinity College, Dublin, until\n1724\n, he spent most of the period from\n1713\nto\n1724\naway from Dublin. He went to London in January\n1713\nwhere he arranged publication of some of his works. In November of that year he set off for Italy as chaplain to Lord Peterborough. He wrote:-\nGreen fields and groves, flowery meadows and purling streams, are no where in such perfection as in England: but if you would know lightsome days, warm suns, and blue skies, you must come to Italy, and to enable a man to describe rocks and precipices, it is absolutely necessary that he pass the Alps.\nHe returned to England in August\n1714\nand towards the end of the year he had a fever which\nArbuthnot\ndescribed with a joke aimed at Berkeley's philosophy:-\n19\nOctober\n1714\n:\n... poor philosopher Berkeley has now 'the idea of health', which was very hard to produce in him; for he had 'an idea' of a strange fever on him so strong, that it was very hard to destroy it by introducing a contrary one\n.\nBerkeley returned to Italy in\n1716\nwith George Ashe, son of the Trinity College provost, and he spent four years there. He gives a vivid description of the eruption of Vesuvius in\n1717\n:-\nApril\n17\n,\n1717\n: ... with much difficulty I reached the top of Mount Vesuvius, in which I saw a vast aperture full of smoke, which hindered the seeing its depth and figure. I heard within that horrid gulf certain odd sounds, which seemed to proceed from the belly of the mountain; a sort of murmuring, sighing, throbbing, churning ... June\n5\n, after a horrid noise, the mountain was seen at Naples to spew a little out of the crater. The same continued the sixth. The seventh, nothing was observed till within two hours of night, when it began a hideous bellowing, which continued all that night and the next day till noon, causing the windows, and, as some affirm, the very houses in Naples to shake. From that time it spewed vast quantities of molten stuff to the South, which streamed down the side of the mountain like a great pot boiling over.\nOn the journey back to England Berkeley spent some time in Lyon where he wrote the essay\nDe motu\n(\nOn motion\n)\nwhich he submitted for the Grand Prix of the\nAcademy of Sciences\n. He was not successful. He reached London early in\n1721\nand by the start of the\n1721\n-\n22\nacademic year he was in Dublin where he was now a Senior Fellow\n(\na position to which he had been appointed in\n1717\nwhile in Italy\n)\n. He took on additional duties such as\n[\n3\n]\n:-\n... librarian, junior dean, Greek lecturer, divinity lecturer, senior proctor, and Hebrew lecturer.\nIn May\n1724\nBerkeley resigned his position at Trinity College to become Anglican Dean of Londonderry, but he never resided in the city spending most of the next four years in London. Over these years he planned to establish a College in Bermuda to train the sons of colonists and Native Americans whom he wished to convert to:-\n... religion, morality, and civil life.\nFunds of\n10000\npounds for Berkeley's project were promised after the House of Commons in London voted:-\nThat an humble address be presented to his majesty, that out of the lands in St Christopher's, yielded by France to Great Britain by the treaty of Utrecht, his majesty would be graciously pleased to make such grant for the use of the president and fellows of the college of St Paul, in Bermuda, as his majesty shall think proper.\nOn\n1\nAugust\n1728\nhe married Anne Foster, and soon after they set sail for America. They reached Newport, Rhode Island, and bought a farm. Their first two children Henry and George were born while the family lived near Newport, Rhode Island. There he waited for the\n10000\npound grant to be paid which would enable him to build the planned College. However, by the middle of\n1731\nit became obvious that he would not receive the grant, and he returned to London in October. He wrote a number of articles during his time in America which he published in the two or three years after his return.\nIn January\n1734\nBerkeley was appointed Bishop of Cloyne and was consecrated in St Paul's Church, Dublin, on\n19\nMay\n1734\n. In this office he devoted himself to the social and economic plight of Ireland, doing his best as an Anglican bishop to help the conditions of all in the predominantly Roman Catholic country. In\n1745\n, at the time of the Jacobite rebellion, Berkeley addressed Roman Catholics in his diocese, and in\n1749\nhe addressed to the Roman Catholic Clergy\nA Word to the Wise\n. He received a reply in the Dublin Journal of\n18\nNovember\n1749\nin which the Catholic Clergy expressed:-\n... their sincere and hearty thanks to the worthy author, assuring him that they are determined to comply with every particular recommended in his address to the utmost of their power. ... in every page\n[\nBerkeley's address\n]\ncontains a proof of the author's extensive charity; his views are only towards the public good; the means he prescribes are easily complied with; and his manner of treating persons in their circumstances so very singular, that they plainly show the good man, the polite gentleman, and the true patriot.\nHe was devoted to Cloyne and he always purchased his clothes locally even though this meant that they were not of top quality, but he wanted to support employment. He set up a school to teach spinning to children, and he wanted to make possible the manufacture of linen. He wrote:-\nThe children begin to find a pleasure in being paid in hard money; which I understand they will not give to their parents, but keep to buy clothes for themselves ... I am building a workhouse for sturdy vagrants, and design to raise about two acres of hemp for employing them.\nBerkeley is best known in the world of mathematics for his attack on the logical foundation of the calculus as developed by\nNewton\n. In his tract\nThe analyst: or a discourse addressed to an infidel mathematician\n, published in\n1734\n, he tried to argue that although the calculus led to true results its foundations were no more secure than those of religion. He declared that the calculus involved a logical fallacy of a shift in the hypothesis. He described derivatives as follows:-\nAnd what are these fluxions? The velocities of evanescent increments. And what are these same evanescent increments? They are neither finite quantities, nor quantities infinitely small, nor yet nothing. May we not call them ghosts of departed quantities?\nBerkeley's criticisms were well founded and important in that they focused the attention of mathematicians on a logical clarification of the calculus. He developed an ingenious theory to explain the correct results obtained, claiming that it was the result of two compensating errors. Ren writes in\n[\n30\n]\n:-\nBy reviewing Berkeley's lifetime and the content of the \"Analysts\", we conclude that his critique was correct and that it impelled the improvement of the foundations of calculus objectively. It is helpful for the normal development of mathematics to accept various forms of critique positively.\nMany of the other references which we give also discuss Berkeley's attack on the calculus; see\n[\n5\n]\n,\n[\n11\n]\n,\n[\n19\n]\n,\n[\n21\n]\n,\n[\n26\n]\n,\n[\n30\n]\n, and\n[\n33\n]\n.\nDe Moivre\n,\nTaylor\n,\nMaclaurin\n,\nLagrange\n,\nJacob Bernoulli\nand\nJohann Bernoulli\nall made attempts to bring the rigorous arguments of the Greeks into the calculus.\nMaclaurin\nin\nTreatise on fluxions\ngave the best response to Berkeley.\nBy the late\n1740\ns Berkeley's health was deteriorating. His youngest son William died in\n1751\nwhich added to his decline. Despite this he travelled with his wife to Oxford in July\n1752\nto see his second son George begin his studies at Christ Church. In fact his intention was to remain at Oxford for the rest of his life, which he anticipated would not be very long. He died of a heart attack on the evening of Sunday\n14\nJanuary\n1753\n, sitting with his family listening to his wife reading. He died so peacefully that it is said that the event went unnoticed, the family thinking he had fallen asleep. He left instructions that he was not to be buried for at least five days and he was buried at Christ Church, Oxford on\n20\nJanuary."
