  "biografia": "The viscount\nRobert d'AdhÃ©mar\n, born on the first of November\n1874\nin Saint Hippolyte-du-Fort\n(\nGard, France\n)\n, was descended from one of the oldest noble and protestant families from the region of Provence\n(\nSouth of France\n)\n. His father, Marius d'AdhÃ©mar, worked for the French administration as a collector of taxes\n(\nreceveur de l'enregistrement et des domaines\n)\nand, a few years before his son's birth, fought in the Franco-Prussian War of\n1870\n-\n1871\n. Robert d'AdhÃ©mar's mother was Louise Willelmine Grand d'Esnon. Although Robert was born into a protestant family and brought up as a protestant, he later converted to become a Roman Catholic.\nRobert d'AdhÃ©mar was awarded his baccalaureate in\n1890\nin Montpellier\n(\nHÃ©rault, France\n)\n. He then studied at the LycÃ©e AmpÃ¨re at Lyon, which he entered on\n1\nOctober\n1891\n, preparing for the entrance examination for the Ãcole Centrale des Arts et Manufactures de Paris. He began his studies at the Ãcole Centrale des Arts et Manufactures in\n1893\n, graduating with an engineering degree in\n1896\n. He went on to study mathematics on his own and was, therefore, self-taught in mathematics. In April\n1898\nhe wrote to his friend\nRobert de Montessus de Ballore\ntelling him about the lectures of\nÃmile Picard\nthat he was attending\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nA word in haste to tell you that I will write at length soon to tell you about the course of M\nPicard\nthat I am attending regularly - tomorrow is the\n10\nth\nlesson. We might make a judgement under these conditions, which was hard after\n3\nor\n4\nlessons. The course is wonderful, like his books only easier. In short, one learns properly only with really good books. This is to reassure and encourage you.\nFrom\n1898\nhe began teaching at the Saint FranÃ§ois boarding school in Evreux, about\n90\nkm to the west of Paris, in fact the letter we just quoted from was sent from Evreux. He obtained his Licence es Sciences in\n1899\nfrom the Sorbonne. In\n1902\n, the lectures of\nÃmile Picard\nedited by Robert d'AdhÃ©mar were published under the title\nLeÃ§ons sur les sÃ©ries Ã  termes positifs, professÃ©es au CollÃ¨ge de France\nâ\n(\nLectures on the series with positive terms, given at the College de France\n)\n. He was elected to the\nSociÃ©tÃ© MathÃ©matique de France\non the\n21\nFebruary\n1900\n. His candidature was supported by\nÃmile Picard\nand\nMaurice d'Ocagne\n.\nRobert d'AdhÃ©mar defended his thesis on\n22\nApril\n1904\nbefore a committee consisting of his supervisor\nÃmile Picard\n,\nJacques Hadamard\nand\nÃdouard Goursat\n. The first part of the thesis, entitled\nSur une classe d'Ã©quations aux dÃ©rivÃ©es partielles du second ordre, du type hyperbolique, Ã\n3\nou\n4\nvariables indÃ©pendantes\nâ\n(\nOn a class of hyperbolic partial differential equations of the second order with\n3\nor\n4\nindependent variables\n)\n, dealt with the partial differential equation\n(1)\nwith limit condition that arise in the two problems: the interior problem and the exterior problem.\nIn fact, he improved on a work of\nVito Volterra\non that subject. In the case of the interior problem, Robert d'AdhÃ©mar used his new methods to confirm more quickly the formulas which\nVolterra\nhad obtained. For this problem, he dealt also with the equation\n(2)\n.\nThe thesis was published in\n1905\nin the\nJournal de MathÃ©matiques Pures et AppliquÃ©es\n(5)\n10\n, pp\n131\n-\n207\n. In a lecture to the International Congress of Mathematicians at Heidelberg in August\n1904\n,\nHadamard\nreferred to the ideas in Robert d'AdhÃ©mar's thesis.\nIn\n1901\n, Robert d'AdhÃ©mar became MaÃ®tre de ConfÃ©rences\n(\nessentially equivalent to an assistant lecturer\n)\nat the Lille Catholic University. He was promoted in November\n1904\nto substitute professor, then to full professor in\n1907\n. He taught differential and integral calculus. In\n1902\nhe helped his friend, the mathematician\nRobert de Montessus de Ballore\n, to join the Catholic University of Lille when he proposed him to fill a vacancy as substitute for the Special Mathematics course.\nRobert de Montessus\nwas, at this time, teaching in Senlis and d'AdhÃ©mar wrote to his friend\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nI do not write to you to influence you but I think you must have the courage to leave Senlis, as I had the audacity to leave Evreux. ...\nMoreover, in the same letter, Robert d'AdhÃ©mar explained to his friend that the course of\nJules Drach\nat the University of Lille would be of a great interest for him to prepare for the\nagrÃ©gation\n.\nRobert d'AdhÃ©mar married Jeanne Marie Henriette Duhamel\n(\nborn the\n15\nApril\n1881\nand died the\n20\nAugust\n1965)\non\n5\nFebruary\n1904\nin Merville. Jeanne Marie Henriette Duhamel was the daughter of a manufacturer who owned a castle in Merville in the north of France. Robert d'AdhÃ©mar and his wife lived in Lambersart in the suburbs of Lille.\nRobert d'AdhÃ©mar became an officer in the general staff of the French Army in Italy during World War I. He wrote to\nRobert de Montessus\nfrom the Italian front on\n25\nMay\n1918\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nMy dear friend, I spent one month in Alsace, and I was called urgently to Italy. My training in Alsace was too short ... It was also lovely. I visited all the batteries in an area, and heard the shells whistle, accompanied by a charming man, Gal Jaquet. Here we organize a large ... firing between France and Italy. I deal with the artillery and I have a lot of work under a blazing sun, surrounded by roses. The front has nothing in common with the French front.\nHe left the Lille Catholic University, being given leave during the academic years\n1920\n-\n1921\nand\n1921\n-\n1922\n, then was appointed as professor at the engineering school Institut Industriel du Nord\n(\nnow a day Ãcole Centrale de Lille\n)\nin\n1922\n.\nIt was in\n1901\nthat Robert d'AdhÃ©mar's first publications were published, namely the mathematical papers\nSur une intÃ©gration par approximations successives\nâ\n(\nOn integration by successive approximations\n)\nand\nSur une classe d'Ã©quations aux dÃ©rivÃ©s partielles du second ordre\nâ\n(\nOn a class of partial differential equations of the second order\n)\n. In the same year his\n40\n-page paper on the history of mathematics\nL'oeuvre mathÃ©matique du XIXe siÃ¨cle\nâ\n(\nThe mathematical work of the nineteenth century\n)\nalso appeared. His first book, however, was on the philosophy of science and religion, topics which occupied him in the early part of his career. The Preface to the book\nLa philosophie des sciences et le problÃ¨me religieux\nâ\n(\nPhilosophy of science and the religious problem\n)\n(1904)\nbegins as follows:-\nThe philosophy of science has completely changed its point of view in France in the last ten years of the\n19\nth\ncentury. I would like to show the major importance in this movement of ideas and to perceive what may be their distant consequences.\nHe divides science into three parts, mathematics, physics/chemistry, and biological sciences but, in this book, considers mainly the philosophy of mathematics and physics. The final chapter is on science and religion. He continues this discussion of the ideas in this book in his second book\nLe triple conflit : science, philosophie, religion\n(1905)\n.\nHis next book\nLes variations des thÃ©ories de la science\nâ\n(\nChanges in theories of science\n)\n(1907)\ncontinued to investigate similar subjects. He writes in the Introduction:-\nI do not wish to speak ill of my contemporaries. And yet we must admit that when it comes to religious things, most of them lose their composure. But, addressing them, we say that the Catholic Church is the greatest in the history of religion and the Catholic faith lives in a very large number of intellectually elite men of high morals. ... we will be booed three times, held to be of unsound mind and narrow heart.\nHe goes on to say that religious thought varies both with the times and with the individual thinkers.\nAlthough he had been writing philosophy book, he continued to publish mathematical papers such as\nSur une Ã©quation aux dÃ©rivÃ©es partielles du type hyperbolique\nâ\n(\nOn a partial differential equation of hyperbolic type\n)\n(1905)\nand historical works such as\nTrois maÃ®tres: AmpÃ¨re, Cauchy, Hermite\nâ\n(\nThree masters: Ampere, Cauchy, Hermite\n)\n(1905)\n. His first mathematics book\nLes Ã©quations aux dÃ©rivÃ©es partielles Ã  caractÃ©ristiques rÃ©elles\nâ\n(\nPartial differential equations with real characteristics\n)\nwas published in\n1907\n. This was quickly followed by the books\nExercices et leÃ§ons d'analyse. Quadratures. Ãquations diffÃ©rentielles. Ãquations intÃ©grales de M Fredholm et de M Volterra. Ãquations aux dÃ©rivÃ©es partielles du second ordre\nâ\n(\nExercises and lessons of analysis. Quadratures. differential equations. Fredholm and Volterra integral equations. Partial differential equations of the second order\n)\n(1908)\nand\nL'Ã©quation de Fredholm et les problÃ¨mes de Dirichlet et de Neumann\nâ\n(\nThe Fredholm equation and problems of Dirichlet and Neumann\n)\n(1909)\n.\nIn collaboration with\nRobert de Montessus\n, he wrote the two volume book\nCalcul numÃ©rique\nâ\n(\nNumerical calculation\n)\n(1911)\n. The first volume covered arithmetic and algebraic operations and the second volume studied integration. This book gave numerical methods for solving non-linear equations. Perhaps his most famous book was the two volume\nLecons sur les principes de l'analyse par R d'AdhÃ©mar, professeur a la FacultÃ© Libre des Sciences de Lille\nâ\n(\nLessons on the principles of analysis of R Adhemar, professor at the Free Faculty of Sciences at Lille\n)\n. The first volume\nSÃ©ries.- DÃ©terminants.- IntÃ©grales.- Potentiels. Equations intÃ©grales. Equations diffÃ©rentielles et fonctionnnelles\nâ\n(\nSeries.- Determinants.- Integrals.- potentials. Integral Equations. functional and differential equations\n)\nwas published in\n1912\nwith the second volume\nFonctions synectiques, mÃ©thodes des majorantes. Equations aux derivÃ©es partielles du premier ordre. Fonctions entiÃ¨res\nâ\n(\nSynectic functions, the method of majorant. Partial differential equations of the first order. Entire functions\n)\nbeing published in the following year.\nHis later books were:\nHenri PoincarÃ©\n(1914)\n;\nRÃ©sistance des matÃ©riaux\nâ\n(\nResistance of materials\n)\n(1921)\n; and\nStatique cinÃ©matique\nâ\n(\nStatic kinematics\n)\n(1923)\nwhich was intended as an introduction to mechanics for engineers. He wrote several works on ballistics such as\nLa balistique extÃ©rieure\nâ\n(\nExterior ballistics\n)\n, Gauthier-Villars\n(\nParis,\n1934)\nand\nThÃ©orie du mouvement gyroscopique des projectiles\nâ\n(\nTheory of the gyroscopic movement  of projectiles\n)\n(1939)\n."
