  "biografia": "Hermann Schubert\n's father was an innkeeper. Hermann was brought up in Potsdam where he attended the\nGymnasium\n. However he moved to the Gymnasium in Spandau where he completed his secondary education. He then entered the University of Berlin where he took his first degree in\n1867\n, then moved to the University of Halle where he was awarded a doctorate in\n1870\nfor his thesis on enumerative geometry\nZur Theorie der Charakteristiken\nâ\n(\nOn the theory of characteristics\n)\n. He had published two papers on enumerative geometry before submitting his doctoral dissertation, these being on the system of sixteen spheres that touch four given spheres. This work extended that of\nApollonius\nwho proved that there are eight circles that simultaneously touch three circles in the plane.\nAfter the award of his doctorate, Schubert qualified to become a mathematics teacher and was appointed to the Andreanum Gymnasium in Hildesheim in\n1872\n. While a teacher at this school, Schubert married Anna Hamel in\n1873\n; they had four daughters. He remained as a teacher in the Andreanum Gymnasium for four years before moving to Hamburg when he was appointed to the Johanneum, the renowned humanistic school where\nMÃ¶bius\nhad taught twenty years earlier. In\n1887\nhe was promoted to professor at the Johanneum and he continued to teach at the school but, in\n1905\n, his health began to deteriorate and he started to suffer from circulatory disorders. With his health slowly deteriorating, he retired in\n1908\nat the age of\n60\n. The illness was a long and difficult one which slowly took away the power in his limbs. Near the end of his life he was completely paralysed.\nSchubert is famed for his work on enumerative geometry which considers those parts of\nalgebraic geometry\nthat involves a finite number of solutions. He won the Gold Medal of the\nRoyal Danish Academy of Sciences\n(\nKongelige danske videnkabernes selskab\n)\nin\n1874\nfor solving a question posed by\nZeuthen\non the extension of the theory of characteristics in cubic space curves.\nUsing methods of\nChasles\n, with\nSchrÃ¶der\n's logical calculus as a model, he set up a system to solve such problems, he called it\nthe principal of conservation of the number\n. Burau describes the ideas behind this in\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nAlgebraically, the solution of the problems of enumerative geometry amounts to finding the number of solutions for certain systems of algebraic equations with finitely many solutions. Since the direct algebraic solution of the problems is possible only in the simplest cases, mathematicians sought to transform the system of equations, by continuous variation of the constants involved, into a system for which the number of solutions could be determined more easily.\nPoncelet\ndevised this process, which he called the principle of continuity; in his day, of course, the method could not be elucidated in exact terms. Schubert's achievement was to combine this procedure, which he called \"the principle of conservation of number\", with the\nChasles\ncorrespondence principle, thus establishing the foundation of a calculus. With the aid of this calculus, which he modelled on\nErnst SchrÃ¶der\n's logical calculus, Schubert was able to solve many problems systematically.\nHilbert\n, in his famous Paris lecture of\n1900\n, asked for a proof\n(\nit is Problem\n15)\n, which was given by\nSeveri\nin\n1912\n. Some remarkable counting results of Schubert were neglected for many years for their lack of rigour but recently many of them have been confirmed. In fact it appears that although the principal of conservation of the number as stated by Schubert was false, and counter-examples were given by\nStudy\n, nevertheless Schubert knew exactly what he was doing and his use of the principal was always in cases where it is valid.\nSchubert was editor of\nSammlung Schubert\n, a series of textbooks. He wrote the first in the series\nArithmetik und Algebra\nâ\n(\nArithmetic and algebra\n)\nand a later book in the series on analysis\nNiedere Analysis\nâ\n(\nBasic Analysis\n)\n. He edited a book of tables which contains sixteen numerical tables, including Briggsian and natural logarithms, addition and subtraction logarithms, trigonometric functions and mortality tables.\nGiven Schubert's outstanding mathematical contributions, it is natural to ask why he remained a school teacher and never became a university professor. Certainly it was not through lack of recognition for his contributions. Rather it was because he did not wish to move from Hamburg and turned down a number of offers of university positions. Although Hamburg had no university during the time that Schubert taught in the Andreanum, nevertheless it did have the\nHamburg Mathematical Society\n, founded in\n1690\n, the oldest mathematical society in the world which still exists today.\nIn addition to his research and textbook writing, Schubert was very interested in recreational mathematics and games, in particular chess and skat. He published the first edition of his book on recreational mathematics\nMathematische Mussestunden\nâ\n(\nMathematical recreations\n)\nin\n1897\n. A second edition, by this time expanded to three volumes, appeared in\n1900\nand editions continued to be produced after his death so that the thirteenth edition\n(\nrevised by J Erlebach\n)\nwas published in\n1967\n. In\n1903\nMathematical Essays and Recreations\ntranslated into English by Thomas J McCormack was published. McCormack writes in the Translator's Note:-\nThe essays and recreations constituting this volume are by one of the foremost mathematicians and text-book writers of Germany. The monistic construction of arithmetic, the systematic and organic development of all its consequences from a few thoroughly established principles, is quite foreign to the general run of American and English elementary text-books, and the first three essays of Professor Schubert will, therefore, from a logical and aesthetic side, be full of suggestions for elementary mathematical teachers and students, as well as for non-mathematical readers. For the actual detailed development of the system of arithmetic here sketched, we may refer the reader to Professor Schubert's volume Arithmetik und Algebra ...\nThe remaining essays on \"Magic squares\", \"The fourth dimension\", and \"The history of squaring the circle\", will be found to be the most complete generally accessible accounts in English, and to have, one and all, a distinct educational and ethical lesson.\nIn all these essays, which are of a simple and popular character, and designed for the general public, Professor Schubert has incorporated much of his original research.\nWe should note that\nFrege\nwas highly critical of Schubert's approach to numbers. He wrote\nÃber die Zahlen des Herrn H Schubert\nâ\n(\nOn the numbers of Mr H Schubert\n)\n(1899)\nwhich is a bitter satire with little or no scientific impact although it is very witty in places.\nFrege\n's article is a negative, sarcastic and a very destructive attack on Schubert's article."
