  "biografia": "Regnier Gemma Frisius\nwas a native of Friesland, a coastal province in northern Netherlands, which explains why he gave himself the name of Frisius. He was born Regnier Gemma and only adopted the name Frisius when he later became a scholar for, like many scholars from his country, he adopted a Latin version of his name. So Regnier Gemma became Gemma Frisius. His parents were very poor people and both died when he was still a young child. Left an orphan and a cripple, he was brought up by his stepmother who on a special feast day, when Gemma was six years old, took him to the shrine of St Boniface in Dokkum. Certainly after this his legs which could not support his weight became stronger and his family believed that he had been cured by a miracle. Certainly given the difficult start he had in life it was indeed a miracle that he was able to achieve so much but, however, he remained a frail person all his life.\nGemma attended school in Gröningen then, in\n1526\n, he entered the University of Louvain. Of course his stepmother did not have the means to support him financially through university but he was given a poor student's place in Lily College. He studied for a medical degree but remained at Louvain to study mathematics and astronomy. He went on to become the leading theoretical mathematician in the Low Countries and also to become professor of medicine and mathematics at the University of Louvain. He was also a practicing physician in Louvain.\nGemma Frisius applied his mathematical expertise to geography, astronomy and map making. In Louvain he cooperated with the engraver and goldsmith Gaspard Van der Heyden\n(\nalso known as Gaspar à Myrica\n)\nin the construction of maps, globes and astronomical instruments. His first publication was in\n1529\nwhen he produced a corrected version of\nApianus\n's\nCosmographia\n. The original had been published in\n1524\nand Gemma's new version, which stated on the title page that it was:-\n... carefully corrected and with all errors set to right by Gemma Frisius ...\nwas certainly a completely new printing by the Antwerp publisher Roeland Bollaert. Gemma's edition contained very few changes to the original text, but Gemma had made some alterations to some of the maps, particularly to 'America'. Gemma showed 'America' as two disconnected continents with the one south of the equator being named America while the one to the north of the equator was left without a name.\nIt is reasonable to ask why Gemma Frisius would produce a new edition of\nCosmographia\nwithin five years of the original with relatively few changes.\nCosmographia\nprovided a layman's introduction to such subjects as astronomy, geography, cartography, surveying, navigation and mathematical instruments. The\n1524\nedition published by\nApianus\nhimself was not very popular and Gemma Frisius may have seen the potential to develop it into a more popular work. He may also have seen the potential of producing and selling in his workshop the mathematical instruments described in\nCosmographia\nwhich would then provide an outstanding advertisement for his wares. This was indeed what he went on to do.\nThe next project undertaken by Gemma was to produce a combined terrestrial and celestial globe. The globe was engraved by the goldsmith Gaspar Van der Heyden and by the end of\n1530\nthe globe could be bought from the workshops in Louvain. Gemma published the book\nDe Principiis Astronomiae Cosmographicae\nin the same year which was to supplement the globe. In the dedication of this work he described his terrestrial and celestial globe as\n(\nsee for example\n[\n7\n]\n)\n:-\n... a geographical globe with the most important stars of the eighth celestial sphere.\nThe full Latin title of this work translates to\nOn the Principles of Astronomy and Cosmography, with Instruction for the Use of Globes, and Information on the World and on Islands and Other Places Recently Discovered\n. It was a work in three parts published in Antwerp by Johannes Grapheus\n(\nGemma's original published Roeland Bollaert had died\n)\n. The first part described geographical and astronomical terms such as latitude, longitude, meridian, poles, eclipses, signs of the zodiac etc. The second part described how the globe could be used while the third part vividly described for the reader the peoples, plants etc. in distant lands.\nChapter\n19\nof this work describes, for the first time, how the longitude of a place may be found using a clock to determine the difference in local and absolute times. He says\n(\nsee\n[\n12\n]\n)\n:-\n... it is with the help of these clocks and the following methods that longitude is found. ... observe exactly the time at the place from which we are making our journey. ... When we have completed a journey ... wait until the hand of our clock exactly touches the point of an hour and, at the same moment by means of an\nastrolabe\n... find out the time of the place we now find ourselves. ... In this way I would be able to find the longitude of places, even if I was dragged off unawares across a thousand miles.\nAware of the difficulties of keeping exact time he writes:-\n... it must be a very finely made clock which does not vary with change of air.\nIn a second edition of the work three years later he added some notes about finding the longitude at sea, the first time anyone had attacked the problem. It is worth noting that although there were many methods of finding longitude proposed in the\n250\nyears following Gemma Frisius's work, ultimately the methods he proposed were to become the solution to finding the longitude at sea.\nIn\n1533\nGemma published an enlarged edition of\nCosmographia\nwhich became a great commercial success. He included with this work\nLibellus de locurum\nwhich described the theory of trigonometric surveying and in particular contains the first proposal to use triangulation as a method of accurately locating places. The Polish ambassador in Brussels became aware of the outstanding work being undertaken by Gemma Frisius and invited him to come to meet him at the Imperial court in Brussels. There he tried to persuade Gemma Frisius to go to Poland to collaborate with\nCopernicus\n. It was an interesting proposition which was very tempting but, after some indecision, Gemma decided to turn the offer down and he returned to Louvain.\nIn\n1534\nGemma Frisius published\nTractatus de Annulo Astronomicae\nin which he described an instrument he called the astronomer's ring which he had designed and Van der Heyden had made in his workshop. Gemma states that the astronomer's ring was\n(\nsee for example\n[\n3\n]\n)\n:-\n... not entirely a discovery of mine.\n[\nI have\n]\naugmented the ring so much that from simply showing the hours of the day and the four directions it now rivals whatever mathematical instruments you will.\n[\nMany ideas of others are\n]\nbrought together into this single ring.\nHis work on applying trigonometric methods to astronomical problems led him to note correctly that comets displayed a proper motion against the background stars.\nFrom\n1534\nGemma Frisius began to teach his student\nGerardus Mercator\nand over the following years he cooperated with Gaspard Van der Heyden and\nGerardus Mercator\n. They constructed a terrestrial globe in\n1536\n, and they constructed a celestial globe in the following year. Both globes had been protected by copyright by Charles V with Imperial charters which Gemma and Van der Heyden took out in\n1535\nwhich set out their intention\n[\n7\n]\n:-\n... to publish a globe or sphere of the whole world on which the recently discovered islands and lands will be added, which will be improved and enriched and more beautiful than their earlier globe.\n[\nIt will\n]\nmake mathematics more illustrious ... keep alive the memory of old kingdoms and events and ... make known to coming generations our time and our realm in which ... very many islands and areas unknown in earlier centuries have been discovered ...\n[\nThe celestial globe will be\n]\nfor the general use of enthusiasts.\nA third assistant, whose job it was to do the engraving, was added to the team, this being none other than\nGerardus Mercator\n. When the terrestrial globe appeared it claimed to have been given its form by\n(\nsee for example\n[\n7\n]\n)\n:-\nGemma Frisius, doctor and mathematician, ... from various observations made by geographers.\nAfter completing the terrestrial globe, Gemma's interests turned towards medicine. He was joined by a medical student Andreas Vesalius, who came from Paris to Louvain in the autumn of\n1536\n, and together they found a human corpse outside Louvain. The pair, over several nights, smuggled it into Louvain and reconstructed a skeleton. After a few weeks during which he was totally absorbed in medical matters, Gemma returned to working on his next globe. The celestial globe, which was completed in\n1537\n, was made by\n(\nsee for example\n[\n7\n]\n)\n:-\nGemma Frisius, doctor and mathematician, Gaspard Van der Heyden and Gerard Mercator of Rupelmonde.\nAfter this Gemma went on to produce a world map which is described in\n[\n5\n]\nas 'influential' but sadly no copies have survived; see\n[\n5\n]\nfor further details. In\n1542\nan army swept towards Louvain and the students formed a defence force. Gemma assisted the students, spending four days on the city walls keeping watch for the approach of the attacking forces. After a siege lasting only a few days the students opened fire from the walls of Louvain and, rather surprisingly, the siege was lifted.\nGemma's work on astronomical instruments was described in several of his books. For example in\nDe Radio Astronomico\n(1545)\nhe described his work constructing a cross-staff about\n1\n.\n5\nmetres long with one cross piece about\n3\n/\n4\nof a metre in length. It had brass sighting vanes and a sliding vane. He also invented a new astrolabe which he described in\nDe Astrolabio\nwhich was published in\n1556\n, after his death.\nJohn\nDee\narrived in Louvain in\n1548\nand sought out Gemma Frisius and\nGerardus Mercator\n. He returned to London with mathematical instruments from Louvain as prized possessions. These were:-\n... the first astronomer's staff in brass that was devised by Gemma Frisius; the two great globes of\nGerardus Mercator\n; and the astronomer's ring of brass as Gemma Frisius had newly framed it.\nGemma Frisius made many astronomical observations. In particular he recorded comets in July\n1533\n, January\n1538\nand\n30\nApril\n1539\n. Some of these comet observations are described in works by his son, Cornelius Gemma Frisius, who was born in\n1533\nand went on to become professor of medicine and astronomy at Louvain. Gemma Frisius died of 'stones' at the age of forty-seven.",
