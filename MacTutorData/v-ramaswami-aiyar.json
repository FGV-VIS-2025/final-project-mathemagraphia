  "biografia": "V Ramaswami Aiyar\n's\nname is sometimes given as\nIyer\nand sometimes as\nAiyyar\n. We, however, will refer to him as Ramaswami throughout this biography. His paternal grandfather, S Ramaswami Aiyar, had the degree of B.A. and became a District Collector of Coimbatore. His name appears as the Third Class District Registrar of Coimbatore in\n1890\n. He was said to be noted for his piety and generosity and commanded great respect\n(\nsee\n[\n4\n]\n)\n. Ramaswami Aiyar's father died in\n1872\n, when his young son was only around six months old. Ramaswami Aiyar was bought up by one of his uncles, R Ramachandra Aiyar, who was an Executive Magistrate. His early thirst for knowledge is illustrated in\n[\n4\n]\n:-\nWhen he was four years old, he was missing from the house one day, and after an anxious search, he was traced to a neighbouring pial school, with a broken chip of slate.\nThe pial schools, or tinnai schools, were places where the children were taught to repeat verses without understanding their meaning and pupils learnt little except how to read and write. Naranienger continues\n[\n4\n]\n:-\nThis is how his informal schooling began and shows his thirst for learning at that early age of four. From his school days, his habit of deep concentration was characteristic of him. He was often found pouring over his books, while his companions were engaged in play and amusing themselves. Throughout his scholastic career, he was the 'top boy' in his class and carried away the First Prize, from the First Standard right up to the F.A.\nThe F.A. was the final high school qualification. Ramaswami then began studying at Coimbatore college where he was taught mathematics by R Krishna Aiyar, another of his uncles. Krishna Aiyar had been the first graduate of Coimbatore college in\n1870\nand then became a mathematics lecturer there\n[\n4\n]\n:-\nThe neatness and elegance with which V Ramaswami solved problems set in the class evoked his uncle's admiration.\nRamaswami then studied at Presidency College, Madras, graduating in\n1890\nwith a B.A. Although he wanted to continue his education at this point, because of the poor financial circumstances of his family, he had to accept a poorly paid position as clerk in the Collectorate of the Indian Administrative Service. His talents were recognised by G H Stuart, the Director of Public Instruction in Madras. Stuart had been Fifth Wrangler in the Mathematical tripos at Cambridge in\n1874\nand second Smith's Prizeman. Stuart was able to get a scholarship for Ramaswami to undertake graduate studies at Presidency College, Madras, and the young man was delighted to give up his position as clerk\n[\n4\n]\n:-\nWhile undergoing the graduate course at the Presidency College, his contributions to the Educational Times and other Mathematical journals, which were remarkable for their originality and elegance, attracted the attention of his Professors. The Editor of the Educational Times addressed him as \"Professor Ramaswami\", judging from his contributions that he should be a College Professor. This title of 'Professor' stuck to him ever afterwards.\nIn\n1893\nRamaswami was awarded a Master's Degree and in August\n1894\nhe sat the Mysore Civil Service Examination along with his friend C Hanumantha Rao, also a graduate of Presidency College, Madras. Both failed to be ranked highly enough to gain a place. Soon after he was contacted by the Inspector-General of Education in Mysore, Hormusji J Bhabha, who had M.A. and D.Litt. degrees from England. Bhabha explained to Ramaswami that Venkataswami Nayudu, the Professor of Mathematics at Central College, Bangalore, had taken ill and asked Ramaswami to take over Nayudu's responsibilities while he was on sick leave.\nNow Mandyam Tondanur Naraniengar\n(1871\n-\n1940)\nwas one of Ramaswami's mathematics colleagues at Central College, Bangalore. Naraniengar was interested in geometry and he would later publish many papers, the first three in\n1908\nbeing\nThe intrinsic properties of curves\n, in the\nProceedings\nof the\nEdinburgh Mathematical Society\n, and\nNotes on spherical coordinate geometry\n, and\nThe nine-point circle\n, both by the\nIndian Mathematical Society\n. Ramaswami said in his\n1926\npresidential address\nGenesis and History of Founding of the Society - Mathematical Reminiscences of the founding father himself\nto the\nIndian Mathematical Society\n[\n6\n]\n:-\nM T Naraniengar and I became intimate friends. We were both deeply interested in Mathematics and in a modest way Geometry was our forte and curves our fancy; we discussed nothing but mathematics. Rouse Ball's 'Mathematical Recreations and Essays' had recently come out\n[\nit was published in\n1892]\nand contained a lot to interest us. After Mr Venkataswami Naidu rejoined duty, I continued to remain in Bangalore, meeting Mr M T Naraniengar frequently. We had a special affinity as both of us were old boys of the Cambridge College.\nRamaswami was appointed to Maharaja's College, Mysore, as a Lecturer in Mathematics when mathematics classes leading to a B.A. started there in\n1895\n. His professor was John Weir who was also the Principal of Maharaja's College. Weir had been awarded an M.A. by the University of Glasgow, Scotland, in\n1882\nand, after being an assistant to\nWilliam Jack\nat the University of Glasgow\n(1887\n-\n1890)\n, had moved to India. Weir suggested that Ramaswami should become a member of the\nEdinburgh Mathematical Society\nand arranged for his name to be proposed. Ramaswami became a member of the\nEdinburgh Mathematical Society\nin December\n1895\n. He said\n[\n6\n]\n:-\nThe proceedings of the Society, which I received, gave me my first glimmer of hope that a Mathematical Society like the Edinburgh one could, perhaps, be formed in India.\nHis time at Maharaja's College was, however, short, since he sat the Madras Civil Service Examination in\n1895\nand this time was successful. By the time he joined the\nEdinburgh Mathematical Society\nhe was a Probationary Deputy Collector in Trichinopoly, India. After six years of probation, he became a Deputy Collector in\n1901\n. He remained in that post for the rest of his career, gaining various promotions along the way. For example the Register of the East India Company shows him as a Deputy Collector\n4\nth Grade in\n1915\nand a Deputy Collector\n3\nrd Grade in\n1920\n. After he retired in\n1930\nhe moved to Chittoor, India. His interest in mathematics always seemed to dominate his life\n[\n4\n]\n:-\nThroughout his official life as Deputy Collector, his interest in mathematics never flagged. Stories are there of his absent mindedness while in the midst of trials of Criminal cases, as a magistrate. It appears that he would often be found lost in tackling the solution of a mathematical problem, completely forgetting the case before him, and after a time, as if awaking from a dream, would ask the Pleader to start his arguments afresh. This absent mindedness, or abstraction, was a habit with him even in his domestic life. When at dinner in the company of friends and relatives, he was often discovered lost in thought; he would abruptly get up without finishing his dinner, and would go to the table to note down a solution of a problem which had been engaging his attention all the time.\nRamaswami published his first mathematics paper in\n1897\n, namely\nA general theorem on the nine-points circle\n, which was published in the\nProceedings\nof the\nEdinburgh Mathematical Society\n. In the paper he proved the following theorem:-\nIf any conic be inscribed in a given triangle and a confocal to it pass through the circumcentre, then the circle through the intersection of these two confocals touches the nine-points circle of the triangle.\nIn the same year he published\nExtension of Euclid I.\n47\nto n-Sided Regular Polygons\nin the\nMathematical Gazette\n.\nThese were Ramaswami only mathematical publication until\n1906\nwhen he began publishing a number of articles. For example:\nNote on the Power Inequality\n(1906)\n;\nNote on a point in the demonstration of the Binomial Theorem\n(1906)\n;\nOn the exponential inequalities and the exponential function\n(1907)\n;\nOn the arithmetic and geometric means inequality\n(1907)\n;\nThe A, B, C of the higher analysis\n(1907)\n;\nNote on the circumscribable quadrilateral\n(1908)\n;\nOn Stolz and Gmeiner's Proof of the Sine and Cosine Series\n(1908)\n;\nSome centroid problems\n(1909)\n;\nOn the trisection of an angle by means of a parabola\n(1909)\n;\nTrigonometric inequalities\n(1910)\n;\nOn Steiner's tricusp\n(1911)\n;\nNormals to an ellipse from any given point\n(1911)\n;\nSome metrical relations connected with a pair of isogonal conjugates\n(1911)\n; and\nThe orthopolar theory\n(1912)\n.\nAfter this\n1912\npaper there is a gap of over ten years before he published again, this being\nMiquel Theorems\nin\n1923\n. It is interesting that around\n1906\nhe must have been corresponding with\nG H Hardy\nfor in his paper\nA note on the continuity or discontinuity of a function by an infinite product\n(1908)\nHardy\nwrites:-\nThe question stated above was, if I remember rightly, first suggested to me personally by Prof V Ramaswami Aiyar of Gooty, India, in a letter which I received from him a year of two ago.\nRamaswami is particularly famous for two important things in his mathematical career, namely founding the\nIndian Mathematical Society\nand the 'discovery' of\nRamanujan\n. First let us quote from his\n1926\npresidential address\nGenesis and History of Founding of the Society - Mathematical Reminiscences of the founding father himself\nto the\nIndian Mathematical Society\n. In\n1906\n[\n6\n]\n:-\n... there was a feeling in India that it was the time of large awakening. There was considerable political agitation then, owing to the partition of Bengal. But men also saw that, before India could become great, we needed advancement in many different directions. Our great countryman, Sir J N Tata, had these problems in mind and laid the foundation of a considerable industrial and intellectual advancement. But his great scheme of a Central Research Institute for India made no provision for mathematical advancement. One day I put to myself the question \"Can I not be of some help in advancing the interests of Mathematics in India?\" The spirit of the times made me think seriously about the question. I wanted to form a Mathematical Society which might be something like the\nEdinburgh Mathematical Society\n. I obtained the Calendars of the Madras and the Bombay Universities and made a list of all men who had taken the M.A. degree, or a first class in B.A., or doing work as Professors and Assistant Professors in various colleges. The list was very encouraging. ... On perusal of the long list, it occurred to me that, if by some magic, I could only put all these names into a Society, then with\nEuclid\n, I might say, Q.E.F.\n(\nquod erat faciendum, what is required is now done\n)\n. But I did not see my way for this magic. I was a Deputy Collector and not a Professor of a College who his fellow mathematicians would know. I sometimes thought that, if I were the great Asutosh Mukherji of Bengal, I could make a trumpet call, bringing all the mathematicians together at once. But I was unknown; and any call by me, I felt, would fall flat on the public ear. So, I was in a state of hesitation as to the action I should take.\nIn that year I saw a copy of the 'Quarterly Journal of Mathematics', sent to me by a friend. The matter which it contained was mostly beyond me but there was a little bit that delighted me. And I began to wonder how many such delightful bits, we in India, may be missing by not seeing the leading journals. This made me more eager than ever to try to form a Mathematical Society. At length came the Christmas Day of December\n1906\n. I was put up in the village Chavidi, in Gooty Division, Anantpur District. Thinking calmly, I felt that God will prosper any earnest endeavour made in a selfless cause. I was able to see my plan clearly and I wrote a little letter asking friends to join and form a small Mathematical Society. The letter was simply conceived and had no ambitious programme.\n(\nPublished in vol. XI of the journal of the Society; it is reproduced at\nTHIS LINK\n.\n)\nI sent copies of the letter to one friend after another and I received an abundant response during three months. Then, on the\n4\nth of April\n1907\n, I was able to announce in the Madras dailies that the Society was formed, with a strength of\n20\nmembers, under the name \"The Indian Mathematical Club,\" and I became one of its Joint Secretaries along with Mr Naraniengar and I continued so until\n1910\n.\nA very good choice was made for the headquarters of the new Society, namely Fergusson College, Poona near Bombay. This made the Society seem to be India wide and this was also chosen since in the early days the Society mainly circulated books and journals among it members and Bombay was the postal centre for India. The Principal of Fergusson College agreed to act as the librarian for the Society\n[\n3\n]\n:-\nPoona itself was an auspicious choice - as the Society acknowledged in honouring the efforts of Ramaswami Aiyar in founding the Society: 'It may not be out of place to mention that with the true scholar's freedom from provincial bias, you, a Madrasi, arranged to locate the Headquarters of the Society at Poona, in the Bombay Presidency - a step which gave our Society the unique position of being an All-India.\nRamaswami served as President of the\nIndian Mathematical Society\nin\n1926\n-\n30\n.\nLet us now look at Ramaswami's role in the discovery of\nSrinivasa Ramanujan\nwhich is described in\n[\n4\n]\n:-\nWhen Ramaswami Aiyar was Deputy Collector in Tirtukkoilur in\n1910\n,\nRamanujan\nsought his patronage and asked to be appointed as a clerk in his office.\nRamanujan\n's only recommendation was his 'Ponderous' Note-book, which has now become famous and is preserved in the Madras University Library. It was little known at that time that the notebook contained anything of value. On pursuing the contents of the Note-Book, Ramaswami Aiyar was struck by the extraordinary results recorded therein, and declining to smother his genius by an appointment in his department, recommended him to his mathematical friends in Madras holding high positions. The story is well-known how eventually\nRamanujan\nwas made a Research Student of the Madras University, was deputed to the Cambridge University and achieved distinction as the Greatest Indian Mathematician.\nIn\n[\n6\n]\nRamaswami explained that\nRamanujan\nstayed with him for three days, giving him an opportunity to examine:-\n... those remarkable notebooks in which he had recorded the numerous results of his discoveries. There was little or no explanation given but the results were of a very striking character. I put to him some test questions in order to find out if his methods were really based on sound principles. ...\n[\nRamanujan\n]\nsaid he was badly in need of employment and suggested that I might put him as a teacher in one of the elementary Schools belonging to the Taluk Board of which I was President. I told\nRamanujan\nthat it would be sacrilege on his talents to put him to teach in an Elementary Board School but that I had been thinking out if I could not be of help to him in a real manner.\nThe last events of Ramaswami's life are described in\n[\n4\n]\n:-\nHe attended all the Conferences of the\nIndian Mathematical Society\nexcept one, and actively participated in their deliberations. His last trip to Delhi, in spite of the advice of friends to the contrary, in connection with the Conference held there, proved too tiring for him perhaps. Though he was seemingly all right, he took ill all of a sudden on the\n20\nth January\n1936\n. Cerebral haemorrhage followed and he expired on the\n22\nnd January\n1936\nat\n3\n.\n30\npm, in spite of the best medical treatment, at Chittoor.\nWe give a version of Ranganathan's Obituary of V Ramaswami Aiyar at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nRamaswami himself gave autobiographical information in his\n1926\npresidential address\nGenesis and History of Founding of the Society - Mathematical Reminiscences of the founding father himself\nto the\nIndian Mathematical Society\nwhich we have quoted from above; for a fuller version see\nTHIS LINK\n.",
