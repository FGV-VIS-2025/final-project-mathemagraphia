  "biografia": "Eleanor Pairman\nwas born in Lasswade, which is about six miles south-east of the centre of the city of Edinburgh. Broomieknowe is an area of Lasswade. Her parents were John Pairman, a solicitor at the Supreme Courts of Scotland, and Helen Dunlop. Eleanor, called Nora by her family, was the youngest of her parents' four children, having three older sisters, Maxwell, Margaret and Adeline. John Pairman died before Eleanor was five years old. She began her schooling at Lasswade Higher Grade School in\n1903\n, remaining there for five years. Then in\n1908\nshe entered George Watson's Ladies' College in Edinburgh. Her performance at the school was outstanding and, in\n1912\n, she won a George Watson School Bursary entitling her to free education for session\n1912\n-\n13\nand an allowance of £\n10\n.\nPairman sat the Scottish Leaving Certificate examinations passing Lower Dynamics and Lower Science, with Higher passes in English, French, Latin, Mathematics, and Analytical Geometry. In July\n1914\nshe became dux of George Watson's Ladies College. She also won the George Watson Higher Bursary of £\n80\nand the Special Prize for Mathematics. She matriculated at the University of Edinburgh, beginning her studies in session\n1914\n-\n15\nafter winning a John Welsh Mathematical Bursary.\nIn her first year at Edinburgh University she studied Mathematics, Natural Philosophy, Chemistry, and Logic. The First Year Chemistry Course was taught by James Walker, and Pairman did well, but not brilliantly, being ranked Second Class. Similarly in the Laboratory Chemistry course taught by Leonard Dobbin she was ranked Second Class. However, her performance in mathematics was outstanding. In July\n1915\nshe was awarded the Newton Bursary in Mathematics\n(\nplaced equal with Samuel Allen\n)\n. In the Second Ordinary Class in mathematics, taught by\nLester R Ford\n, she was placed second to Samuel Allen and was awarded a class medal. She continued her studies taking honours in Mathematics and Natural Philosophy and was awarded an M.A. with First Class Honours in July\n1917\n. She was also awarded a Vans Dunlop Scholarship in Mathematics which was a three year scholarship to study at the university of her choice. Supported by the scholarship, Pairman spent the academic year\n1917\n-\n18\nundertaking graduate studies at the University of Edinburgh. She hoped to continue graduate studies at Radcliffe College, a women's college associated with Harvard University, in Massachusetts and\nCargill Knott\nwrote to the dean at Radcliffe:-\nThroughout her career as an undergraduate Miss Pairman's exceptional mathematical abilities were in strong evidence. Although her natural inclinations were towards Pure Mathematics, she easily mastered the Principles and Methods of Applied Mathematics, and gained the Medal in both my Honours Classes in Dynamics and Hydrodynamics, and this among a group of students of marked ability. Miss Pairman also attended a short course I give on Hamiltonian\nQuaternions\nwith Physical Applications, and there I was impressed with her capacity for appreciating the theoretical foundations of the calculus. Very rarely indeed have we had the good fortune of teaching a student with such a strong predilection for mathematical study as Miss Pairman undoubtedly possesses. With fitting opportunity she has every promise of a distinguished and useful career.\nLeaving Edinburgh, Pairman went to London where she worked for a year for\nKarl Pearson\nin the Department of Applied Statistics at University College London as a computer\n(\nat this time computers were people and not machines!\n)\n. It was a highly productive year for not only did she produce a substantial joint publication with\nKarl Pearson\nOn corrections for the moment-coefficients of limited range frequency distributions when there are finite or infinite ordinates and any slopes at the terminals of the range\nwhich appeared in\nBiometrika\n(\nNovember\n1919)\n, but she also wrote\nTracts for Computers\nwhich was published by\nCambridge University Press\n(1\nJanuary\n1920)\n.\nFrom London, Pairman went to the United States to undertake research at Radcliffe College arriving in New York on\n12\nOctober\n1919\n. Her thesis advisor was\nGeorge Birkhoff\nand after submitting her thesis\nExpansion Theorems for Solution of a Fredholm's Linear Homogeneous Integral Equation of the Second Kind with Kernel of Special Non-Symmetric Type\nshe was awarded a Ph.D. in\n1922\n.\nPairman joined the\nEdinburgh Mathematical Society\nin January\n1917\n, and read the paper\nOn a difference equation due to Stirling\nto the meeting of the Society on\n11\nJanuary\n1918\n, and the paper\nA new form of the remainder in Newton's interpolation formula\nto the next meeting of the Society on\n8\nFebruary. After about five years she informed the Society that her name was now Mrs Eleanor Pairman Brown. She remained a member for around\n16\nyears. In fact Pairman had met Bancroft Huntington Brown when both were graduate students and they had both been awarded a Ph.D. in mathematics in June\n1922\n. The two then went to Scotland where they were married in Broomieknowe on\n10\nAugust\n1922\n. They returned to the United States, moving to Hanover, New Hampshire where Bancroft Brown had a position at Dartmouth College. The College was founded in\n1769\nas a men's College with an all male teaching staff and when Bancroft Brown was appointed this was still the case so there was no possibility that Eleanor could teach at the College. He remained at the College throughout his whole career.\nEleanor and Bancroft Brown had four children, a son John Pairman born in\n1923\n, a daughter Barbara in\n1925\n, a second daughter Joanna in\n1935\nwho died as an infant, and a third daughter Margaret Wylde in\n1937\n. In\n1927\nshe published a joint mathematics paper\nOn a class of integral equations with discontinuous kernels\nwith Rudolph E Langer, who was a friend who graduated from Harvard in a June\n1922\nceremony as Eleanor Pairman and Bancroft Brown and, like Eleanor, had\nGeorge Birkhoff\nas his thesis advisor. Langer taught at Dartmouth College during\n1922\n-\n25\n. However, Eleanor Brown later undertook task to help students who were blind. The authors of\n[\n3\n]\nwrite:-\nEleanor Brown began to learn Braille in about\n1950\nand later learned the Nemeth Code for mathematical notation. She made transcriptions using household items and her sewing machine to create geometric diagrams and mathematical symbols. Examples of her work included a freshman mathematics text and a reference book on group theory.\nHer daughter Margaret explained:-\nGeometry was a particular problem, because you really need diagrams. Braille is done on paper like thin cardstock. So she rounded up all kinds of household implements like pinking shears and pastry wheels and such and created diagrams that could be felt with the fingers, like the Braille symbols. Apparently nobody had ever done this before.\nEleanor Brown's son-in-law Thomas Streeter wrote:-\nA graduate student at Harvard was blind and needed a particular book put into Braille, and it was full of mathematical symbols. What to do? The sewing machine, of course. She had written down the math and had it beside the machine. She put a piece of Braille paper under the foot and proceeded to reproduce the symbols by guiding the paper under the needle. It had to be the mirror image of what she had written.\nAlthough she had not been employed as a mathematician after being awarded her doctorate, Eleanor Brown did take up an appointment as a part-time Instructor in Mathematics at Dartmouth College in September\n1955\nand taught there for the next four academic years. At this time her husband was B P Cheney professor at Dartmouth.\nJohn Kemeny\n, who was appointed to the Mathematics Department at Dartmouth in\n1953\n, became chairman of the Department at the same time that Eleanor Brown began her teaching post at the College. Her daughter Margaret wrote:-\nFor all the satisfaction that she got from these\n[\nBraille\n]\nprojects, the only time I saw her truly happy was when she was teaching. And she had precious little opportunity to do that, being obviously ahead of her time and also stuck in a males-only college community and in a world where it was well-nigh impossible for married ladies to function professionally.\nShe died after a long battle with breast cancer in a nursing home in White River Junction; her husband died one year later.\nFinally let us comment on the careers of Eleanor Brown's three children. Her son John Pairman Brown studied mathematics and classics at Dartmouth College and then went to Union Theological Seminary in New York City where he obtained a doctorate. Eleanor Brown's eldest daughter Barbara was awarded a doctorate in languages and literature from Rutgers University and became a university lecturer of English. Eleanor Brown's youngest daughter Margaret graduated from Brown University and became a medical editor.",
