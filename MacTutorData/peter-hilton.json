  "summary": "Peter Hilton was an English mathematician who made important contributions to homotopy theory. He is best known for his text-books and for his work as a code-breaker in World War II.",
  "biografia": "Peter Hilton\n's parents were Elizabeth Freedman and Mortimer Hilton. Peter was born and brought up in London, England. His interest in mathematics was reinforced in a strange way in\n1933\n[\n9\n]\n:-\nAt the age of\n10\n, I was run over by a Rolls Royce, no less. It was an extraordinary incident. A boy in school snatched the cap off my head and ran across the road. I was angry and ran after him. I didn't notice the on-coming Rolls Royce. ... what happened was that I had a long period of recuperation, much of which was spent in a hospital bed with plaster of Paris on my left leg, all the way up, in fact, to my navel. So I had this sort of white board permanently available to me sitting on my stomach. It simply turned out that I spent a lot of my leisure time doing mathematical problems, writing them on the plaster of Paris, and erasing them each morning. It gave me the opportunity to realize that I had this intensive love of mathematics. I realized earlier that I had a certain proficiency, but I hadn't realized before that it was the sort of thing I would do when I had the choice of doing other things. So then it came to me that I really loved mathematics and thoroughly enjoyed doing it. I recall even having unkind thoughts about visitors who came to see if I was all right, as they would interrupt me when I was really enjoying what I was doing.\nHe attended St Paul's School, Hammersmith, London, completing his studies in\n1940\n. In his final year at the school he studied German on his own, a decision which soon had an unexpected significance. He won a scholarship to The Queen's College, Oxford, in his final year at school and matriculated in\n1940\n. He was only just beginning his second year of study in November\n1941\nwhen an interviewing board arrived in Oxford looking to recruit \"a mathematician with knowledge of modern European languages\"\n[\n5\n]\n:-\nMy tutor recommended me to attend the interview although I was not a mathematician - merely an undergraduate of mathematics - and my knowledge of German was rudimentary, since I had merely been teaching myself for a year.\nHilton was offered a position in the Foreign Office and told he had to start in January\n1942\n. Since he was not due to be conscripted into the Royal Artillery for war service until August\n1942\n, he was a little reluctant to give up his university studies earlier than necessary. However he had already undergone compulsory military training in the Royal Artillery which he had found extremely boring so it did not take him long to decide to start work at Bletchley Park on\n12\nJanuary\n1942\n. Although he had only completed four terms at Oxford, this entitled him to a wartime B.A. Only when he arrived at Bletchley Park did he learn the nature of the decoding work which he was to undertake. Hilton made a substantial contribution to the vitally important work which was undertaken at Bletchley Park, but the most significant aspect as far as his future career was concerned was the mathematicians he came to know through working there\n[\n9\n]\n:-\n... two of my colleagues\n[\nat Bletchley Park\n]\nwere\nHenry Whitehead\nand\nMax Newman\n. Due to the peculiar circumstances of the war, I was on an equal footing with them. In fact, I was simply a young man who had taken a wartime degree and they were eminent mathematicians. I became, in particular, very, very friendly with\nHenry Whitehead\n, on first-name, beer-drinking terms. After the war,\nHenry Whitehead\ninvited me to come back to Oxford and be his first post-war research student. I said, \"But I don't know anything about topology.\" And he said, \"Oh, don't worry, Peter, you'll like it.\" So in fact, I didn't even know what the subject was. I went back to Oxford, and I studied topology. Whatever\nHenry Whitehead\nhad specialized in, I would have studied. His personality was so attractive, that it was clear that it was going to be great fun to work with him. It turned out to be not only fun but extremely exacting and demanding - it was a marvellous experience. I really took up topology because it was\nWhitehead\n's field.\nHilton was awarded an M.A. by Oxford in\n1948\nand, two years later, a doctorate for his thesis\nCalculation of the Homotopy Groups of\nA\nn\n2\nA_{n}^{2}\nA\nn\n2\n​\n-polyhedra\n. He published the main results of his thesis in two papers in the\nQuarterly Journal of Mathematics\n, the first appearing in\n1950\nand the second in the following year. We will not give the technical definition of an\nA\nn\n2\nA_{n}^{2}\nA\nn\n2\n​\n-polyhedron, let us just say that it is a certain type of finite connected polytope. The main tool used in this work is a \"suspension\" theorem of\nHenry Whitehead\nwhich Hilton also generalised and applied in his major\n31\n-page paper\nSuspension theorems and the generalized Hopf invariant\n(1951)\n. During this period Hilton was employed as a Lecturer at the University of Manchester\n(1948\n-\n1952)\n. He wrote to\nMax Newman\n28\nMarch\n1949\n:-\nTo supplement my income next year, in the hope, eventually, of being able to put down the deposit for a house, I have offered to give a course of extra-mural lectures on \"The Development of Mathematics\". Messrs Styler and Pedley seemed interested and asked me to give a syllabus, which I based on the course I gave in Oxford in\n1947\n-\n48\n. They want me to give an extension course\n(\nonce a week\n)\nstarting in October, but I thought before agreeing I should make sure that you have no objections. I think I can promise that neither the preparation time nor the lecturing time would eat into my research time!\nThe reason he was keen to buy a house was that he was soon to marry. He married Margaret Mostyn on\n14\nSeptember\n1949\n; they had two sons Nicholas and Timothy. Peter and Margaret\n(\nMeg\n)\nshared a love of the theatre and of acting; Peter enjoyed amateur acting, Meg was a professional. He spent the three years\n1952\n-\n55\nat Cambridge, receiving a second doctorate from Cambridge in\n1952\n. Then he returned to Manchester where he was promoted to Senior Lecturer in\n1956\n.\nThis part of Hilton's career was, like his doctoral studies, highly influenced by the friends he had made among the mathematicians at Bletchley. When Hilton first arrived at Bletchley Park he had worked in Hut\n8\nwhere\nHugh Alexander\nand\nShaun Wylie\nintroduced him to the cryptanalysis methods used in decoding Naval Enigma messages. Later both Hilton and\nWylie\nmoved to the Newmanry run by\nMax Newman\n, where early computers\n(\nthe Colossus machines\n)\nwere used in decoding, and Hilton and\nWylie\nremained close friends. When Hilton was appointed to the University of Manchester in\n1948\nit was to work in\nMax Newman\n's Department. When he went to Cambridge University in\n1952\nhe became a colleague of his friend\nShaun Wylie\n. Together they wrote the classic textbook\nHomology theory: An introduction to algebraic topology\npublished in\n1960\n. A Heller writes in a review:-\nThis admirable book is designed to make the transition between the elementary textbook and the research-level treatise in\nalgebraic topology\n. It begins with concrete geometrical fundamentals and manages nevertheless to introduce its reader to enough of the heavyweight machinery of modern topology so that he may hope to attack the contemporary literature of the field. The plan of the book is bipartite. The first portion is concerned principally with the homology theory of simplicial polyhedra, the second with singular homology. ...\n[\nAn\n]\naccount of the contents does not convey the richness of the discussion and the plenitude of examples which indeed are calculated not only to illuminate the systematic discussion but also to introduce the reader to the atmosphere of algebraic topology. This aim is even more evident in the very extensive collection of problems, which range from straightforward exercises to items out of the recent literature ... This is a badly needed book. It does an excellent job of carrying the serious beginning student of algebraic topology to a genuine acquaintance with the field, and seems to this reviewer likely to become a standard work in a domain where indeed it is essentially without a rival.\nHowever, this was not the first book that Hilton had published. He wrote\nAn introduction to homotopy theory\nwhich was published in\n1953\n. He wrote in the Preface:-\nAt the moment, no textbook of homotopy theory exists at any level, with the result that the newcomer to this branch of mathematics is obliged to plunge straight into the study of original papers, often of very considerable complexity. This monograph is designed to fill the gap. It does not claim to be a comprehensive treatment of its subject\n(\nthe recent work of the French school, for example, is not included, except for a brief introduction to it in the last section of Chapter V\n)\n; but it is hoped that the reader familiar with\nLefschetz\n's 'Introduction to Topology' will obtain an understanding of the fundamental ideas of homotopy theory from the first six chapters of this book.\nShaun Wylie\nwrites in a review\n[\n10\n]\n:-\nThis book occupies an important place in the literature of topology. ... It is a book for the serious student. For such a person, it is excellent, both in the clarity and discipline of the presentation and for the range of results covered.\nHilton had also published\nDifferential calculus\n, a\n56\n-page text in the\nLibrary of Mathematics\nseries. Hilton explain his aim in the Introduction:-\nThis book is intended to provide the university student in the physical sciences with information about the differential calculus which he is likely to need ... The emphasis is on detailed discussion of the ideas ... rather than on complete proofs.\nBy the time that\nHomology theory: An introduction to algebraic topology\nwas published, Hilton was Mason Professor of Pure Mathematics at Birmingham University. He had been appointed to this Chair in\n1958\nand remained at Birmingham for four years. He spoke in\n[\n9\n]\nof his decision to move to the United States in\n1962\n:-\nI had been appointed head of department at Birmingham University in\n1958\n, and it looked as if I would be there for the rest of my career. That is to say that I would have approximately another\n35\nyears as head of department. ... I was doing a lot of committee work. I was very conscientious and I don't believe unusually proficient, and I realized that it was having a very deleterious effect on my research. I saw no escape, because I certainly wasn't a big enough person to downgrade myself again, say to the rank of senior lecturer, to halve my salary and lose my position. And yet on the other hand I could not see the possibility of my aspiring to one of the very few positions in the country, at that time, where you could have professorial status without departmental and university-wide responsibilities. ... I had visited Cornell and thoroughly enjoyed it. When an offer came from Cornell, my wife Meg and I talked it over seriously. Then we realized that this was really the unique way of escaping from the situation. So we decided to try it experimentally, and it worked very well.\nDuring the\n1950\ns Hilton had been an invited speaker at the British Mathematical Colloquium on three occasions\n(\nhe is the only person to have had three invitations in a\n10\nyear period\n)\n. He gave the lectures:\nThe Hilbert problem for three dimensional groups\nat Oxford in\n1950\n,\nFibre spaces\nat Exeter in\n1955\n, and\nLusternic-Schnitelmann category in homotopy theory\nat Cardiff in\n1959\n.\nHilton was appointed Professor at Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, in\n1962\n, remaining there for nine years. Then, in\n1971\nhe moved to the University of Washington. After two years there, he was appointed Louis D Beaumont Professor at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio. In the interview\n[\n9\n]\n, when asked if there is anything he wished he had done differently, Hilton replied:-\nI would not have accepted the position at Case Western Reserve University.\nAfter holding this position for nine years, Hilton became Distinguished Professor at the State University of New York\n(\nSUNY\n)\n, Binghamton. The title Distinguished Professor, granted only by SUNY trustees, is highest academic rank only conferred on those who have achieved national or international prominence. He remained at SUNY until he retired in\n1993\nwhen the university conferred on him the title Professor Emeritus. Also in\n1993\nhe became Distinguished Professor at the University of Central Florida in Orlando.\nHilton has made a remarkable contribution both as a research mathematician and as an author of textbooks. In November\n2009\n, MathSciNet records an incredible\n338\npublications under his name. Let us indicate his research contribution by quoting his own words\n[\n9\n]\n:-\nI think I have made more of a contribution as an expositor in algebraic topology than as a researcher, in bringing ideas into good order so that they would be accessible to students of algebraic topology and homological algebra. In my own research I think the best paper I ever wrote is a paper I wrote under the influence of\nJean-Pierre Serre\non the homotopy groups of the union of spheres\n[\nOn the homotopy groups of the union of spheres\n(1955)]\n. This was, I think, the first time that\nLie algebras\nwere used in homotopy theory in an effective way. It was basic and it is a paper very frequently cited. I think then I would have to jump and say that a series of papers I did with Joseph Roitberg and later also with Guido Mislin on questions relating to failures of cancellation in homotopy theory are good papers. There are two sorts of cancellation you can ask about in homotopy theory. You can take the union of two spaces with a single common point - it's like addition - so you're asking about failure of cancellation under addition. We were able to show systematically how to construct examples where one could take two different spaces, and add on the same space to each, so that the two unions had the same homotopy type; and then, what turned out to be a more difficult problem, we showed how to construct examples with the topological product replacing the union. In the course of that work Joe Roitberg and I were able to construct the first new example of a\nHopf\nmanifold. And that, I think, began a whole new industry in mathematics. So I was very happy about that paper. Then I would say the work that the three of us did on localization theory - the new results and the systematization of known results - was a very significant contribution to the whole structure of the subject. I think also that\nEckmann\nand I did significant work in applying categorical notions. Both of us felt these notions were appropriate for looking at concepts and problems in algebraic topology and homological algebra. We were neither of us pure category- theorists and I think that these series of papers we wrote on group-like structures in general categories, and on general homotopy theory and duality, were two very significant contributions to the applications of these categorical notions that suggested ideas and problems. I always feel enormously grateful to\nNorman Steenrod\n, that he not only encouraged us, but also when he compiled his list of papers in algebraic topology, he gave\nEckmann\n-Hilton duality a special heading for the papers that had been written in that area. I do think that\nEckmann\nand I did in that way systematize some ideas and we showed how certain ideas are naturally related. Some of these things were intuitively clear to certain people but had not been systematized. By systematizing them, we made them more readily accessible to students, but also we broadened and extended them substantially.\nHilton has written many outstanding books - from first year undergraduate level, to graduate text level, to research monograph. We cannot do justice to them in this biography but let us at least mention most of them. Following on from those already mentioned,\nPartial derivatives\n(1960)\n\"is intended primarily to serve the needs of the university student in the physical sciences\". Then there are three texts\nHomotopy theory and duality\n(1965)\n;\nSuites spectrales et théories de cohomologie générales\n(1970)\n; and\nTópicos de álgebra homológica\n(1970)\neach based on courses given by Hilton. Also in\n1970\n, in collaboration with\nBrian Griffiths\n, he published\nA comprehensive textbook of classical mathematics\n. This book, reprinted in\n1978\n, is a classic. Keith Hirst, reviewing the book, writes:-\nThis book is written by two men who have each contributed much to the development of mathematical education in universities, as well as to mathematics itself. Both of these activities have aided in the writing of the book, whose starting point was an in-service course of mathematics for teachers at Birmingham University in\n1961\n-\n62\n. There is a long introduction, which should be read with care, for it reveals as few other textbooks the existence of opinions about the presentation of mathematical ideas, their communication, and their importance. This leads to a personal commitment to sharing mathematics which pervades the whole body of the book.\nFor further details of this book see the biography of\nBrian Griffiths\n.\nContinuing in our run through of some of Hilton's books, there is:\nGeneral cohomology theory and K-theory\n(1971)\n;\nLectures in homological algebra\n(1971)\n;\n(\nwith Urs Stammbach\n)\nA course in homological algebra\n(1971)\n;\n(\nwith Yel Chiang Wu\n)\nA course in modern algebra\n(1974)\n;\n(\nwith Joe Roitberg and Guido Mislin\n)\nLocalization of nilpotent groups and spaces\n(1975)\n;\nNilpotente Gruppen und nilpotente Räum\n(1984)\n;\n(\nwith Dereck Holton and Jean Pedersen\n)\nMathematical reflections : In a room with many mirrors\n(1997)\n; and\n(\nwith Dereck Holton and Jean Pedersen\n)\nMathematical vistas : In a room with many mirrors\n(2002)\n. Of these last two books, the first \"is suitable for keen high school and college students and would serve as an admirable text for teacher-training.\" The second of the two is a companion book in which the authors write:-\nThe two books are dedicated to the same principal purpose - to stimulate the interest of bright people in mathematics.\nFinally let us give the following quote from a review that Hilton wrote in\n1998\n[\n4\n]\n:-\nJust as any sensitive human being can be brought to appreciate beauty in art, music or literature, so that person can be educated to recognize the beauty in a piece of mathematics. The rarity of that recognition is not due to the \"fact\" that most people are not mathematically gifted but to the crassly utilitarian manner of teaching mathematics and of deciding syllabi and curricula, in which tedious, routine calculations, learned as a skill, are emphasized at the expense of genuinely mathematical ideas, and in which students spend almost all their time answering someone else's questions rather than asking their own.",
