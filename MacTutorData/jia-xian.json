  "biografia": "Jia Xian\nis also known as\nChia Hsien.\nAlmost nothing is known about his life. It is recorded that he was a pupil of Chu Yan who was a famous calendarist, astronomer and mathematician. We know that Chu Yan was productive over the years\n1022\nto\n1054\nso he must have tutored Jia Xian at some time between these years. Other evidence would suggest that Chu Yan taught Jia Xian fairly near the beginning of his career.\nAccording to Qian\n[\n3\n]\n, Jia Xian was a Palace Eunuch of the Left Duty Group. This requires a little explanation. The Emperor of China would employ eunuchs, castrated men, as guards and servants in his Palace. Although the original role was that of guarding the women's quarters, these men achieved real power and influence. In addition to their role as guards they became confidential advisers to the Emperor, and sometimes government ministers.\nJia Xian is known to have written two mathematics books:\nHuangdi Jiuzhang Suanjing Xicao\n(\nThe Yellow Emperor's detailed solutions to the\nNine Chapters on the Mathematical Art\n)\n, and\nSuanfa Xuegu Ji\n(\nA collection of ancient mathematical rules\n)\n. Both are lost and we know nothing of the second of the two books other than its title. The first, however, although it has been lost is known to us in some detail. This is because\nYang Hui\nwrote\nXiangjie Jiuzhang Suanfa\n(\nA detailed analysis of the mathematical rules in the\nNine Chapters\n)\nin\n1261\nwith the intention of explaining, and making better known, the work of Jia Xian. A copy of\nYang Hui\n's text has survived and he explicitly states his reasons for writing the work in the preface.\nWhat does\nYang Hui\ntell us of Jia Xian's mathematical contribution? The first is an understanding of\nPascal's triangle\n. Here Jia Xian is aware of the expansion of\n(\na\n+\nb\n)\nn\n(a + b)^{n}\n(\na\n+\nb\n)\nn\nand gives a table of the resulting binomial coefficients in the form of\nPascal's triangle\n. Jia Xian appears to have calculated the binomial coefficients up to\nn\n=\n6\nn = 6\nn\n=\n6\nand gave an accompanying table similar to\nPascal\n's triangle which records the coefficients up to the row\n1\n6\n15\n20\n15\n6\n1\nIt is clear from\nYang Hui\n's description that Jia Xian understood the method of generating the triangle, namely adding the numbers in the two positions above in order to find the number in the position below.\nThe other contribution is an algorithm for root extraction but, as we shall see below, it uses the\nPascal\ntriangle method. He generalised a method of finding square roots and cube roots to finding nth roots, for\nn\n>\n3\nn > 3\nn\n>\n3\n, and then extended the method to solving polynomial equations of arbitrary degree. The algorithm is called the\nZeng chang kaifang\nmethod by Jia Xian, which means the additive-multiplicative method for root extractions. The method is essentially that which today is called the\nRuffini\n-\nHorner\nmethod or\nHorner\n's method.\nLet us illustrate the method by solving\nx\n3\n=\n146363183\nx^{3} = 146363183\nx\n3\n=\n1\n4\n6\n3\n6\n3\n1\n8\n3\nSince\n1\n0\n6\n<\nx\n3\n<\n1\n0\n9\n10^{6} < x^{3} < 10^{9}\n1\n0\n6\n<\nx\n3\n<\n1\n0\n9\nwe see that\n100\n<\nx\n<\n1000\n100 < x < 1000\n1\n0\n0\n<\nx\n<\n1\n0\n0\n0\n. Put\nx\n=\n100\na\n+\n10\nb\n+\nc\nx = 100a + 10b + c\nx\n=\n1\n0\n0\na\n+\n1\n0\nb\n+\nc\nwhere\na\na\na\nis between\n1\nand\n9\nand\nb\n,\nc\nb, c\nb\n,\nc\nare between\n0\nand\n9\n. Since\n50\n0\n3\n=\n125000000\n500^{3} = 125000000\n5\n0\n0\n3\n=\n1\n2\n5\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\nand\n60\n0\n3\n=\n216000000\n600^{3} = 216000000\n6\n0\n0\n3\n=\n2\n1\n6\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\nwe see that\na\n=\n5\na = 5\na\n=\n5\n. Now consider\n(\n500\n+\n10\nb\n)\n3\n=\n125000000\n+\n7500000\nb\n+\n150000\nb\n2\n+\n1000\nb\n3\n≤\n146363183\n(500 + 10b)^{3} = 125000000 + 7500000b + 150000b^{2}+ 1000b^{3}≤ 146363183\n(\n5\n0\n0\n+\n1\n0\nb\n)\n3\n=\n1\n2\n5\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n+\n7\n5\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\nb\n+\n1\n5\n0\n0\n0\n0\nb\n2\n+\n1\n0\n0\n0\nb\n3\n≤\n1\n4\n6\n3\n6\n3\n1\n8\n3\n.\nSubtract\n125000000\nto get\n7500000\nb\n+\n150000\nb\n2\n+\n1000\nb\n3\n≤\n21363183\n7500000b + 150000b^{2} + 1000b^{3} ≤ 21363183\n7\n5\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\nb\n+\n1\n5\n0\n0\n0\n0\nb\n2\n+\n1\n0\n0\n0\nb\n3\n≤\n2\n1\n3\n6\n3\n1\n8\n3\nLooking only at the first term gives\nb\n<\n3\nb < 3\nb\n<\n3\nand\nb\n=\n2\nb = 2\nb\n=\n2\nis easily seen to be the largest possible value giving the left hand side\n15608000\n. Now with\na\n=\n5\na = 5\na\n=\n5\nand\nb\n=\n2\n,\nx\n=\n100\na\n+\n10\nb\n+\nc\nb = 2, x = 100a + 10b + c\nb\n=\n2\n,\nx\n=\n1\n0\n0\na\n+\n1\n0\nb\n+\nc\nhas become\n520\n+\nc\n520 + c\n5\n2\n0\n+\nc\nso\nx\n3\n=\n(\n520\n+\nc\n)\n3\nx^{3} = (520 + c)^{3}\nx\n3\n=\n(\n5\n2\n0\n+\nc\n)\n3\n. Subtract\n15608000\nfrom\n21363183\nto get\n811200\nc\n+\n1560\nc\n2\n+\nc\n3\n=\n5755183\n811200c + 1560c^{2} + c^{3} = 5755183\n8\n1\n1\n2\n0\n0\nc\n+\n1\n5\n6\n0\nc\n2\n+\nc\n3\n=\n5\n7\n5\n5\n1\n8\n3\nwhich is satisfied by\nc\n=\n7\nc = 7\nc\n=\n7\n.\nA fascinating historical account of methods of root extraction used by Chinese and Arabic scholars is given in\n[\n4\n]\n. Chemla defines precisely what constitutes the\nRuffini\n-\nHorner\nmethod so that at each step of the algorithm precisely the same procedure, using multiplication and subtraction, is carried out until the root is obtained. After examining earlier Chinese methods given in the\nNine Chapters on the Mathematical Art\nand those by\nZhang Qiujian\nin the fifth century, she concludes that Jia Xian was the first to use the\nRuffini\n-\nHorner\nmethod. An examination of root extraction methods by Arabic authors leads to the conclusion that\nal-Samawal\nin the twelfth century was the first to use the\nRuffini\n-\nHorner\nmethod. It is also shown in\n[\n4\n]\nthat both Jia Xian's method and\nal-Samawal\n's method end up with the same form for the approximation of nth roots. If\na\na\na\nis the integral portion of the\nn\nn\nn\nth root of\nA\nA\nA\n, then the approximation is given by\na\n+\nA\n−\na\nn\n(\na\n+\n1\n)\nn\n−\na\nn\na + \\Large\\frac{A - a^{n}}{(a + 1)^{n} - a^{n}}\na\n+\n(\na\n+\n1\n)\nn\n−\na\nn\nA\n−\na\nn\n​\n.\nBoth Jia Xian and\nal-Samawal\nuse binomial coefficients, computed with a form of\nPascal\n's triangle, to calculate the denominator of the expression. The intriguing question of whether\nal-Samawal\ndiscovered the method independently, or whether there was transmission of the Chinese method of Jia Xian into Islamic/Arabic mathematics is left unresolved.",
