  "summary": "John McCowan was a Scottish physicist who was a pioneer in the study of fluid mechanics and  wave theory.",
  "biografia": "John McCowan\n's parents were William McCowan, a tailor and clothier, and Mary McKay. His birth was registered at Causewayhead, just north of Stirling, on\n19\nFebruary\n1863\n. William and Mary had been married in Glasgow on\n21\nMarch\n1862\n, and John was their first child. William McCowan's father, also named John McCowan like his grandson, had also been a tailor in Bridge of Allan. He had earned extra income by running a lodging house for visitors who came to Bridge of Allan to take the waters. In a letter written to his sister on\n29\nApril\n1869\n, when his grandson was six years old, John McCowan Senior paints a picture of what Bridge of Allan was like. We quote the letter at length since it gives a feel for the times in the town when the subject of this biography was growing up\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nWe are all well at present. This is a time when a great many strangers are here at the wells. Our houses here are mostly let to Lodgers. I intend to buy a Bridge of Allan paper on Saturday to send to you, in which you will see that there are a great deal of people here at present. This is our busiest time in the year to make up our rents. My wife is very much toiled in cooking for them. You have here the picture of the house where the mineral water is drunk, also of the baths for invalids, a much frequented place. They have always a great many lodgers. They are making a great addition to the bath house this season, and when completed it will be a great building and will contain a great many Lodgers itself, which may be against other peoples houses letting but the place is always increasing. We have new houses getting up every year. It vexes me often to think that I might have had a house of my own when I have it not, but have to pay a heavy rent, but I must not repine. My days here cannot be long now, but I may be thankful that at present I am so well, for a short time ago I was confined to my bed. The rest of my family are just about the same way as when I wrote last.\nJohn McCowan attended the University of Glasgow, taking classes in Latin and Greek in Session\n1879\n-\n80\n. In Session\n1880\n-\n81\nhe took the B.Sc. Chemistry class and the Junior Class of Civil Engineering and Mechanics in which he was placed fifth. In\n1881\nhe was awarded the Malcolm Kerr Bursary in Natural Philosophy by examination, then in the next session,\n1881\n-\n82\n, he was extremely successful being awarded the Certificate in Engineering Sciences. He also passed B.Sc. Natural Philosophy, Civil Engineering and Mechanics, Office and Field Work in Engineering, and M.A. Mathematics and Natural Philosophy in April\n1882\n. He received many awards in Session\n1881\n-\n82\nsuch as the First Prize in Engineering, the First Walker Prize for the Written Examination, and the First George Harvey Prize. He was also First Equal in the Senior Class of Office and Field Work in Engineering, and Second Equal in Laboratory Studies. He graduated with a B.Sc. in\n1883\n, taking courses in mathematics, natural philosophy and geology, but given his outstanding engineering work from the previous session it is a little surprising that he was only awarded a B.Sc. with Second Class Honours in Mathematics and Natural Philosophy. It is worth noting that taking a B.Sc. as a first degree, although the norm today, was unusual in the\n19\nth\ncentury since most Scottish students at this time took an M.A. as a first degree, then those who were so inclined took a B.Sc. as a second degree. In fact references to McCowan in the Minutes of the\nEdinburgh Mathematical Society\nin\n1885\nwrongly put M.A. after his name instead of B.Sc. He had already taken some M.A. courses and in\n1883\nhe was taking further M.A. courses, being the best student in Second Year Mathematics.\nAfter graduating with a B.Sc., McCowan was awarded the Thomson Experimental Scholarship for Session\n1883\n-\n84\n. McCowan was recommended for this Scholarship, founded by\nSir William Thomson\n(\nlater Lord Kelvin\n)\nin\n1869\n, for showing\n[\n3\n]\n:-\n... zeal and ability in experimental investigations in the Physical Laboratory.\nBy the terms of the scholarship, he had to engage in continuous investigation for at least nine months and, from October\n1883\nto June\n1884\n, McCowan reported to\nThomson\non the progress of his work. We give an indication of the content of McCowan's reports to show the experimental research he was undertaking while holding the Scholarship\n(\nsee\n[\n4\n]\n)\n:\n15\nOctober\n1883\n- comments on his work testing a variation to the accepted method of testing bar magnets. Also mentions his use of a ballistic galvanometer in an experiment carried out with the aid of William Henry Watkinson;\n27\nOctober\n1883\n- gives the results of tests carried out with Geoffrey A Jackson to ascertain the strength of magnetism in each part of some selected magnets;\n2\nNovember\n1883\n- concerns experiments with Geoffrey A Jackson on the strength of magnetism;\n29\nNovember\n1883\n- reports on experiments involving the weighing of electricity;\n27\nFebruary\n1884\n- gives tables of results of tests involving the use of a galvanometer and Clark's Cells;\n8\nMay\n1884\n- discusses adjustments to apparatus mentioning current standardizers;\n14\nMay\n1884\n- discusses the deficiencies of the current-standardizer;\n15\nMay\n1884\n- more on the defects of the current-standardizer;\n22\nMay\n1884\n- explains his delay in providing results of tests;\n23\nMay\n1884\n- gives further details on the current-standardizer;\n23\nMay\n1884\n- second report that day giving a table of results of tests on a second current-standardizer;\n26\nMay\n1884\n- gives further details on the current-standardizer with a table of results;\n29\nMay\n1884\n- reports on the arrival of a new design of current-standardizer;\n29\nMay\n1884\n- second report on this day describing further tests involving the current-standardizer, ammeters, Clark cells and magnetism. The report also mentions\nLord Rayleigh\nand ends with a table of results;\n30\nMay\n1884\n- gives results of an experiment involving the use of galvanometers. Report includes tables of results;\n2\nJune\n1884\n- reports on tests on an amperemeter.\nMcCowan sat the University of Glasgow M.A. examinations in Mathematics and Natural Philosophy in November\n1884\nbefore leaving to take up an appointment at the Royal College of Science in Dublin. At this College the Professor of Applied Mathematics was\nSir Robert Ball\nand the Professor of Physics was Sir William Barrett, both being very eminent scientists. In January\n1885\nMcCowan was proposed for membership of the\nEdinburgh Mathematical Society\nby\nThomas Muir\n, the proposal being seconded by\nAndrew Barclay\n. He was duly elected to the Society at the meeting of\n13\nFebruary\n1885\n. Having passed examinations in earlier years, he was awarded an M.A. with First Class Honours in Mathematics and Natural Philosophy by the University of Glasgow in\n1886\n. After four years in Dublin, McCowan returned to Scotland by\n1888\n, being appointed as a demonstrator of physics and assistant in mathematics to\nProfessor John Steggall\nat University College, Dundee. He held this position until his death. In his report on Session\n1888\n-\n89\nSteggall\nexplains new developments in the Department as well as noting McCowan's appointment\n[\n2\n]\n:-\n... the Mechanical Laboratory in the Technical Institute has been opened, and the students in my department have derived great advantage thereby: the additional space was much needed, and the propriety of the development of our laboratory work on the mechanical side of natural philosophy seems proved by the great interest taken by my students in this special branch of the work. The practical examinations in natural philosophy for the degree of B.Sc. at St Andrews largely consists of mechanics, and this gives us additional reason for appreciating the extension. The new lecture room has also proved of the greatest service. ... After five years' loyal service my friend Mr Capstick left us for Cambridge. He was succeeded by Mr John McCowan, whose attainments as a mathematical physicist have been of great value to my department.\nIn his report for Session\n1890\n-\n91\nSteggall\nwrites\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nI have much pleasure in reporting that my assistant Mr John McCowan has read and published three original papers during the past session; two of them dealing with Applied Mathematics are concerned with important problems on the conduction of heat in electrically heated conductors, and on the form of the solitary wave in water of finite depth.\nMcCowan read papers at meetings of the\nEdinburgh Mathematical Society\nfrequently during a very active period between\n1891\nand\n1895\n. The first paper he read was\nOn the heating of conductors by electric currents, and the electric distribution in conductors so heated\nat the meeting on\n9\nJanuary\n1891\n. The next paper, read on\n8\nMay\n1891\n, was\nOn the solitary wave\n. This paper, perhaps the most important work by McCowan, was published in\nPhilosophical Magazine\n. Here is a brief explanation of the context and main result of the paper:-\nBoussinesq\n(1877)\nwas responsible for the most frequently quoted profile of a wave. Interestingly, this followed from a first approximation to the effects of surface curvature on the hydraulic pressure assumption for long waves. McCowan applied\nStokes\n's notion for breaking to obtain the maximum relative height to breadth of\n0\n.\n78\n.\nThis brilliant work on waves led to him being awarded a D.Sc. in April\n1892\n. In his report on Session\n1891\n-\n92\nSteggall\nwrote about McCowan's lecturing duties and his D.Sc.\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nIn the evening an earnest class of four students took Senior Mathematics under Mr McCowan; while the Laboratory Class absorbed both his energies and mine on Wednesday evenings as usual. ... I have pleasure in reporting that Mr J McCowan, Assistant Lecturer and Demonstrator in my Department, has received the degree of D.Sc. under the new regulations, from the University of Glasgow, on presenting as credentials his original papers on wave motion and on heat conduction, to which I directed your attention last year.\nA regular attendee at meetings of the\nEdinburgh Mathematical Society\n, he presented the papers:\nOn a representation of elliptic integrals by curvilinear arcs\n(12\nJune\n1891)\n;\nOn the solution of non-linear partial differential equations of the second order\n(13\nMay\n1892)\n; and\nNote on the solution of partial differential equations by the method of reciprocation\n(11\nNovember\n1892)\n. At this meeting McCowan was elected to the Committee of the Society, then at the November meeting in the following year of\n1893\nhe was elected Vice-Chairman. He continued to present papers:\nOn ridge lines and lines connected with them\n(8\nDecember\n1893)\n;\nOn the highest wave of permanent type\n(8\nJune\n1894)\n; and\nOn the solitary permanent wave: a continuation\n(9\nNovember\n1894)\n. At this meeting he was elected as President of the Society. The paper\nOn the highest wave of permanent type\nwas published in the\nPhilosophical Magazine\nin\n1894\n. In it he proved that the breaking angle of a wave in shallow water is still\n120\n°, though it is tipped out of vertical symmetry. McCowan presented one further paper to the Society, namely\nOn the operation of division\non\n10\nApril\n1895\n.\nFlorian Cajori\n, in his\nA History of Mathematics\n(1893)\n, briefly discusses McCowan's contributions:-\nJ McCowan of University College at Dundee discussed this topic\n[\nwaves\n]\nmore fully and arrived at exact and complete solutions for certain cases.  ... methods of approximation were given by\nLord Rayleigh\nand John McCowan.\nIn his report on Session\n1897\n-\n98\nSteggall\nwrites\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nI need hardly add that I have been loyally supported by Dr McCowan, whose cooperation and advice I am always glad to receive.\nSadly McCowan' health deteriorated, forcing him to reduce his research activities. The cause of his illness appeared to be heart problems. In Session\n1898\n-\n99\nSteggall\nwrites\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nDr McCowan was prevented by illness from discharging his duties which were in consequence taken up by Mr Hugh Mitchell, B.Sc. of Edinburgh.\nFurther deterioration led to him being given six months leave from University College, Dundee, and he lived in Henderson Street, Bridge of Allan. Henderson Street is the main road through the centre of the small town and he now lived with his father William McCowan, who had by this time retired from his occupation as a tailor and clothier. His mother had died some years earlier. John McCowan died at\n6\na.m. on the morning of\n24\nNovember\n1900\n. The death certificate was signed by Dr James Hosack Fraser, an eminent Bridge of Allan doctor, and gives the cause of death as 'Heart Disease'.\nAt the meeting of the Edinburgh Mathematical Society on\n14\nDecember\n1900\n, the chairman, John Watt Butters, made a sympathetic reference to the death of Dr John McCowan who was president of the society during Session\n1894\n-\n95\n. At the meeting of the Society on\n11\nJanuary\n1901\nJohn Steggall\nexplained that the mathematical papers of the late Dr McCowan had been handed over to him \"for examination with a view to their ultimate publication\". It was agreed that\nSteggall\nshould consult with\nGeorge Alexander Gibson\n. The society hoped that some of Dr McCowan's papers could first of all be published in the Proceedings. In his report on Session\n1900\n-\n01\nSteggall\nwrites\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nThe early part of the session was marked by the sudden death of Dr McCowan, who had obtained leave of absence on account of ill-health. The College has lost one who was not only an admirable teacher, but also singularly gifted as a scholar, both as regards his erudition and his originality. his place has been taken by a former student in the Department, Mr R Norrie. It will be remembered that during the previous session the unexpected failure of Dr McCowan's health caused considerable inconvenience to the Departments of Mathematics and Physics. At the beginning of the present session we were still more unfortunate in the former department, for until the middle of November it was impossible to find a substitute.",
