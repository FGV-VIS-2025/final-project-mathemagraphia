  "biografia": "Very little is known of\nAntoine Parseval\n's life. We know that he was born into a family of high standing in France and he describes himself as a squire, certainly suggesting that his family were wealthy land-owners. One of the few pieces of information which exists is that he married Ursule Guerillot in\n1795\n. The marriage certainly did not last long and the pair were soon divorced.\nThe starting point of the historical events which were to play a major role in Parseval' life was the storming of the Bastille on\n14\nJuly\n1789\n. From this point the monarchy of Louis\n16\nth\nwas in major difficulties as the majority of Frenchmen put aside their differences and united behind an attempt to destroy the privileged establishment of the church and the state. Parseval, perhaps not surprisingly since he was of noble birth, was a royalist so for him the increasing problems for the monarchy meant that his life was more and more in danger.\nIn\n1792\nLouis\n16\nth\ngave up attempts at a compromise with opponents of the monarchy and tried to flee from France. He did not make it but was arrested and brought back to Paris. It was a time of great danger for royalist supporters and indeed it proved so for Parseval who was imprisoned in\n1792\n.\nFollowing the execution of the King on\n21\nJanuary\n1793\nthere followed a reign of terror with many political trials. By the end of\n1793\nthere were\n4595\npolitical prisoners held in Paris. However France began to have better times as their armies, under the command of Napoleon Bonaparte, won victory after victory. This may have been good news for France in general but royalists like Parseval, despite being freed from prison, remained in fear of their lives.\nNapoleon became first Consul in\n1800\nand then Emperor in\n1804\n. Parseval should have kept his head down if he wanted at avoid trouble but it was a time when it was almost impossible not to get drawn into the political events. Parseval published poetry against Napoleon's regime and, not surprisingly, had to flee from France when Napoleon ordered his arrest. He was successful in avoiding arrest and was able to return to Paris.\nParseval had only five publications, all presented to the\nAcadémie des Sciences\n. The first was\nMémoire sur la résolution des équations aux différences partielle linéaires du second ordre\nⓉ\n(\nMemoir on the resolution of linear partial differential equations of the second order\n)\ndated\n5\nMay\n1798\n, the second was\nMémoire sur les séries et sur l'intégration complète d'une équation aux differences partielle linéaires du second ordre, à coefficiens constans\nⓉ\n(\nMemoir on the series and the complete integration of a linear partial differential equation of the second order with constant coefficients\n)\ndated\n5\nApril\n1799\n, the third was\nIngégration générale et complète des équations de la propogation du son, l'air étant considéré avec les trois dimensions\nⓉ\n(\nGeneral Ingégration and complete equations of the propogation of sound, air being considered with three dimensions\n)\ndated\n5\nJuly\n1801\n, the fourth was\nIngégration générale et complète de deux équations importantes dans la mécanique des fluides\nⓉ\n(\nGeneral and complete Ingégration two important equations in fluid mechanics\n)\ndated\n16\nAugust\n1803\n, and finally\nMéthode générale pour sommer, par le moyen des intégrales définies, la suite donnée par le théorème de M Lagrange, au moyen de laquelle il trouve une valeur qui satisfait à une équation algébrique ou transcendente\nⓉ\n(\nGeneral method for summing by means of definite integrals, the series given by Lagrange's theorem, by means of which one finds a value that satisfies an algebraic or transcendental  equation\n)\ndated\n7\nMay\n1804\n.\nIt was the second of these, dated\n5\nApril\n1799\n, which contains the result known today as Parseval's theorem. Today this theorem is seen in the context of\nFourier series\n, and often also in more abstract settings which are quite far removed from Parseval's original ideas. The original theorem was concerned with summing infinite series. Parseval thought the result was obvious and only remarked that it followed by using\nde Moivre\n's result for\n(\ncos\n⁡\nx\n+\ni\nsin\n⁡\nx\n)\nn\n(\\cos x + i \\sin x)^{n}\n(\ncos\nx\n+\ni\nsin\nx\n)\nn\n. It also only worked, he noted, when certain imaginary parts of two complex numbers cancelled out. This he reasonably suggested was unfortunate and he hoped to remove this problem later. Indeed he did remove the problem and added a note to this effect in his\n1801\npublication. The improved version, as given in\n1801\n, states that if two series\nM\n=\n∑\na\nn\nx\nn\nM = \\sum  a_{n}x^{n}\nM\n=\n∑\na\nn\n​\nx\nn\nand\nm\n=\n∑\nb\nn\nx\nn\nm = \\sum  b_{n}x^{n}\nm\n=\n∑\nb\nn\n​\nx\nn\nare given then, substituting\nx\n=\ncos\n⁡\nu\n+\ni\nsin\n⁡\nu\nx = \\cos u + i \\sin u\nx\n=\ncos\nu\n+\ni\nsin\nu\n, and separating the answers into real and imaginary parts\nM\n=\np\n+\ni\nq\n,\nm\n=\nr\n+\ni\ns\nM = p+iq, m = r+is\nM\n=\np\n+\ni\nq\n,\nm\n=\nr\n+\ni\ns\n,\nthen\n2\na\n1\nb\n1\n+\na\n2\nb\n2\n+\na\n3\nb\n3\n+\na\n4\nb\n4\n+\n.\n.\n.\n=\n2\nπ\n∫\n0\nπ\np\nr\nd\nu\n2a_1 b_1 + a_2 b_2 + a_3 b_3 + a_4 b_4 + ... = \\large\\frac 2 {\\pi}  \\int_0^{\\pi}\\normalsize pr\\ du\n2\na\n1\n​\nb\n1\n​\n+\na\n2\n​\nb\n2\n​\n+\na\n3\n​\nb\n3\n​\n+\na\n4\n​\nb\n4\n​\n+\n.\n.\n.\n=\nπ\n2\n​\n∫\n0\nπ\n​\np\nr\nd\nu\nOf course we have modernised the notation, for example subscript notation was not used in Parseval's time, and we have also corrected his theorem for he omitted the first\n2\non the left hand side. The error may well have been a typographical error in printing the article.\nParseval's result was not widely known until his five papers were all published by the\nAcadémie des Sciences\nin\n1806\n. Before that it was known by members of the\nAcadémie\nand it appeared in works by\nLacroix\nand\nPoisson\nbefore Parseval's papers were printed.\nParseval was never honoured with election to the\nAcadémie des Sciences\n. He was proposed on five separate occasions, namely in\n1796\n,\n1799\n,\n1802\n,\n1813\nand\n1828\n. He was never particularly close although he did come third in\n1799\n, the year that\nLacroix\nwas elected. It would not be unfair to say that Parseval has fared well in having a well known result, which is quite far removed from his contribution, named after him. However he remains a somewhat shadowy figure and it is hoped that research will one day provide a better understanding of his life and achievements.",
