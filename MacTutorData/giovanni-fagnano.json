  "biografia": "Giovanni Fagnano\nwas the son of\nGiulio Fagnano\ndei Toschi. Giovanni was born into one of the leading families in Sinigaglia. The town of Sinigaglia, now known as Senigallia, is in central Italy and at the time of Giulio's birth was part of the Papal States. In fact the family went back very many generations in their association with Sinigaglia and one of the members of the family in the\n12\nth\ncentury had been Lamberto Scannabecchi who became Pope Honorius II in\n1124\n.\nGiovanni's father\nGiulio Fagnano\nheld high office in Sinigaglia. He was appointed gonfaloniere in\n1723\nwhen Giovanni was eight years old.\nGonfaloniere\nliterally means \"standard bearer\" and it was a title of high civic magistrates in the medieval Italian city-states such as Sinigaglia.\nGiovanni was one of many children in his family but the only one to follow his father's interest in mathematics. He entered the Church, being ordained priest, then appointed as canon of the cathedral in Sinigaglia in\n1752\n. In\n1755\nFagnano was appointed as archpriest, a very high rank to achieve.\nFagnano continued his father's work on the triangle and wrote an unpublished treatise on the topic. One theorem on the triangle which he discovered is worth quoting. He proved that given any triangle\nT\nT\nT\n, then the triangle whose vertices are the bases of the altitudes of\nT\nT\nT\nhas these altitudes as the bisectors of its angles.\nFagnano also considered integration computing the integrals of\nx\nn\nsin\n⁡\n(\nx\n)\nx^{n}\\sin(x)\nx\nn\nsin\n(\nx\n)\nand\nx\nn\ncos\n⁡\n(\nx\n)\nx^{n}\\cos(x)\nx\nn\ncos\n(\nx\n)\nby parts. In addition he calculated the integral of\ntan\n⁡\n(\nx\n)\n\\tan(x)\ntan\n(\nx\n)\nas\n−\nlog\n⁡\ncos\n⁡\n(\nx\n)\n-\\log \\cos(x)\n−\nlo\ng\ncos\n(\nx\n)\nand of cot\n(\nx\n)\n(x)\n(\nx\n)\nas\nlog\n⁡\nsin\n⁡\n(\nx\n)\n\\log \\sin(x)\nlo\ng\nsin\n(\nx\n)\n.\nSome of Fagnano's publications appear in the\nNova acta eruditorum\nⓉ\n(\nNew scholarly results\n)\nin\n1774\n. However, he never achieved the international standing of his father although he did publish some work outside Italy.",
