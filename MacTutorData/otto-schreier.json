  "biografia": "Otto Schreier\n's parents were Theodor Schreier\n(1873\n-\n1943)\nand Anna Turnau\n(1878\n-\n1942)\n. Theodor Schreier was born in Vienna, the son of the businessman Moritz Schreier and his wife Regina. Theodor was one of a large family having siblings Berthold, Rudolf, Alois, Max and Marie. He studied at the Vienna School of Technology and, from\n1899\nto\n1906\n, worked as a partner with Ernst Lindner\n(1870\n-\n1956)\nin the architect firm 'Ernst Lindner and Theodor Schreier'. After\n1906\nhe set up his own architect business and undertook major projects for the public sector such as schools, synagogues and office buildings. His most important work was designing the synagogue in St Pölten which was built in\n1912\n-\n13\n. Theodor married Anna and they had one child, Otto, the subject of this biography. The family was Jewish.\nIn\n1914\n, when Otto was thirteen years old, World War I broke out. Otto's father, Theodor, had undertaken military service before beginning to work as a partner in the architect's firm and, at the outbreak of war, he served in the Militärbaukommando which was involved in military construction. Otto studied at the Döblingen\nGymnasium\nsituated in the northwest of Vienna near the Vienna Woods. This school, which was excellent for mathematics and science, took a new approach emphasising English rather than Latin, Greek and French. This was not an easy time to be growing up in Vienna for, after the outbreak of World War I, in September\n1914\nthe Döblinger Gymnasium building was converted into a war hospital, and teaching was transferred to a secondary school building in the Krottenbachstrasse. In February\n1916\nthe war hospital closed and pupils returned to the original building.\nAt the Gymnasium there were two students who were one year older than Schreier, namely Richard Kuhn\n(1900\n-\n1967)\nand\nWolfgang Pauli\n. Both Kuhn and\nPauli\nwent on to win Nobel prizes; Kuhn was awarded the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in\n1938\nand\nPauli\nwas awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in\n1945\n. One year younger than Schreier was\nKarl Menger\nand the two became close friends. Schreier graduated from the Döblingen Gymnasium in July\n1919\nand, later that year, entered the University of Vienna to study mathematics. At Vienna he attended lecture courses by\nWilhelm Wirtinger\n(\non function theory and differential geometry\n)\n,\nPhilipp Furtwängler\n(\non algebra and number theory\n)\n,\nHans Hahn\n(\non set theory, and on real function theory and set theoretic geometry\n)\n,\nKurt Reidemeister\n(\non combinatorial topology\n)\n, Tonio Rella\n(1888\n-\n1945)\n, Josef Lense\n(1890\n-\n1985)\nand\nLeopold Vietoris\n. Schreier became even closer to\nMenger\nand he was the person that\nMenger\nturned to when he believed he had a major contribution to the notion of dimension\n[\n11\n]\n:-\nIn the first lecture\nHahn\nformulated the problem of making precise the idea of a curve, which no one had been able to articulate, mentioning the unsuccessful attempts of\nCantor\n,\nJordan\n, and\nPeano\n. The topology used in the lecture was new to\nMenger\n, but he \"was completely enthralled and left the lecture room in a daze\". After a week of complete engrossment, he produced a definition of a curve and confided it to fellow student Otto Schreier, who could find no flaw but alerted\nMenger\nto recent commentary by\nHausdorff\nand\nBieberbach\nas to the problem's intractability, which\nHahn\nhadn't mentioned.\nSchreier told\nMenger\nthat\nHausdorff\nhad written, \"the sets traditionally called curves are so heterogeneous that they do not fall under any reasonable collective concept,\" while\nBieberbach\nhad written, \"anyone trying to define the concept of a curve certainly would need a description as long as a tape worm, and of Gordian entanglement.\"\nMenger\napproached\nHahn\nwho\n[\n11\n]\n:-\n... after some thought agreed that\nMenger\n's was a promising attack on the problem.\nHowever, soon after this Menger became ill and went to a sanatorium in Aflenz in the mountains of Styria in southern Austria. He kept in close contact with Schreier who sent his lecture notes to\nMenger\n. Schreier wrote about the lectures he was attending:-\nHahn\n's lecture is extremely beautiful, although of course not such a polished product as his lectures from last winter. ...\nFurtwängler\ndid not get very far in his seminar, now he is treating the inessential\ndiscriminant\ndivisors ... Very pretty paper on\nFourier series\nin\nHahn\n's seminar ...\nLife was becoming worrying for Schreier as the National Socialists began to cause trouble. For example Schreier wrote to\nMenger\non\n28\nNovember\n1922\n(\nsee\n[\n2\n]\n)\n:-\nToday I received your kind letter with the new proof of the invariance theorem, which seems to me not only completely correct, but also much more transparent than the previous one ... . I will deliver the letter and the paper to\nHahn\ntomorrow, provided the German Nationalist students permit it. Indeed, all University institutes, including ours, have been occupied by certain student groups, who also obstructed the lectures.\nMenger\n's work on dimension was quite independent of that by\nPavel Samuilovich Urysohn\nwho sadly drowned in\n1924\nbefore publishing his results.\nMenger\nfelt that his own independent contributions had not been acknowledged as much as they should have been so in\n1926\nhe asked Schreier to verify the details of his contributions. This Schreier did in great detail giving dates and contents of all the correspondence he had had with\nMenger\nwhen he was in the sanatorium.\nSchreier had also told Menger in the same letter of November\n1922\nabout the new young lecturer who had just been appointed to Vienna,\nKurt Reidemeister\n:-\nThe new geometer Prof Dr\nKurt Reidemeister\nis an accomplished person. He is still very young\n(\nat most\n28\n, I would guess\n)\n, full of wit and high spirits. He has been recommended by\nBlaschke\n. In addition to the elementary course on analytic geometry he lectures two hours per week on topology. I attend this lecture, of course, although its confusion exceeds even\nWirtinger\n's worst ...\nReidemeister\n's lecture at the Mathematics Society was very pretty, although one absolutely could not follow towards the end. By his humorous remarks he caused such roaring laughter as has never been heard, so it seems, in the Mathematics Society.\nSchreier's doctorate, supervised by\nPhilipp Furtwängler\n, was awarded for a thesis\nÜber die Erweiterung von Gruppen\nⓉ\n(\nOn extensions of groups\n)\non\n8\nNovember\n1923\n. In this work he tackled a very fundamental group theory problem that had been posed by\nOtto Hölder\n:\nGiven two groups\nG\nG\nG\nand\nH\nH\nH\n, find all groups\nE\nE\nE\nhaving a normal subgroup\nN\nN\nN\nisomorphic to\nG\nG\nG\nsuch that the factor group\nE\n/\nN\nE/N\nE\n/\nN\nis isomorphic to\nH\nH\nH\n.\nAfter receiving his doctorate, Schreier went to Hamburg and worked until his death at the Mathematische Seminar. It was\nWilhelm Blaschke\nand\nErich Hecke\nwho recruited him to Hamburg having attended a lecture that Schreier gave at the\n1923\nmeeting of the\nGerman Mathematical Society\nheld in Marburg. However, even before this meeting, Schreier had been to Hamburg with\nReidemeister\nand got to know the mathematicians there. At Hamburg he was appointed to the post of assistant in the summer\n1925\nand worked for his\nhabilitation\n. He was happy in this environment, writing to\nMenger\nshortly after taking up the position\n(\nsee\n[\n2\n]\n)\n:-\nI even was invited by\nBlaschke\nfor dinner on Sunday evening; things were very festive.\nReidemeister\nentertained the whole society, and there was some playing of music... As soon as I can find time I will visit the harbour, which must surely be very impressive.\nAlthough he was pleased to be appointed as an assistant, he received no salary for at least the first year there and he could only live thanks to financial support from his parents. He shared a flat in Hamburg with\nHeinrich Behnke\nwho had been appointed as an assistant at Hamburg in\n1922\n.\nBehnke\nlater wrote about his friend\n(\nsee\n[\n2\n]\n)\n:-\nHe brought with him Viennese culture in the best sense. He was an enthusiastic disciple of\nHans Hahn\n, but had obtained his doctorate with\nFurtwängler\nthrough a work on group theory. In addition, his ideas had been greatly stimulated by\nWirtinger\n, the most renowned Austrian mathematician at the time. Thus the young Schreier was already by then an all-round mathematician. In addition, he was as gifted in music as in mathematics.\nIn fact Schreier gave lecture courses on group theory and analytic number theory, at the request of the mathematical faculty, before completing his habilitation. This was formally awarded on\n1\nDecember\n1926\nfor a thesis entitled\nDie Untergruppen der freien Gruppe\nⓉ\n(\nThe subgroups of free groups\n)\n. For his probationary lecture, a necessary part of habilitating, he chose to give\nOn the concept of a curve\n. His friendship with\nMenger\nclearly influenced his choice of topic which had to be understandable by non-mathematicians. However he had been appointed to a salaried position earlier, in fact in April\n1924\n. Hamburg was an exciting place for someone with Schreier's interests and, among others, he was influenced by\nEmil Artin\n. The two worked together on the theory of knots and of braids.\nSchreier married Edith Jakoby in\n1928\n. He was a keen musician and played the piano and it was when he went for piano lessons in Hamburg that the two had met. Edith was older than Schreier, had been married before but her first husband had been killed in World War I. She had a fourteen year old son. A few months after he married, Schreier was offered a professorship at the University of Rostock in\n1928\nand decided to accept the position but he preferred to wait until the summer of\n1929\nbefore taking up the post. During the beginning of the\n1928\n/\n29\nsession Schreier lectured on function theory giving parallel courses in Hamburg and Rostock. However, around Christmas of\n1928\n, an illness which had been steadily worsening prevented him from continuing with his lectures. He died five months later at the age of\n28\nof a 'general sepsis'. The sulpha drugs discovered a few years later probably would have saved his life and therefore would have greatly changed the development of combinatorial group theory.\nAlthough, as we have noted, many mathematicians influenced Schreier, the first were\nFurtwängler\nand\nReidemeister\n. His first paper in\n1924\nOn the groups\nA\na\nB\nb\n=\n1\nA^{a}B^{b} = 1\nA\na\nB\nb\n=\n1\ngave a simple algebraic proof of a theorem on knot groups, which generalised a theorem given by\nMax Dehn\nten years earlier that the trefoil knot and its mirror image are not equivalent. Schreier may have been directed towards the main theorem, which proves that certain torus knots were not isomorphic to their mirror images, by\nReidemeister\n. These knots gave rise to groups which were free products with an amalgamated subgroup and Schreier studied this property in detail in a\n1927\npaper. However, Schreier will be best remembered for his work on subgroups of free groups which he studied in his habilitation thesis. He published the results in\n1927\nin the paper\nDie Untergruppen der freien Gruppe\nⓉ\n(\nThe subgroups of the free group\n)\nwhich is described in\n[\n5\n]\nas:-\n... one of the most important papers ever published on combinatorial group theory. It took a long time for all its aspects to become effective, and it contains much more than the title indicates.\nIn January\n1926\nSchreier attended a lecture given by\nReidemeister\nin Hamburg on finding presentations for finite-index normal subgroups of finitely presented groups.\nReidemeister\npublished his method later in\n1927\n. Schreier, who was more interested in the algebraic implications of the method compared to\nReidemeister\n's more geometrical interests, was able to extend\nReidemeister\n's method to arbitrary subgroups and, by cleverly choosing generators for the subgroup, was able to greatly simplify the presentation obtained. These are now called\nReidemeister\n-Schreier presentations and while using them Schreier was able to prove that subgroups of free groups are free. Schreier published his method in his\n1927\npaper\nDie Untergruppen der freien Gruppe\nⓉ\n(\nThe subgroups of the free group\n)\n. Other work of Schreier is described in\n[\n5\n]\nas follows:-\n... Schreier made important contributions to other parts of group theory. The classical\nLie\ngroups ... can be considered as topological spaces. Schreier\n(1927)\nshowed that the fundamental group of such a space is always abelian. Schreier\n(1928)\nfound an important refinement of the fundamental\nJordan\n-\nHölder\ntheorem,\n39\nyears after the publication of\nHölder\n's paper. It is rare that such a widely used and basic theorem can be deepened after such a long time.\n(\nIn this case, something even more unusual happened.\nZassenhaus\n(1934)\ndiscovered a second improvement of the theorem.\n)\nFinally let us look at Schreier's famous textbook. This arose from the lectures that he gave in Hamburg. The first plan was for Schreier and\nArtin\nto collaborate in publishing their lecture notes but\nArtin\ndropped out of the project. However, Schreier became ill and died before he could prepare his lecture notes for publication.\nEmanuel Sperner\nwas a student at Hamburg who had been advised for his doctoral thesis by\nWilhelm Blaschke\nbut had been much influenced by Schreier's teaching and help. He stepped in to edit Schreier's lectures and to put them into book form.\nEinführung in die analytische Geometrie und Algebra\nⓉ\n(\nIntroduction to analytic geometry and algebra\n)\nwas published in two volumes, the first in\n1931\nand the second in\n1935\n. Henry George Forder, reviewing the first volume writes\n[\n6\n]\n:-\nSchreier intended eventually to publish his Hamburg lectures on analytical geometry and algebra in book form; and after his premature death in\n1929\nthese were completed and edited by his pupil\nSperner\n. Three-quarters of the present first volume discuss the analytical geometry of\nn\nn\nn\ndimensions and the relevant algebra in a unified way; no special knowledge is assumed, but considerable demands are often made on the attention of the reader. ... The second part, on the theory of fields, begins by pointing out that in the earlier portion the basic symbols need not represent real numbers, but may stand for any elements satisfying certain laws of combination. These laws are the postulates which define a \"field\". The investigation of the general laws of divisibility and of the factoring of polynomials over any field, and the usual introduction to ordinary complex numbers, lead up to an interesting proof of the fundamental theorem of algebra in the ordinary complex field, and with this the volume practically ends. The remarkable developments in algebra in the last few years, in which the Hamburg school has played a notable part, are not treated at all in this book, but here and there, as in the use of the word \"ideal\" to denote certain sets of polynomials, and in some of the proofs, their influence is seen.\nReviewing the second volume, Forder writes\n[\n7\n]\n:-\nThis final volume contains an introduction to the theory of\n(\nfinite\n)\nmatrices, which has already been published separately and is now out of print, together with a treatment of\nn\nn\nn\n-dimensional analytic geometry from the projective, affine and metric points of view, as far as the classification of quadrics. The work on matrices is very thorough and detailed and uses methods of proof that have been developed comparatively recently ...\nAn English translation appeared in\n1951\nunder the title\nIntroduction to Modern Algebra and Matrix Theory\n.\nKurt Hirsch\nwrites\n[\n9\n]\n:-\nOtto Schreier's \"Einführung in die Algebra und Analytische Geometrie\"\nⓉ\n(\nIntroduction to Algebra and Analytic Geometry\n)\n(\nedited by\nE Sperner\n)\nhas for many years been a favourite text-book for first year undergraduates in German universities. One of its unique features is the simultaneous treatment of fundamental concepts in algebra and in affine and projective geometry. The present skilful English translation has incorporated the \"Vorlesungen über Matrizen\"\nⓉ\n(\nLectures on Matrices\n)\n(\nas in the German second edition\n)\n, but has omitted the long final chapter on projective geometry in\nn\nn\nn\ndimensions. The result is that the accent is much more on the algebraic developments than in the original and that the geometry serves more as illustration than as motivation. This is also expressed in the changed title from which the reference to geometry has disappeared. ... The book can be thoroughly recommended both for private study and as a text-book for an enterprising Honours course combining algebra with geometry.\nT C Holyoke of Northwestern University writes in the review\n[\n10\n]\n:-\nThis outstanding book forms a good introduction to some of the topics and methods of modern algebra, and appears to be well suited for use as a text in a course of that nature. The treatment of the subject matter is concrete, and frequent geometric illustrations and motivations are given. The concepts of vector and linear transformation underlie and motivate the discussion throughout. The translation covers volume one and half of volume two of the\n1935\nGerman edition\n(\nwhich differs considerably from the\n1948\n-\n51\nedition\n)\n, omitting the chapter on projective geometry.\nThe part of the German text which was omitted from this English translation was published in\n1961\nas a separate book entitled\nProjective Geometry of n Dimensions\n. A J Knight writes\n[\n12\n]\n:-\nUnder the title of \"Introduction to Modern Algebra and Matrix Theory,\" the Chelsea company has already published a translation of part of Schreier and\nSperner\n's \"Einführung in die Analytische Geometrie und Algebra.\" The present volume forms a companion to this and has the same source. It is a nicely produced book, written in a pleasant style and incorporating the formality of carefully stated theorems in an atmosphere which is occasionally almost conversational. Of the twelve chapters, the first seven are devoted to projective spaces, co-ordinates, cross-ratio, projectivities, duality, and correlations. The remaining chapters contain a discussion of\nquadrics\nand their classification in projective, affine and metric spaces. Where necessary, the cases in which the number field is real or complex are contrasted and at the end of each chapter a number of illuminating examples is provided. The treatment of projectivities is particularly interesting and, not-withstanding an unfortunate impression, given in the opening paragraph, that the main purpose of projective geometry is to eliminate the distinction between intersecting and parallel lines, the book can be recommended as a rigorous introduction to\nn\nn\nn\n-dimensional geometry for second-year university students.\nLet us end by noting that Schreier's death in\n1929\nmeant that he died before Hitler's Nazi party came to power in\n1933\n. Their anti-Semitic policies had a major impact on the Jewish Schreier family. Anna, Otto's mother, died in the Theresienstadt concentration camp in October\n1942\nand Theodor, Otto's father, died in the same concentration camp in January\n1943\n. At least two of Otto's uncles were also murdered by the Nazis. Schreier's wife Edith was pregnant when Schreier died. Edith returned to Vienna where she was very close to Schreier's parents. Edith gave birth to Irene on\n1\nst July\n1929\n. Mother and daughter made it safely out of Vienna in January\n1939\nand arrived in San Francisco in March. Irene married Dana S Scott in October\n1959\n-- apparently having first been introduced at Princeton, when Irene was visiting\nArtin\n.",
