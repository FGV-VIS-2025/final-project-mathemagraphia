  "biografia": "Let us explain upfront why we have included a biography of\nStephen de Gurbs\ndespite him apparently having little to do with mathematics. I\n[\nEFR\n]\nwas asked by someone who won the \"De Gurbs Prize for Mathematics\" from the University of Aberdeen, \"Who was the mathematician de Gurbs?\". With the help of Isobel Falconer, we found some information about de Gurbs which we present below. His parents were, we believe, Stephen Gurbs and Ann Waller who were married\n18\nJuly\n1798\nin Southwark, London. As to the Gurbs family origins,\n[\n3\n]\nstates:-\nIt appears that Stephen Gurbs's father was a French peer who had fled from that country when the Revolution broke out.\nThis information will have come from Mrs de Gurbs but, as we shall see below, we need to treat her statements with some caution. However, we see no reason to doubt that the family were originally of French origin. We have seen no evidence that Stephen Gurbs used the name \"Stephen de Gurbs\" or \"Baron Stephen de Gurbs\" in his lifetime. All uses of these forms of his name that we have seen come after his death.\nThe first fact that we know of Stephen Gurbs, after his birth, is that he matriculated at King's College, Aberdeen in\n1823\n. Two things about this are a little strange. Why did someone born, and presumably brought up, in Surrey choose to go to Aberdeen for his university studies? As stated in\n[\n3\n]\n:-\nHow he came to Aberdeen is not known, but in\n1823\nhe entered King's College and attended for three sessions in succession.\nThe second slightly strange thing is that he was\n23\nyears of age when he began his university career, so was considerably older that most of the other students who matriculated in\n1823\n. Gurbs clearly was an outstanding student. He received an\n1823\nedition of\nThomas Simpson\n's book\nThe doctrine and application of fluxions\nas a prize for being the best student in natural philosophy\n(\nphysics\n)\n. This edition of the book was \"A new edition, carefully revised, and adapted, by copious appendixes, to the present advanced state of science by a graduate of the University of Cambridge.\" The date this prize was awarded is not recorded but we guess it was\n1825\n. Certainly, on\n24\nMarch\n1825\nhe was awarded the first prize for mathematics receiving the sixth edition of\nCharles Hutton\n's\nMathematical tables\nwhich had been published in\n1822\n. In April\n1826\nhe received the second edition of Robert Hamilton's\nMathematical tables\n(\npublished\n1816)\nas the first prize in the natural philosophy class. After the highly successful session\n1825\n-\n26\n, he was absent from the university for two years\n[\n3\n]\n:-\nThere was a lapse in his attendance of two sessions -\n1826\n-\n27\nand\n1827\n-\n28\n- during which time no record of him could be found. The following session, however, he returned to King's College, and in\n1829\nhe graduated and was the winner of the Hutton Prize, which goes to the most distinguished graduate of the year.\nExactly what Gurbs did following his graduation with an M.A. in\n1829\nis unclear. All we have been able to find is that he appears in the\n1841\nand\n1851\ncensus as living in London. In the census, as well as in various London directories in the\n1840\ns and\n50\ns, he gives his occupation as tutor, private tutor, or classical and mathematics tutor. All we can add to this is that he owned John Radford Young's\nThe elements of the differential calculus; comprehending the general theory of curve surfaces, and of curves of double curvature. Intended for the use of mathematical students in schools and universities\n. He also owned John Radford Young's\nThe elements of analytical geometry; comprehending the doctrine of the conic sections, and the general theory of curves and surfaces of the second order. Intended for the use of mathematical students in schools and universities\n. The editions of these two books that Gurbs owned were both published in\n1833\nand if he was using them for his tutoring, which seems likely, then he must have been tutoring in London at university level. Although we have no reason to believe Gurbs tutored students who were attending University College, London, nevertheless it is worth pointing out that teaching began there in\n1828\nwith\nAugustus De Morgan\nas the professor of mathematics.\nIn\n1869\n, when he was\n69\nyears of age, Gurbs married Eliza Hayward\n(1833\n-\n1918)\n. He was living at Montpeller Street, Brighton when he died in December\n1892\nat the age of\n92\n. He was buried in Highgate Cemetery, London and his widow erected a tombstone which reads:\nIn Loving Memory \n           of \nStephen Baron De Gurbs, M.A. \n   Born 31st March 1800\n Died 14th December 1892\n\"Beloved\" \"Lamented\"\nAlso of his mother \nwhose remains were removed \n   from the catacombs \n      to this grave.\nThis is the first time that we find the name \"Baron De Gurbs\" used.\nYou can see pictures of the tombstone at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nOn\n6\nMarch\n1899\n, Eliza Gurbs changed her name to Elise, Baroness de Gurbs, placing notice of this change of name in\nThe Times\n. She must have already made a trip to visit King's College, Aberdeen, since we see the following report in\n1902\nin\n[\n3\n]\n:-\nIn connection with the unexpected gift of a memorial window to the University of Aberdeen by the Baroness De Gurbs in memory of her late husband, the Baron De Gurbs, as intimated at a meeting of the University Court yesterday, it is interesting to note that four or five years ago the baroness paid her first visit to Aberdeen and called at King's College. She appeared greatly interested in everything she saw, and on entering the library she asked the librarian, Mr P J Anderson, if the old records of the college were still accessible, and whether the name of Gurbs appeared in them. Mr Anderson very soon found the name of Stephen Gurbs, who entered the college in\n1823\n. About three weeks ago Mr Anderson was favoured with a second visit from the baroness, who intimated that the purpose of her visit was to arrange about presenting to the university a memorial window in remembrance of her husband.\nFor the full report\n[\n3\n]\n, see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nThe meeting of the university court referred to in this quote must have taken place on Tuesday\n11\nMarch\n1902\n. Just a few days before that, on\n1\nMarch\n1902\n, the following appeared in\nNotes and Queries\n[\n4\n]\n:-\nGurbs or De Gurbs Barony. Stephen Gurbs, Surrey, matriculated at King's College, Aberdeen, in\n1823\n, and took the degree of M.A. there in\n1829\nas Hutton Prizeman i.e., the most distinguished graduate of the year. He appears to have been known in later life as the Baron de Gurbs. Information is desired as to this barony. Q. K. B.\nWe have not worked out who \"Q. K. B.\" was but clearly it was someone associated with King's College since the same Q. K. B. posted three other queries about King's College in the\nScottish Notes and Queries\nin\n1902\n. Two of these are\n[\n5\n]\n:-\n(\ni\n)\nWhen did students finally cease to reside in King's College?\n(\nii\n)\nKing's College Chapel, Bishops preaching in. - On Sunday,\n23\nrd February,\n1902\n, Dr John Wordsworth, Bishop of Salisbury, preached in the University Chapel, King's College. When did a bishop officiate there before? Not, in all probability, for\n214\nyears at least.\nIt is clear that the university authorities did not believe that Gurbs had been a Baron and that his widow was a Baroness. The report\n[\n3\n]\neven ends with quoting Q. K. B.'s\nNotes and Queries\nquestion about the De Gurbs barony.\nIn\n1904\nthe \"De Gurbs stained glass window\" in the King's College Chapel was dedicated. A report of the dedication service appeared in\nThe Aberdeen Daily Journal\non Monday\n21\nNovember\n1904\n.  For this description of the service see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nAt the service Principal Lang gave a very fine speech but speaking of Gurbs he said\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nBut it is the scantiness of the information that we possess that lends a special interest to the ceremony of this afternoon.\nPrincipal Lang clearly knew nothing more than Gurbs's undergraduate record, yet Gurbs's wife was present at the service. He also explained why the De Gurbs window was unique\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nIt is the seventh memorial window in this ancient chapel. But it is unique in some of its circumstances. The sixth window, excluding your own, the one in the west ante-chapel and those on either side of me in the apse, are tributes to men who filled and adorned conspicuous positions in the university, the one exception being the memorial to Professor Robertson Smith, an Aberdeen graduate whose fame and reputation were world-wide. He to whose memory you have offered this loving token had no other special relation to the university than that of an alumnus who, when he passed through King's College, seemed to have bidden farewell to academic halls and pursuits.\nWe have not copied out the rather fine description of the De Gurbs window which is given in\n[\n2\n]\n. A picture of the window is at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nThe window contains the names of 'Stephen Baron De Gurbs' and 'Elise Baroness De Gurbs'. It also has a representation of Baron De Gurbs's coronet which you can see at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nEliza Gurbs, or Elise Baroness De Gurbs to give her the name she chose in\n1899\n, died in\n1918\nand in the following year her husband's books went to the library of the University of Aberdeen. There appear to be eleven books in the bequest, five of which we have mentioned above. The mathematics books, in addition to the five already mentioned, are: Samuel Ferdinand Lubbe,\nTraité de calcul différentiel et de calcul intégral\nⓉ\n(\nTreatise on differential calculus and integral calculus\n)\n(1832)\n; Thomas Keith,\nAn introduction to the theory and practice of plane and spherical trigonometry, and the stereographic projection of the sphere; including the theory of navigation: comprehending a variety of rules, formulae, &c. with their practical applications to the mensuration of heights and distances; to determining the latitude by two altitudes of the sun, the longitude by the lunar observations, and to other important problems on the sphere, and on nautical astronomy\n(1820)\n;\nSilvestre François Lacroix\n,\nTraité élémentaire de calcul différentiel et de calcul intégral\nⓉ\n(\nBasic treatise on differential calculus and integral calculus\n)\n(1806)\n; and\nSilvestre François Lacroix\n,\nComplément des Élémens d'algèbre, à l'usage de l'École centrale des quatre-nations\nⓉ\n(\nSupplement to the elements of algebra, for the use of the Central School of the Four Nations\n)\n(1800)\n.\nIn addition of the books, Eliza Gurbs also left money to fund the De Gurbs Prize in Mathematics and a De Gurbs Prize in Literature at the University of Aberdeen. I have also seen mention of a De Gurbs Scholarship at the University of Aberdeen which again must come from money left to the University by Eliza Gurbs.\nI\n[\nEFR\n]\nfind this a fascinating tale since although the Eliza Gurbs appears to have been a rogue with ideas above her position in making her husband a Baron after his death and making herself a Baroness, nevertheless, she certainly did much good with giving money for a very fine stained glass window which still adorns the chapel and in funding a De Gurbs prize in mathematics which had now been awarded for almost\n100\nyears.",
