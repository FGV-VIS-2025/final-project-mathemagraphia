  "biografia": "Aldo Ghizzetti\n's parents were Ernesto Ghizzetti and Irene Centenari. Aldo attended the scientific high school in Turin where he was fortunate to be taught mathematics by\nGuido Ascoli\n. It was\nAscoli\nwho immediately noticed the exceptional talents of his young student and advised him to think of making a career in mathematics. After graduating from the high school, Ghizzetti entered the University of Turin. There were a number of outstanding mathematicians on the staff at Turin, including\nGuido Fubini\n,\nGino Fano\n, and\nAlessandro Terracini\n. Ghizzetti was advised by\nTerracini\nwhen undertaking research for his laurea and he graduated in\n1930\n. He published\nDeterminazione delle curve limiti di un sistema continuo\n∞\n1\ndi curve piane omografiche\nⓉ\n(\nDetermination of the limits curves of a continuous system of ∞\n1\nhomographic plane curves\n)\n(1936)\nwhich summarises the results of his thesis. The paper\nSulle curve limiti di un sistema continuo\n∞\n1\ndi curve piane omografiche\nⓉ\n(\nOn the limits curves of a continuous system of ∞\n1\nhomographic plane curves\n)\n(1936)\n, published later the same year, gives full proofs of the results of his thesis. The authors of\n[\n1\n]\ncall this a \"marvellous article\" and explain that in his thesis\n(\nand this paper\n)\n:-\n... he determined the limits of one-parameter families of 'homographic' plane curves\n(\nthat is, of curves in the same orbit under the PGL\n(3)\naction\n)\n.\nAfter completing the work for his thesis Ghizzetti was appointed as an assistant to teach mathematical analysis at Turin Polytechnic. Then, remaining at the Turin Polytechnic, he became an assistant teaching geometry there. His lecture course for session\n1939\n-\n40\nwas published in lithographed form under the title\nLezioni di Geometria Analitica con elementi di Proiettiva\nⓉ\n(\nLessons in analytical geometry  with elements of projective geometry\n)\n. He was strongly influenced by\nGuido Fubini\nand, at\nFubini\n's suggestion, he began to study the theory of\nLaplace transformations\nin particular looking to use the technique in applications to electrical engineering. He published\nSull'uso della trasformazione di Laplace nello studio dei circuiti elettrici\nⓉ\n(\nOn the use of the Laplace transform in the study of electrical circuits\n)\n(1937)\n, and\nLa trasformazione di Laplace e il calcolo simbolico degli elettrotecnici\nⓉ\n(\nLaplace transformation and symbolic computation for electric circuit theory\n)\n(1941)\nwhich provided an expository representation of the symbolic calculus of electric circuit theory based on the\nLaplace\ntransformation. His work on this topic culminated in the monograph\nCalcolo simbolico. La Trasformazione di Laplace e il Calcolo Simbolico degli Elettrotecnici\nⓉ\n(\nSymbolic calculation. The Laplace Transformation and symbolic computation for electrical engineers\n)\n(1943)\n. Albert E Heins writes in a review of this book:-\nThe aim of this monograph is to supply a treatment of the\nLaplace\ntransform and its applications to electric circuit theory. Accordingly, the main body of the text is divided into four parts. Part one provides an elementary discussion of the unilateral\nLaplace\ntransform. In addition to derivation of the basic properties of this transform, applications are indicated to ordinary linear differential equations with constant coefficients as well as systems of such equations. A brief discussion of\nBessel\nand theta functions is included. In the next three parts, the author applies the basic material to the solution of some of the ordinary and partial differential equations in electrotechnics. In part two, differential equations arising in lumped circuit phenomena are handled. In parts three and four, transmission lines and electric filters are discussed.\nBefore the publication of this monograph, Ghizzetti had left Turin and moved to Rome. It was in\n1939\nthat\nLamberto Cesari\nleft his position at deputy director of the Istituto Nazionale per le Applicazioni del Calcolo of the Italian National Council for Research in Rome when he was appointed as 'professore incaricato'\n(\nassistant professor\n)\nat the University of Pisa.\nMauro Picone\n, who had founded the Institute in\n1927\nand was its director, appointed Ghizzetti as deputy director to replace\nCesari\n. Ghizzetti took up the appointment on\n1\nNovember\n1940\n. He continued his practice of producing the notes from his lecture courses in lithographed form, producing\nCalcolo delle probabilità\nⓉ\n(\nCalculation of probabilities\n)\nfor his\n1940\n-\n41\nand\n1941\n-\n42\ncourses. After beginning work in Rome, his research interests moved towards the theory of moments and the theory of partial differential equations. He published a series of papers in\n1942\n:\nSui momenti di una funzione limitata\nⓉ\n(\nOn the moments of a bounded function\n)\n;\nRicerche sui momenti di una funzione limitata compresa fra limiti assegnati\nⓉ\n(\nInvestigation of the moments of a bounded function between specified limits\n)\n;\n(\nwith\nRenato Caccioppoli\n)\nRicerche asintotiche per una particolare equazione differenziale non lineare\nⓉ\n(\nAsymptotic research for a particular non-linear differential equation\n)\n;\n(\nwith\nRenato Caccioppoli\n)\nRicerche asintotiche per una classe di sistemi di equazioni differenziali ordinarie non lineari\nⓉ\n(\nAsymptotic research for a class of systems of nonlinear ordinary differential equations\n)\n; and most importantly\nSui problemi di Dirichlet per la striscia e per lo strato\nⓉ\n(\nOn the Dirichlet problem for the strip and the layer\n)\n.\nThe Scuola Normale Superiore of Pisa suffered severely during the war. Pisa was bombed by the Americans on\n31\nAugust\n1943\nand the buildings of the Scuola Normale, used as a barracks by German troops during the war, were badly damaged. Pisa was liberated by the Allies on\n2\nSeptember\n1944\nand on\n25\nSeptember\n1945\nrestoration of the Scuola Normale began.\nAlessandro Faedo\nwas appointed in\n1946\nand began a series of brilliant appointments building Pisa into a world leading mathematical centre. One of these appointments was Ghizzetti who took up the chair of mathematical analysis at the Scuola Normale Superiore of Pisa in\n1948\n. The lecture course he gave at the University of Pisa in\n1948\n-\n49\nwas published in lithographed form as\nLezioni di Analisi Matematica\nⓉ\n(\nLectures in mathematical analysis\n)\n. He only remained at Pisa for a year but during this time he reorganised and directed the\nAnnals of the Scuola Normale Superiore\n. In\n1949\nhe returned to Rome when appointed to the chair of mathematical analysis at the University of Rome. Over the following few years he produced new editions of his lecture course\nLezioni di Analisi Matematica\nⓉ\n(\nLectures in mathematical analysis\n)\n. When\nPicone\nretired as director of the Istituto Nazionale per le Applicazioni del Calcolo in\n1960\n, Ghizzetti was appointed to succeed him as director. He continued to hold these positions until he retired in\n1978\n.\nOne of the areas of research that occupied Ghizzetti was the study of approximation theory and he also lectured on this topic in Rome during the\n1950\ns. His lecture notes, entitled\nLezioni di analisi superiore\n(\nTeoria dell'approssimazione lineare\n)\nⓉ\n(\nLessons in higher analysis\n(\ntheory of linear approximation\n)\n)\n, contained work on approximation theory and they were published in lithographed form in\n1955\n-\n56\n. In collaboration with Alessandro Ossicini, Ghizzetti wrote\nQuadrature formulae\nⓉ\n(\nQuadrature formulas\n)\nwhich was among the most comprehensive treatments of the subject in the one-dimensional case. The monograph was published in\n1970\nand reviewed by\nJohn Todd\nwho writes\n[\n6\n]\n:-\nQuadrature formulae have been discovered by such great mathematicians as\nGauss\n,\nNewton\n,\nChebyshev\n, and by not-so-great ones. The advent of automatic computation has revived the interest in these formulae, and several recent books are concerned with this subject. ...  A general principle for the construction of such formulae is obvious: \"to get an approximation to a definite integral of a function f, take an approximation p to f\n(\ne.g. a polynomial, or a spline\n)\nand integrate.\" The error can be estimated by integrating the error in the approximation. The main theme of this monograph is the determination of the weights and the errors in quadrature formulae by a uniform method. This method, which goes back to\nPeano\n(1913)\n, and had been exploited by\nvon Mises\n(1935)\nand\nRadon\n(1935)\n, has been examined intensively by the authors. The basis for the method is the\nGreen\n-\nLagrange\nidentity associated with a linear differential operator. Numerical analysts, particularly those who are unfamiliar with Italian, will be glad to have this connected account of research by Ghizzetti and his school, but will often shiver at the unusual treatment of our language and will occasionally have to reinterpret phrases.\nThe author of\n[\n5\n]\n, also reviewing\nQuadrature formulae\n, writes:-\nDuring the last fifteen years the authors have developed an approach to the construction of quadrature formulae based on earlier work of\nVon Mises\nand\nRadon\nin\n1935\n... the part of this book which deals with the theory should be of interest to research workers in the field of numerical quadrature. The remainder of the book consists of a repository of special derivations of quadrature formulae using this new method, and may be of interest to research workers.\nGhizzetti also collaborated with Alessandro Ossicini to produce a new version of his\n1943\nbook. This new work, entitled\nTrasformate di Laplace e calcolo simbolico\nⓉ\n(\nLaplace transforms and symbolic computation\n)\nwas published in\n1971\n. Ten years later, in\n1981\n, the same two authors published\nPolinomi ortogonali e problema dei momenti\nⓉ\n(\nOrthogonal polynomials and the problem of moments\n)\nwhich, as the title indicates, surveys of the connection between orthogonal polynomials and the moment problem. In fact Ghizzetti had begun to combine ideas on special functions with his work on approximation theory during the\n1960\ns. A feature of this work involved extending the classical concept of orthogonal polynomials to s-orthogonal polynomials and studying their associated series expansions. His work also extended to examining applications of mathematics to various different physical situations. For example, he worked on applications to the oscillations of water in hydraulic systems, the theory of elasticity, and\nprobability theory\n. In fact his publication record was outstanding and\nAlessandro Faedo\nlists\n193\nitems in\n[\n3\n]\n. We should also note that he collaborated with a large number of his colleagues in joint work. Here is the list of his collaborators\n(\npresented roughly in the order in which they wrote their first joint work with Ghizzetti\n)\n: Rinaldo Perassi, Carlo Ferrari, Camillo Possio,\nRenato Caccioppoli\n,\nMauro Picone\n, Antonio Borsellino,\nCarlo Miranda\n, Silvio Cinquini, Luigi Amerio, A M Libori, G Cordelia,\nEnnio De Giorgi\n, Luigi Marchetti, Corrado Böhm, G Gullotta, Wolf Gross, Paolo Ercoli, Andreina Morelli, Jolanda Verna, Maria Sofia Roma, Alessandro Ossicini, Francesco Rosati, Laura Nicolò-Amati Gori, Vittorio Mongiardini, Marisa Venturini Zilli, V Ceccarini, Bruna Germano, Francesco Mazzarella, and Lia Santucci Patini.\nGhizzetti was honoured for his contributions in several different ways. He was elected president of the Associazione Italiana per l'Informatica ed il Calcolo Automatico from\n1961\nto\n1964\n. He was elected to the Academy of Sciences of Madrid in\n1953\n, and made a corresponding member of the\nAcademy of Sciences of Turin\nin\n1959\n. In\n1978\nhe became a full member of this academy. His greatest honour was election to the\nAccademia dei Lincei\n. He was made a corresponding member of the Academy in\n1980\nand became a full member seven years later.\nIn December\n1992\n, he died following a long and painful illness.\nAlessandro Faedo\nwrites in the obituary\n[\n3\n]\nthat he:-\n... earned my respect and friendship for over half a century.",
