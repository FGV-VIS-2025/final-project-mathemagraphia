  "biografia": "John Meldrum\nwas the son of Rev Philip Austin Louis Meldrum\n(1907\n-\n1973)\nand Marie Ruth Abadia\n(1905\n-\n1989)\n. Philip Meldrum was born on\n7\nOctober\n1907\nin Ipswich, Suffolk, England, the son of the tool maker for agricultural engineers Thomas Henry Meldrum\n(1863\n-\n1934)\nand his wife Elizabeth Taylor\n(1866\n-\n1935)\n. Philip became a Clerk in Holy Orders and on the\n26\nJanuary\n1934\nhe sailed from London going to Tangier on the\nStrathnaver\n. He was going to Morocco as a missionary and stated that he intended Morocco to be his future permanent residence. He returned to England on\n16\nNovember\n1935\nand, on\n4\nJanuary\n1936\n, married Marie Ruth Abadia at St Johns Church in Upper Holloway, London. On\n10\nJanuary\n1936\nthe newly married couple sailed on the\nMooltan\nfrom London on their way back to Morocco. Marie Ruth Abadia had been born on\n5\nApril in Beirut, Lebanon. She spent time in England and at the age of\n16\nwas living in Bristol. In October\n1927\nshe sailed from Port Said to London with the intention of qualifying as a midwife. She lived at\n16\nLincoln's Inn Fields, London for several years but went to Morocco, sailing back to Plymouth, England from Tangier on\n12\nDecember\n1935\nabout three weeks before her wedding.\nOn\n15\nJuly\n1938\nPhilip and Ruth Meldrum sailed from Morocco to London and went to live at\n31\nDurdham Park, Bristol. On\n23\nSeptember\n1938\ntheir first child Sonia Pauline Marguerite Meldrum\n(1938\n-\n2024)\nwas born in Bristol. The family returned to Morocco leaving London on\n6\nApril\n1939\non the\nStratheden\n. Let us note at this point that Sonia married Derek Ryder on\n7\nSeptember\n1963\nin Cambridge, England. She died on\n6\nMarch\n2024\n.\nPhilip and Ruth Meldrum's second child, John Meldrum, the subject of this biography, was born in Rabat, Morocco on\n18\nJuly\n1940\n. He was brought up to speak both English and French and his primary education was at the Petit Lycée Lyautey in Casablanca. At this time Morocco was a French protectorate and the school was a French institution named for Marshal Louis Hubert Gonzalve Lyautey, who was the first French resident general in Morocco. The school had been founded in\n1929\nand a few years later it also took middle school students. Meldrum graduated from the Petit Lycée Lyautey, and continued his education at the Grand Lycée Lyautey.\nOn\n2\nMarch\n1956\nMorocco gained its independence from France. The Meldrum family left Casablanca and sailed to London on the\nWickenburgh\narriving on\n7\nAugust\n1956\n. They had already arranged for Sonia attend the Clarendon School for Girls in Abergele, Wales and for John to attend Ipswich School in Ipswich. On the form filled in by incoming passengers, they state that Philip and Marie Meldrum intended to stay in Britain for five months before returning to Casablanca, but Sonia would become permanent residents of North Wales and John would become a permanent resident of Suffolk.\nIpswich School is a famous independent school with a long history beginning in the\n15\nth century. It is the only school mentioned by name in Shakespeare's plays. Meldrum spent two years at the school, entering the Lower VI in September\n1956\n. He joined the Debating Society and took part in a debate on Friday\n30\nNovember\n1956\n. The motion debated was that \"This House considers that Democracy means the government of the House by its Nursery.\"\nThe Ipswichian\nreported\n[\n17\n]\n:-\nJ D P Meldrum spoke first. He considered that voters generally were extremely inexperienced, especially the younger ones. This situation was aggravated by politics being a very difficult subject. However, he made it clear that he was not attacking democracy itself.\nMeldrum sat the University of Cambridge scholarship examination in December\n1957\nand was awarded an exhibition to Emmanuel College Cambridge.  He sat his A-level examinations in\n1958\nand began his studies of the Mathematical Tripos at Cambridge in October\n1958\n. In\n1959\n, he took Part I of the Mathematics Tripos, gaining a first class. He was a\nWrangler\nin Part II in\n1961\nand graduated with a B.A. degree. Already an Open Exhibitioner, a State Scholar, a Pemberton and Smart Exhibitioner, he was elected to a Bachelor Scholarship of Emmanuel College, Cambridge in\n1961\n.\nMeldrum had been taught at Cambridge by a remarkable number of leading mathematicians.\nAbram Besicovitch\nhad retired the year Meldrum began his studies and had been replaced as\nRouse Ball\nProfessor of Mathematics by\nHarold Davenport\n. There was\nPhilip Hall\nat King's College who, by that time, held the Sadleirian Chair but did not supervise undergraduates. In addition there was\nWilliam Hodge\nwho was Lowndean Professor of Astronomy and Geometry. Also lecturers in the Mathematics faculty at this time were\nFrank Adams\n,\nMichael Atiyah\n,\nJ W S\n(\nIan\n)\nCassels\n, Peter Swinnerton-Dyer,\nJohn Arthur Todd\nand\nChris Zeeman\n. There were three very talented students studying group theory at Cambridge at the same time as Meldrum, all slightly older than him. Trevor Hawkes entered Trinity College Cambridge in\n1957\nand took Part III of the Mathematical Tripos in\n1961\n.\nBrian Hartley\nalso matriculated at the University of Cambridge in October\n1957\nand took Part III of the Mathematical Tripos in\n1961\n. Derek J S Robinson studied at the University of Edinburgh for his first degree, awarded in\n1960\n, then undertook research at Cambridge advised by\nPhilip Hall\n. He was awarded a Ph.D. in\n1963\nfor his thesis\nTheory of Subnormal Subgroups\n.\nMeldrum took Part III of the Mathematical Tripos in\n1962\nand, like his three fellow students we have just mentioned, decided to undertake research in group theory. He began research in October\n1962\nat the University of London where his thesis advisors were\nKurt Hirsch\nand\nKarl Gruenberg\n. He was re-elected to a Bachelor Scholarship of Emmanuel College in\n1963\nand returned to Cambridge where his official thesis advisor was Derek Roy Taunt\n(1917\n-\n2004)\n. He was appointed as a Supernumerary Fellow and College Lecturer in Mathematics at Emmanuel in\n1964\nand in the same year he was awarded the\nRayleigh\nprize in mathematics. In\n1965\nhe was appointed Director of Studies in Mathematics at New Hall and Emmanuel College. Meldrum was awarded his Ph.D. in\n1966\nfor his thesis\nCentral series in wreath products\n. He published a paper with the same title in\n1967\nbased on results from his thesis. In it he writes\n[\n12\n]\n:-\nI would like to thank Professor\nK A Hirsch\nand Dr\nK W Gruenberg\nunder whose supervision this work was begun, and Dr D R Taunt under whose supervision this work was continued, for their helpful advice and criticism. I would also like to thank Dr H Liebeck for many helpful discussions and the referee for several helpful suggestions. Part of this work was undertaken while I held a D.S.I.R. Research Studentship for which I thank them.\nWhile he was a student in Cambridge, Meldrum attended St Barnabas Church. There he met Patricia Sealey, the daughter of car manufacturing worker William Cecil Sealey\n(1910\n-\n1999)\nand his wife Kathleen Mary Blundell\n(1916\n-\n2003)\n, who had been born in Watford, England on\n25\nApril\n1944\n. John and Pat Meldrum were married on\n30\nMarch\n1968\nat St Paul's Church in Cambridge. They had two children, Elizabeth Mary Meldrum\n(\nborn\n26\nMarch\n1970)\nand David Meldrum\n(\nborn\n13\nAugust\n1973)\n.\nElizabeth Meldrum, known as Liz, studied mathematics at the University of Cambridge\n(1988\n-\n91)\nthen qualified as a teacher with a PGCE from Cambridge\n(1991\n-\n92)\n. She married the software engineer Marius Charles Milner\n(\nborn June\n1970)\nin Edinburgh in\n1992\n, was a High School Mathematics Teacher at Davenant Foundation School, London\n(1992\n-\n1996)\n, was awarded a Master of Divinity from Fuller Theological Seminary\n(2016)\n, and is now Executive Director, Chaplain Services, Santa Clara County Jail. Marius and Liz Milner have three children: Abigail Elizabeth Milner\n(\nborn October\n1997)\n; Emily M Milner\n(\nborn in May\n2000)\n; and Thomas Marius Milner\n(\nborn on\n20\nSeptember\n2002)\n.\nDavid Meldrum writes that he is\n[\n14\n]\n:-\n... a British vicar living in Cape Town since\n2010\n, working as the minister in charge of St Peter's church, Mowbray. I'm married to Bev since\n1999\nand have two foster children. I was born in Edinburgh and raised in Edinburgh, studied English Literature at St Andrews University and then lived in London from\n1996\nuntil moving to Cape Town. I'm a third generation Arsenal fan\n(\nbecause my Mum told me to be\n)\n; and love most sports. I'm passionate about films, stories, homelessness and much else besides. I live with a degenerative arthritic condition affecting the spine and other joints\n(\nAnkylosing Spondylitis\n)\n, depression, anxiety and PTSD.\nJohn Meldrum was appointed as a Lecturer in Mathematics at the University of Edinburgh, Scotland, taking up the post on\n1\nOctober\n1969\n. The authors of\n[\n10\n]\nwrite:-\nAfter moving to Edinburgh in\n1969\nthe Meldrum family was very active in St Thomas's Episcopal Church, Corstorphine, serving in many roles, including vestry prayer groups and as small group leaders. Certainly, religion was a large part of their married life.\nBoth children recall a very happy home life with much joy and laughter; they recall John telling the same jokes many times over. John and Pat loved hosting people for dinner parties, and were generous with hospitality and fellowship with church friends, mathematical colleagues, graduate students, and visitors. Both authors can attest to this.\nFor a brief overview of Meldrum's research achievements we note that he published around\n75\npapers in top quality journals. His early work on groups, particularly wreath products of groups, led him to become a leading researcher in near-rings. He did much research on the connections between distributively generated near-rings and groups. The authors of\n[\n10\n]\ngive an excellent overview of Meldrum's contributions for readers with a good background in group theory. Let us only give here the basic definition of a distributively generated near-ring:\nA near-ring\nR\nR\nR\nis a system with two binary operations, addition and multiplication, such that:\n(\ni\n)\nThe elements of\nR\nR\nR\nform a group under addition,\n(\nii\n)\nThe elements of\nR\nR\nR\nform a semigroup under multiplication,\n(\niii\n)\nx\n(\ny\n+\nz\n)\n=\nx\ny\n+\nx\nz\nx(y+z) = xy+xz\nx\n(\ny\n+\nz\n)\n=\nx\ny\n+\nx\nz\n, for all\nx\n,\ny\n,\nz\n∈\nR\nx, y, z \\in   R\nx\n,\ny\n,\nz\n∈\nR\n.\nIn particular, if\nR\nR\nR\ncontains a multiplicative semigroup\nS\nS\nS\nwhose elements generate\nR\n+\nR^{+}\nR\n+\nand satisfy\n(\niv\n)\n(\nx\n+\ny\n)\ns\n=\nx\ns\n+\ny\ns\n(x+y)s = xs+ys\n(\nx\n+\ny\n)\ns\n=\nx\ns\n+\ny\ns\n, for all\nx\n,\ny\n∈\nR\nx, y \\in   R\nx\n,\ny\n∈\nR\nand\ns\n∈\nS\ns \\in   S\ns\n∈\nS\n,\nthen\nR\nR\nR\nis a distributively generated near-ring.\nMeldrum wrote two important books, namely\nNear-rings and their links with groups\n, published in\n1985\nand\nWreath products of groups and semigroups\n, published in\n1995\n. For more information about these books, see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nSince Meldrum was educated in French up to the age of sixteen he was equally at home speaking French or English. He used his bilingual talents to translate. For example he translated\nÉléments d'histoire des mathématiques\nⓉ\n(\nElements of the history of mathematics\n)\n(1984)\nby\nNicolas Bourbaki\nand it was published in\n1994\nas\nElements of the history of mathematics\n. He was also asked to review many papers and books and was well-known for the high quality of these reviews.\nI\n[\nEFR\n]\nwas appointed to the University of St Andrews in\n1968\nand John Meldrum was appointed to the University of Edinburgh one year later. We soon met at meetings of the\nEdinburgh Mathematical Society\ngot to know each other well. We both supervised Ph.D. students from early in our careers and had many discussions on this topic. John rightly had high standards, but his gentle, kind approach to supervising students and examining their work was clearly evident. He asked me to be an external examiner for one of his Ph.D. students and, a few years later, he was an external examiner of one of my Ph.D. students. That oral is particularly memorable because of its length. The oral took place in a room with a clock on the wall in front of the examiners; we started at\n11\no'clock. It was an excellent thesis and John enjoyed discussing details with the candidate. After what seemed quite a long time, John looked up at the clock, saw it was\n11\n:\n45\nand said, \"We'll carry on for a little longer.\" After what seemed more than a little while I looked at the clock which still was\n11\n:\n45\n- it had stopped! John, who had a wonderful sense of humour, was quick to joke with the candidate about the quality being so good he had not realised the oral had gone on for over two hours.\nSarwar Abbasi studied for a Ph.D. at the University of Edinburgh in the second half of the\n1980\ns with Meldrum as his advisor. He was awarded a Ph.D. in\n1989\nfor his thesis\nMatrix Near-Rings and Generalized Distributivity\n. He wrote\n[\n7\n]\n:-\nJohn will always remain alive in our hearts and minds. His contributions to mathematics, especially near-ring theory, will keep him alive. He was a role model for me. He was not only a great mathematician but also a very gentle, kind and honest person. I always felt myself a lucky student to have him as my research supervisor. When I joined him in\n1985\nat Edinburgh University, I knew nothing about research in mathematics. He made me able to accomplish my goal and his guidance made me what I am today.\nJohn Meyer, professor at the University of the Free State in South Africa, is one of the authors of\n[\n10\n]\n. He writes\n(\nsee\n[\n7\n]\n)\n:-\nI met John in the early\n1980\ns when he visited Stellenbosch in South Africa. It was during this visit that he and Andries van der Walt coined some new ideas that eventually became the topic of my PhD dissertation. John was therefore instrumental in putting me on the launching pad of my mathematical career. Shortly afterwards, in\n1990\n, I paid him a visit in Edinburgh for a period of four months, a period during which I got to know him and his wife Pat very well. During later years, several further visits followed, in both directions, and we also met at several conferences. I have very fond memories of all these visits. I was especially touched by his kindness, his gentleness, his sense of humour and the way in which he cherished and lived his Christian values. He will be greatly missed not only by the mathematical community with which he closely collaborated, but also by his many friends. In particular, I am filled with gratitude for the lasting positive influence he had on my life. He was a good man.\nMeldrum was a strong supporter of the\nEdinburgh Mathematical Society\nand served as a Secretary from\n1971\nto\n1980\n. He lectured to the Society in session\n1973\n-\n74\n, giving the talk\nNear-rings and groups\n. He was elected as Chairman of the Committee of the British Mathematical Colloquium at the meeting held in the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth, on\n8\nApril\n1976\n. In this capacity he undertook to approach various universities concerning a venue for\n1980\nColloquium; the University of Sheffield was chosen. His main task in his role as Chairman, however, was as one of the two organisers of the British Mathematical Colloquium which was held at the University of Edinburgh in March\n1977\n.\nHe was promoted to Senior Lecturer at the University of Edinburgh in\n1982\nand in\n1996\nhe was promoted to Reader. He retired at the end of July\n2004\n[\n10\n]\n:-\nIn addition to lecturing to undergraduates, John was active in the Department's algebra seminar, was a member of several course committees in the Department, serving as chair of a working party on third-year courses,\n1979\n-\n1980\n, and from\n1993\nuntil his retirement, he was the Departmental Director of Studies. At the Faculty of Science level, he was a member of the Postgraduate Studies Committee from\n1977\nto\n1980\n.\nMeldrum's wife Pat died on\n4\nMay\n2011\n. He continued to undertake research and published the paper\nUnit groups of compatible near-rings and Linz wreath products\nauthored in collaboration with Gary L Peterson from James Madison University in Harrisonburg, Virginia, USA. The paper contains the following acknowledgement:-\nPortions of this paper were developed while the authors were guests at Johannes Kepler Universität in Linz, Austria in June and July of\n2012\nwith the first author\n[\nJohn Meldrum\n]\nsupported by the Austrian Science Fund and the second\n[\nGary Peterson\n]\nby a research fellowship from the University. The authors thank the University for its hospitality and support during this time.\nIf the reader is surprised that a paper on \"Linz wreath products\" was born in Linz, then we should say that it is not a coincidence since the authors chose the name \"Linz wreath product\" because they had the idea while in Linz. Günter Pilz in the review\n[\n16\n]\ncalls the paper a \"marvellous paper\" and a \"masterpiece\". A fitting last paper in an outstanding research career.\nMeldrum' last years were a struggle with Parkinson's disease. He died at\n14\n:\n15\nat Murrayfield House,\n66\nMurrayfield Avenue, Edinburgh on\n9\nAugust\n2018\n. He was cremated at Mortonhall Crematorium, Edinburgh, on\n25\nAugust\n2018\n. The author of\n[\n7\n]\nwrites:-\nJohn Meldrum was a deeply religious man, a committed, active church member, a man of intelligence and integrity, a man who had a profound love for his family. He will be sorely missed but has left many wonderful memories for those who knew him. The world is a better place because of him.\nLet us end this biography with a quote from Suraiya Mahmood given in\n[\n10\n]\n:-\nJohn David Philip Meldrum was my supervisor for my Ph.D. in near-rings at Edinburgh University from\n1976\n-\n1979\n. An inspiring teacher and supervisor, who nurtured his students to not only excel academically but also enabled a holistic sense of well being. As a mother of three young children following a challenging and academically rigorous regimen of study and research, I found him to be always helpful and kind with an intrinsic understanding of the challenges of a young student family. His helpful and understanding nature enabled us to quickly settle into our new environment. Besides our obvious connection on Mathematics we shared a passion for Sports, especially cricket and table tennis. Our research together continued even beyond the completion of my Ph.D. and we participated in many conferences together. The bond formed between both families has continued over the years, with my last meeting with J D P Meldrum a few weeks before his passing away in\n2018\n. He was a guide, a fellow mathematician, a mentor and a lifelong friend, who greatly enriched our lives over a span of\n42\nyears.",
