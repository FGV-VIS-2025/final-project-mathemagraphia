  "biografia": "Marin Mersenne\nwas born into a working class family in the small town of Oizé in the province of Maine on\n8\nSeptember\n1588\nand was baptised on the same day. From an early age he showed signs of devotion and eagerness to study. So, despite their financial situation, Marin's parents sent him to the Collège du Mans where he took grammar classes. Later, at the age of sixteen, Mersenne asked to go to the newly established Jesuit School in La Flèche which had been set up as a model school for the benefit of all children regardless of their parents' financial situation. It turns out that\nDescartes\n, who was eight years younger than Mersenne, was enrolled at the same school although they are not thought to have become friends until much later.\nMersenne's father wanted his son to have a career in the Church. Mersenne, however, was devoted to study, which he loved, and, showing that he was ready for responsibilities of the world, had decided to further his education in Paris. He left for Paris staying en route at a convent of the Minims. This experience so inspired Mersenne that he agreed to join their Order if one day he decided to lead a monastic life. After reaching Paris he studied at the Collège Royale du France, continuing there his education in philosophy and also attending classes in theology at the Sorbonne where he also obtained the degree of Magister Atrium in Philosophy. He finished his studies in\n1611\nand, having had a privileged education, realised that he was now ready for the calm and studious life of a monastery.\nThe Order of the Minims, having been set up by St Francis of Paula in\n1436\n, was thriving at this time. They believed they were the least\n(\nminimi\n)\nof all the religions on earth, and devoted themselves to prayer, study, and scholarship. They wore a habit made of coarse black wool with broad sleeves and girded by a thin black cord\n(\nas seen in the portraits of Mersenne\n)\n. Charles VIII introduced the Order into France and, due to their great simplicity, the monks were named 'les bons hommes'. After the French Revolution the Order dwindled considerably in number and today there exists only a few convents in Italy. Mersenne entered the Order on\n16\nJuly\n1611\n, and was ordained a priest in Paris in July\n1612\nafter a two and a half month probationary period in the monasteries at Nigeon and Meaux. His first posting was in\n1614\nto the monastery in Nevers where he taught philosophy and theology to the younger members of the community. In fact one of his students, Hilarion de Coste, later became his confidant and biographer. It was during this period of his life that he is thought to have discovered the cycloid - a geometric curve.\nAfter two years teaching Mersenne was elected superior of the Place Royale monastery in Paris where he remained, except for brief journeys, until his death in\n1648\n. It is believed that the Church supported him for most of his life, although in later years a fellow monk, Jacques Hallé, helped out with money and granted him access to his library. From the beginning of his time in Paris, mathematical problems played an important role in his life. Very early on he had links with important scholars in Paris whom he met often, exchanging ideas and discussing projects. The Minims realised that the biggest service he could give was through his books and they never asked any more of him.\nIn\n1623\nhe published his first two papers consisting of studies against atheism and scepticism in France;\nL'usage de la raison\nⓉ\n(\nThe use of reason\n)\nand\nL'analyse de la vie spirituelle\nⓉ\n(\nThe analysis of the spiritual life\n)\n. Continuing his theological writing he had then wanted to disprove magic, however a fellow monk pointed out that it was not  appropriate, leading to his publication of\nQuaestiones celeberrime in genesim\nⓉ\n(\nImportant questions on Genesis\n)\nthat includes the disapproval of magicians in the Scriptures. This book contains\n1900\ncolumns of text from the Bible in its first six chapters. It was because of this publication that, in September\n1624\nwhen he returned to Paris, he met\nGassendi\nwho had been asked to comment on Mersenne's results, and later became his closest friend.\nAt this time France was going through a period of anti-witchcraft, expelling any sorcerers.\nL'impiété des deistes\nⓉ\n(\nThe impiety of the deists\n)\n, in French, was aimed at the French public so that they might read and understand what was happening. It was during this time that Mersenne started to think about the theological criticism directed against\nDescartes\nand\nGalileo\n. In fact Mersenne's attitude to\nGalileo\nchanged over a number of years as Garber points out in\n[\n16\n]\n:-\nMarin Mersenne was central to the new mathematical approach to nature in Paris in the\n1630\ns and\n1640\ns. Intellectually, he was one of the most enthusiastic practitioners of that program, and published a number of influential books in those important decades. But Mersenne started his career in a rather different way. In the early\n1620\ns, Mersenne was known in Paris primarily as a writer on religious topics, and a staunch defender of\nAristotle\nagainst attacks by those who would replace him by a new philosophy. ... In the early\n1620\ns, Mersenne listed\nGalileo\namong the innovators in natural philosophy whose views should be rejected. However, by the early\n1630\ns, less than a decade later, Mersenne had become one of\nGalileo\n's most ardent supporters.\nMersenne was beginning to realise that alongside religion it was science that really interested him. Mathematics was the area he studied in greatest depth, believing that without it no science was possible. He always had a philosophical approach to mathematics and believed that the cause of the sciences is the cause of God, see\n[\n5\n]\n. So, in\nLa vérité des sciences\nⓉ\n(\nThe truth of science\n)\nhe proved, via many great discoveries, the value of the human mind. It was around this time that Mersenne started to become a coordinator for all European scholars. From\n1623\nhe began to make a careful selection of savants who met at his convent in Paris or corresponded with him from all across Europe and even from as far afield as Constantinople and Transylvania\n(\npresent-day Romania\n)\n. His regular visitors, or correspondents, included Peiresc,\nGassendi\n,\nDescartes\n,\nRoberval\n, Beeckman, J B van Helmont,\nFermat\n,\nHobbes\n,\nÉtienne Pascal\n, and his son\nBlaise Pascal\n. He set up meetings of scholars from around Europe during which they would read and review scientific papers, both national and international, exchange contacts with other scholars and plan and discuss experiments and other work. This came to be known as the\nAcadémie Parisiensis\nand sometimes among friends as the\nAcadémie Mersenne\n. It was notably one of most resourceful centres of research at that time, meeting weekly at members' houses and later in Mersenne's cell due to his weakened health. The list of Mersenne's correspondents kept increasing and Mersenne himself did not hesitate to travel to meetings with scholars all around Europe.\nMersenne had a strong interest in music and spent a lot of time researching acoustics and the speed of sound. In\n1627\nhe published one of his most famous works,\nL'harmonie universelle\nⓉ\n(\nThe universal harmony\n)\n. In this work he was the first to publish the laws relating to the vibrating string: its frequency is proportional to the square root of the tension, and inversely proportional to the length, to the diameter and to the square root of the specific weight of the string, provided all other conditions remain the same when one of these quantities is altered. Mersenne had already started encouraging the talents of others and helped them to share their ideas and results with other scholars. When\nRoberval\narrived in Paris, after joining Mersenne's circle of scholars, his talent was soon recognised by Mersenne who encouraged him to work on the cycloid.\nThe period between\n1627\nand\n1634\nwas a transitional period in Mersenne's life. During this time he travelled to Holland for several months between\n1629\nand\n1630\n. His main reason was to seek a cure for an illness with the help of spa water but he used the opportunity to visit scholars in the surrounding areas. The greater maturity in his writing in the seven years since his last publication became apparent when\nQuestions inouyes\nⓉ\n(\nUnanswered questions\n)\nand\nQuestions harmoniques\nⓉ\n(\nHarmonic Issues\n)\nwere printed in\n1634\n. In October\n1644\nMersenne travelled to Provence and Italy where he learnt of the barometer experiment from\nTorricelli\n. On his return to Paris, he reported this news to encourage French scholars to carry out the experiments too.\nThroughout his lifetime Mersenne helped many potential scientists by steering them in the right direction and advising some on the next step to take. He became a role model for\nHuygens\nwhom Mersenne took under his wing and through his encouraging letters inspired\nHuygens\n'\nTheory of Music\n.\nHuygens\nhad intended to move to Paris in\n1646\nto be near Mersenne in order to enable them to contact each other more easily, however\nHuygens\ndid not move until several years after Mersenne had died so they never met.\nGalileo\nalso has to be grateful to Mersenne for making his work known outside Italy. Mersenne insisted on publishing\nGalileo\n's work and without this\nGalileo\n's ideas might never have become as widely known. Continuing his travels into his old age, in\n1646\nMersenne set off on a trip to Bordeaux. There he met Pierre Trichet whom he helped make his mark. The success of the scientific life over in Bordeaux and Guyenne, which later formed the\nAcadémie Royale des Sciences\n, was largely due to the advice and experience Mersenne was able to offer. He returned to Paris in\n1647\n.\nMersenne fell ill after his visit to see\nDescartes\nin July\n1648\nand, unfortunately, his health never improved. He was advised to mix wine with his water to help him get better, however Minims do not drink wine. He had an abscess on the lung but the surgeon was unable to find it. Mersenne himself pointed out that the incision, which he asked for, had been attempted too low.\nGassendi\nwas there for Mersenne throughout his illness and remained with him until his death on\n1\nSeptember\n1648\nin Paris, just\n8\ndays from his\n60\nth\nbirthday. He never gave up his life-long desire to advance science. He even asked, in his will, that his body be used for biological research.\nAfter Mersenne's death, letters in his cell were found from\n78\ndifferent correspondents including\nFermat\n,\nHuygens\n,\nPell\n,\nGalileo\nand\nTorricelli\n. Also several physics instruments were found in his cell and a lot of Mersenne's library was retrieved from which\nL'optique et la catoptrique\nⓉ\n(\nOptics and catoptrics\n)\nwas published in\n1651\n. Inside this publication one of\nRoberval\n's texts was inserted. Later all the letters he sent and received from other scholars were accumulated and published in several volumes. These letters read like an international review of mechanics in the early\n17\nth\ncentury. Mersenne was aware of all the science that was going on, what all the scientists were doing, and only wanted for them all to work together in advancing science.\nMersenne studied the cycloid for several years quoting his research in\nQuaestiones in Genesim\nⓉ\n(\nQuestions on Genesis\n)\n(1623)\n,\nSynopsis mathematica\nⓉ\n(\nMathematical summary\n)\n(1626)\nand\nQuestions inouyes\nⓉ\n(\nUnbelievable questions\n)\n(1634)\n. He gave the definition of a cycloid as the locus of a point at distance\nh\nfrom the centre of a circle of radius\na\na\na\n, that rolls along a straight line.  He stated the obvious properties including the length of the base line equals the circumference of the rolling circle. We note that Mersenne referred to the cycloid as the 'roulette' but the term cycloid was adopted later.  He attempted to find the area under the curve by integration but having failed, so he put the question to\nRoberval\n. In\n1638\nhe announced that\nRoberval\nhad indeed found the area under the cycloid.\nMersenne's name is best remembered today for Mersenne\nprimes\n. He tried to find a formula that would represent all primes but, although he failed in this, his work on numbers of the form\n2\np\n−\n1\n2^{p} - 1\n2\np\n−\n1\n,\np\np\np\nprime\nhas been of continuing interest in the investigation of large primes. It is easy to prove that if the number\nn\n=\n2\np\n−\n1\nn = 2^{p} - 1\nn\n=\n2\np\n−\n1\nis prime then\np\np\np\nmust be a prime. In\n1644\nMersenne claimed that\nn\nn\nn\nis prime if\np\np\np\n=\n2\n,\n3\n,\n5\n,\n7\n,\n13\n,\n17\n,\n19\n,\n31\n,\n67\n,\n127\nand\n257\nbut\ncomposite\nfor the other\n44\nprimes\np\np\np\nsmaller than\n257\n.\nOver the years it has been found that Mersenne was wrong about\n5\nof the primes of the form\n2\np\n−\n1\n2^{p} - 1\n2\np\n−\n1\nwhere\np\np\np\nis less than or equal to\n257\n(\nhe claimed two that did not lead to a prime\n(67\nand\n257)\nand missed\n3\nthat did:\n61\n,\n89\n,\n107)\n. Drake\n[\n13\n]\nhas tried to both understand the source of Mersenne's work on these primes, and also to try to determine the rule that was being used. He suggests\nFrenicle de Bessy\nmay be the source and also suggests that the errors might be misprints by the printer. Drake reconstructs Mersenne's rule for exponents as that they must differ by not more than one from a value of\n2\nn\n2^{n}\n2\nn\nor by not more than three from a value of\n2\nto the power\n2\nn\n2^{n}\n2\nn\n.\nMersenne undertook experiments to test\nGalileo\n's law of motion for falling bodies. In\n1634\nhe presented the results that he had obtained when measuring the acceleration of falling bodies from heights of\n147\n,\n108\nand\n48\nfeet. These confirmed the time-squared law that\nGalileo\nhad published in his\nDialogue on the two chief world systems\nof\n1632\nbut they also raised questions about the numerical data. One problem he tried to solve was whether acceleration was continuous as\nGalileo\nmaintained or discontinuous as\nDescartes\nbelieved. Mersenne thought\nGalileo\n's assumption that a falling body passes through infinite degrees of speed was incompatible with a genuinely mechanistic explanation of acceleration. These ideas are discussed in detail in\n[\n24\n]\nand\n[\n25\n]\n.\nIn some of his non-mathematical works Mersenne looks at permutations and combinations. He states practical rules for calculating the number of combinations or permutations, solving the problem of finding the number of permutations with or without repetitions and gives an example the making of anagrams. His main reason to study combinatorial analysis was, however, to optimise musical composition as he explains in\nThe book on the art of singing well\nwhich is Book Six of\nHarmonie universelle\nⓉ\n(\nUniversal harmony\n)\n(1636)\n. In an unpublished manuscript preserved in the Bibliothèque Nationale at Paris he gave the\n40320\npermutations of\n8\nnotes.\nDuring the final four years of his life, Mersenne spent a lot of time investigating the barometer.\nPascal\nhad already proved that air was not weightless and it was Mersenne who found the density of air to be approximately\n1\n19\n\\large\\frac{1}{19}\\normalsize\n1\n9\n1\n​\nth\nthat of water.   He was informed of the barometer experiment, consisting of a glass tube about\n3\nfeet long sealed at one end and filled with pure mercury, through several letters from De Verdus but it was not until October\n1644\n, when he visited\nTorricelli\nin Italy, that he saw the experiment carried out.\nTorricelli\nused the pressure of the air to explain why the mercury moved up the glass tube.  Mersenne was doubtful that the air pressure actually supported the mercury and on his return attempted to re-do the experiment but did not have the necessary equipment.  Mersenne explained the problem to\nÉtienne Pascal\n, his son\nBlaise Pascal\n,\nPetit\n,\nRoberval\n, and others in Paris. There is some confusion as to who, in\n1647\n, initially suggested the experiments with the Torricellian tube and the mountain, later to be called the Puy de Dome experiments. Certainly Mersenne had briefed both\nHuygens\nand\nLe Tenneur\nbut it was not until three weeks after Mersenne's death in\n1648\nthat these experiments were carried out.  They consisted of collecting results both at the foot of the Puy de Dome and at the summit.  Tests were made as to whether the level of mercury in the column was lower when at the top of the mountain than it was at the bottom.  If this had proved to be true, they realised that this would be due to the pressure of the air alone.  Perier, who finally conducted the experiments, did indeed find that there was a significant difference in the level of the mercury hence drawing the correct conclusion that the air pressure was supporting it.\nAn interesting question is how Mersenne managed to pursue his scientific ideas freely at a time when the Church\n(\nof which he was a devoted member\n)\nmoved to prevent such discussion. This topic is considered in detail in\n[\n18\n]\nwhere Hine writes:-\nDuring the first half of the seventeenth century, debate over the Copernican hypothesis had spread beyond the ranks of astronomers and had stirred up so much controversy that the Church decided to intervene. In\n1616\na theological examining body concluded that the idea of the earth's motion was philosophically false and in conflict with the Scriptures, and it suspended\nCopernicus\n's book until corrected. Historians have generally assumed that this decision and the subsequent condemnation of\nGalileo\nhad such a devastating effect that scientific progress in Catholic countries was greatly retarded. However, the attitude of Mersenne, who was both a faithful member of a religious order and a central figure in the development of French science, does not support such a conclusion. An examination of Mersenne's reaction to Copernicanism indicates that no matter how disturbing the Church's decision, it was still possible, at least in France, to study Copernican ideas and to find them useful, despite some reservations. Mersenne was affected by such decisions of the Church, but less so than one might suppose.",
