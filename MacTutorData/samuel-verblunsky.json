  "biografia": "Samuel Verblunsky\n's parents were Elcono Verblunsky, born in Russia in\n1874\n, and Leah Foner, born in Russia in\n1880\n. We note that some sources give Poland as the country of birth of both Elcono Verblunsky and Leah Foner but they themselves give Russia on their census forms. A probable explanation is that since Poland did not exist as an independent country at the time of their birth, being partitioned between Russia, Prussia, and Austria, they were born in that part of Poland belonging to Russia. Elcono Verblunsky, who in the early\n1900\ns was living at\n121\nHanbury Street, Mile End New Town, London, became a naturalised British citizen on\n7\nAugust\n1903\n. He was a tailor who had married Leah Foner in December\n1901\nat Whitechapel, London.\nVerblunsky's school education was in London and he entered Magdalene College, Cambridge in\n1924\nhaving won a scholarship to study mathematics. Fellow mathematics students at Cambridge included\nDonald Coxeter\n,\nRaymond Paley\n, Archibald J Macintyre and James Cossar. His tutor at Magdalene College was Arthur Stanley Ramsey\n(1867\n-\n1954)\n, who was president of the College and the father of the brilliant mathematical logician\nFrank Ramsey\n. Verblunsky was taught by\nG H Hardy\nand\nJ E Littlewood\nand was ranked First Class in both parts of the Mathematical Tripos. After the award of his B.A. in\n1927\nhe continued to undertake research at Magdalene College with\nJ E Littlewood\nas his thesis advisor and was awarded his doctorate in\n1930\nfor his thesis\nResearches In The Theory Of Fourier Series\n.\nBefore the award of his doctorate, Verblunsky began to publish a remarkable high volume of papers. The\n1930\nMathematical Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society\ncontains eight papers by Verblunsky, namely:\nA property of continuous arcs\n(\nsubmitted May\n1929)\n,\nThe relation between Riemann's method of summation and Ces√†ro's\n(\nsubmitted May\n1929)\n,\nNote on the sum of an oscillating serie\ns\n(\nsubmitted October\n1929)\n,\nNote on the Gibbs Phenomenon\n(\nsubmitted November\n1929)\n,\nThe convergence of singular integrals\n(\nsubmitted February\n1930)\n,\nNote on the modified Heine-Borel theorem\n(\nsubmitted April\n1930)\n,\nA property of continuous arcs II\n(\nsubmitted July\n1930)\n, and\nNote on the sum of an oscillating serie\ns\nII\n(\nsubmitted July\n1930)\n. These papers were all published before he was awarded a Ph.D. With eight papers appearing in these\nProceedings\nin\n1930\none might believe that this was the only journal in which Verblunsky published at this time. However, he was also submitting papers to the\nLondon Mathematical Society\n. The papers\nOn Summable Trigonometric Series\n(\nsubmitted September\n1929)\nand\nThe Generalized Third Derivative and its Application to the Theory of Trigonometric Series\n(\nsubmitted September\n1929)\nwere both published in the\nProceedings\nof the\nLondon Mathematical Society\nin\n1930\n. His paper\nOn the Limit of a Function at a Point\n, which he submitted to the\nLondon Mathematical Society\nin December\n1929\n, appeared in the\nProceedings\nin\n1931\n. Among the results that Verblunsky proved in his early papers was that a trigonometric series cannot be summable\n(\nC\n,\n1\n)\n(C, 1)\n(\nC\n,\n1\n)\nto\n0\nunless its coefficients are nul, thus confirming a\n1911\nconjecture of\nMarcel Riesz\n.\nAfter the award of a Ph.D. from the University of Cambridge, Verblunsky remained at Cambridge being elected as a fellow of Magdalene College. Ronald Hyam writes\n[\n5\n]\n:-\nAt the time of his election, it emerged that he had never used a telephone and never been in a taxi, evidence of a modest life style which one older don thought 'unpropitious'.\nThe\nMathematical Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society\nof\n1931\ncontains four Verblunsky papers, namely\nNote on Continuous Functionals\n(\nsubmitted June\n1930)\n,\nThe symmetric derivative and its application to the theory of trigonometric series\n(\nsubmitted October\n1930)\n,\nOn summable trigonometric integrals\n(\nsubmitted November\n1930)\n, and\nNote on the Gibbs Phenomenon II\n(\nsubmitted May\n1931)\n. At this point Verblunsky stopped publishing in the\nMathematical Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society\nand over the following few years the\nProceedings\ndoes not contain any of his papers. He next submitted a paper to these\nProceedings\nin May\n1935\n, this being\nOn Positive Harmonic Functions in a Half-Plane\n(1935)\n. From\n1931\nonwards, however, numerous papers by Verblunsky were published by the\nLondon Mathematical Society\n.\nAt some stage Verblunsky left Cambridge when he was appointed as a lecturer at the University of Manchester. We do not know the exact date on which he took up his post in Manchester but one of his\n1933\npapers has the University of Manchester address although some later papers still have the Magdalene College address. He remained in Manchester until\n1939\nand during these years he wrote two papers which are his most quoted today. These two papers, published in\n1935\nand\n1936\n, were based on presentations he made to the\nLondon Mathematical Society\nin\n1933\nand\n1935\n. The first was\nOn positive harmonic functions. A contribution to the algebra of Fourier series\nwhile the second, which contains a proof of what today is called Verblunsky's Theorem, was\nOn positive harmonic functions\n. Barry Simon writes\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nI got hold of\n[\nthese two papers\n]\nand read them with fascination. It was hard going, but as I absorbed the papers, it became clear that there was an enormous number of ideas in these papers that had become important, but then forgotten and later rediscovered! So added to the agenda was making sure Verblunsky got the credit so long denied him!\nVerblunsky published the textbook\nAn introduction to the Theory of Functions of a Real Variable\nin\n1939\n. P T Daniel, reviewing this\n169\n-page book, writes\n[\n3\n]\n:-\nThis is a very good book and one which fills a long-felt need. It is scarcely necessary to say that it is a book with a conscience. The author is meticulous in all his proofs and statements and it is a pleasure to read a comparatively elementary account of the subject feeling that the author knows better than his reviewer. But there is, in addition, real artistry in designing the structure so that each theorem comes where it pulls its weight with greatest effect. The crisp style used might well be copied by other authors. Certain points are unusual and specially to be praised for neatness. ... The book is particularly suitable for the young mathematician at the University. For those at school it is too advanced, taken as a whole, except for the few. But school teachers could profitably pick out parts of it for presentation to replace proofs now fashionable. What is more important,, these teachers could be inspired by the book to treat more elementary questions; in a similar though necessarily modified way. The book would not only give aesthetic pleasure but even some instruction to University teachers.\nAnother reviewer, G Baley Price, writes\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nThis text for students and teachers was written for the special purpose of furnishing a more rigorous and accurate treatment of the elements of the theory of functions of a real variable. It is based on notes of lectures delivered by Verblunsky to students in their first year at the University of Manchester. The subject matter is entirely standard, but the treatment involves much that is new and original - ingenious and elegant proofs for certain theorems and new approaches to some parts of the subject. The dominant feature of the book is the presentation of the subject as a body of deductions from specified hypotheses. ... To this reviewer it seems that Verblunsky has succeeded admirably in his effort to write a rigorous and accurate introduction to the theory of functions of a real variable. Furthermore, the literature has been enriched permanently by original treatments of certain topics and the elegant proofs of numerous theorems which he has contributed. At the same time, the book has certain characteristics which this reviewer finds unfortunate in a text for beginners. ... The author and printer are to be congratulated on producing an excellent mathematical text.\nIn\n1939\n, the year his book was published, Verblunsky was appointed as a Professor of Mathematics at Queen's University, Belfast. He remained there for the rest of his career. He joined the\nAmerican Mathematical Society\nin\n1952\nat a time when he had Joseph L Smyrl as a research student. Smyrl was awarded a Ph.D. in\n1953\nfor his thesis\nSome Studies in Trigonometrical Ratios\nand he published the paper\nUniqueness theorems for a class of generalized trigonometrical series\nin\n1954\nin which he wrote:-\nI am indebted to Professor S Verblunsky, under whose supervision this work was carried out, for his helpful criticism and advice.\nAnother two of Verblunsky's Ph.D. students, Johnston Andrew Anderson and Gordon Harper Fullerton, wrote the joint paper\nOn a class of Cauchy exponential series\n(1965)\nin which they write:-\n... the authors wish to express their gratitude to Professor S Verblunsky of Belfast, for his helpful criticism and advice.\nAfter he retired from his chair at Queen's University, Belfast, Verblunsky moved away from the city but remained living in Northern Ireland. He never married and when he died in\n1996\nat the age of\n90\nhe left a bequest to the\nLondon Mathematical Society\nto create a reading room in his name. The Verblunsky Room is in\nDe Morgan\nHouse, Russell Square, London and at present it is a Members' Room housing the\nLondon Mathematical Society\n's special collections consisting of the\nHardy\nCollection and the\nPhilippa Fawcett\nCollection.\nFinally, let us note that MathSciNet lists\n17\npapers with 'Verblunsky coefficients' in the title and another\n73\nwith this term in the review text. All of these papers have been published since the publication of Barry Simon's book\n[\n1\n]\nin\n2004\n. It also lists\n10\npapers with 'Verblunsky parameters' in the review text, all published since\n2007\n.",
