  "summary": "Emory McClintock was an American mathematician and actuary.",
  "biografia": "Emory McClintock\nsoon dropped his first name of \"John\"\n(\nto avoid confusion with his father who was known as John McClintock\n)\nand was known by his middle name of \"Emory\". His mother was Caroline Augusta Wakeman and his father was the Reverend John McClintock. As well as being a clergyman in the Methodist Episcopal Church, the Reverend McClintock taught mathematics, Greek, and Latin at Dickinson College, Carlisle, Pennsylvania.\nUp to the age of thirteen, Emory was taught at home, then he spent only one year at high school before entering the College where his father taught. He studied at Dickinson College from\n1854\nuntil he entered Yale University in\n1856\n. The move to Yale took place because his father moved north at this time and Emory went with him. He then studied at Columbia College in New York\n(\nlater Columbia University\n)\nfrom\n1857\nreceiving his A.B. in\n1859\n. In the following academic year,\n1859\n-\n60\n, he taught mathematics at Columbia College as a tutor before deciding to continue his studies in Europe.\nMcClintock spent the latter part of\n1860\nstudying chemistry at the University of Paris and then in the following year he studied at GÃ¶ttingen. Much had happen in American politics during the time that McClintock had been in Europe. In\n1860\nLincoln was elected President and this acted as a signal for secession. First was South Carolina on\n20\nDecember and other southern states followed. In February\n1861\n, before Lincoln's inauguration, six states set up a government in the south. By April\n1861\nthe civil war had broken out and by February\n1862\nMcClintock felt that he had to return to support his country. By the time McClintock returned to the United States the South had already introduced conscription and the Union was encouraging volunteers for military service although they had not yet introduced conscription. McClintock immediately decided to volunteer for the Union army and was offered a post as a second lieutenant in the Topographical Engineers. Before he could take up the post, however, he suffered severe sunstroke which prevented him from joining the army. He slowly recovered his health over quite a long period.\nHe represented the US Consul in England from\n1863\nto\n1866\nwhen he became associated with a banking firm in Paris during\n1867\n. Returning to the United States he became an actuary for the Asbury Life Insurance Company in New York in\n1867\n, putting his mathematical skills to good use. McClintock married Zoe Darlington, daughter of John Darlington from Yorkshire, England, on\n22\nJanuary\n1868\n; they had one son, John, born in\n1872\n, who went on to a prominent career in the United States military. He moved to a position in the Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company of Milwaukee in\n1871\n, before becoming an actuary in the Mutual Life Insurance Company in New York in\n1889\n. He became vice-president of the Company in\n1906\nand held this post until he retired in\n1911\n. After he retired he still acted as a consulting actuary until\n1916\n.\nIn fact McClintock was for many years the leading actuary in America. He published\n30\npapers between\n1868\nand\n1877\non actuarial questions. His publications were not confined to questions relating to life insurance policies however. He published about\n22\npapers on mathematical topics. One paper treats\ndifference equations\nas\ndifferential equations\nof infinite order and others look at\nquintic equations\nwhich are\nsoluble algebraically\n. He published\nA simplified solution of the cubic\nin\n1900\nin the\nAnnals of Mathematics\n. Another work,\nOn the nature and use of the functions employed in the recognition of quadratic residues\n(1902)\n, published in the\nTransactions of the American Mathematical Society\n, is on\nquadratic residues\n.\nArchibald writes\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nMcClintock is known to have expressed regret that he had not followed an academic career, which would have permitted him to give a large share of his time to research... In such a direction he would probably have gone far.\nIn\n1889\nwhen McClintock took up his actuarial post with the Mutual Life Insurance Company in New York, the\nNew York Mathematical Society\nwas just coming into existence. McClintock joined the Society in December\n1889\nand was elected vice-president of the Society. In the following year he was elected president and he has the distinction of being the only president of the Society to serve for four years.\nDuring McClintock's presidential term,\nKlein\nvisited the Society and talked on\nnon-euclidean\nspherical trigonometry.\nStudy\nalso addressed the Society during McClintock's term as president and talked on his work with\nEngel\n. When McClintock's term ended he gave the first presidential address to the Society on\nThe past and future of the Society\n[\n7\n]\n:-\n... he was a great help in establishing the Bulletin of the\nAmerican Mathematical Society\nand the Transactions of the American Mathematical Society; contemporary accounts have suggested that his role was not limited to merely advice but also extended to financial assistance ... It is known that he made substantial donations to the Society's library.\nAmong the honours which McClintock received, many were for his mathematical work on the Calculus of Enlargement\n[\n7\n]\n:-\n... in his \"An Essay on the Calculus of Enlargement\"\n(1879)\n... he sought to develop a unified theory of the calculus of finite differences and the differential calculus. This led he to restate difference equations as differential equations of infinite order.\nFor this work he received honorary degrees, including a Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin\n(1884)\nand LL.D. degrees from Yale\n(1892)\nand Columbia\n(1895)\n.\nBefore ending this biography we should mention McClintock's hobbies of genealogy and military history. McClintock:-\n... was able to trace his family back through several centuries. A series of notebooks reflecting specific research into the Baskerville, Kemble, McClintock, and Wakeman families record the lines of descent through each ancestral surname. Several folders of handwritten notes for various family surnames, including Goodyear, Longacre, Lowry, and Ward, are arranged alphabetically by surname ...\nHis researches into the American Revolutionary War and George Washington led him to address the Washington Association of New Jersey. On his death he left an unfinished manuscript\nThe Fall of\n1779\nconcerning his research into the life of George Washington.\nAfter the death of his first wife Zoe, McClintock married Isabella Bishop, daughter of the Honourable James Bishop, of New Brunswick, New Jersey.",
