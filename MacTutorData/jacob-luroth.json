  "biografia": "Jacob Lüroth\n's names appear as 'Jacob' or Jakob' and as 'Lüroth' or 'Lueroth'. His father, also named Jacob Lüroth\n(1792\n-\n1860)\n, was a brewer and a member of the local town council. However, his father died when Jacob was sixteen years old and after that time he was brought up by his mother, Katharina Voisin, who did her utmost to give her son a good education despite financial difficulties. Jacob attended the Lyceum in Mannheim where he showed himself to be a gifted linguist. He used his linguistic skills later in life in translating texts from English and Italian into German. However, at high school he also enjoyed mathematics and astronomy, studying these with the help of his mathematics teacher Carl Rapp. In\n1859\nthe astronomer Eduard Schönfeld\n(1828\n-\n1891)\nwas appointed to the observatory in Mannheim and he encouraged interested school pupils to take part in astronomical activities. Lüroth took part in observing and was given much encouragement by Schönfeld. He was often in Schönfeld's home and Schönfeld acted as a patron, advisor and friend to the young man. His first publication\nElemente der Melete\nⓉ\n(\nCalculations of the asteroid Melete\n)\nwas a joint work with his teacher Carl Rapp in which they calculated an orbit from three observations made by Eduard Schönfeld in January\n1862\n.\nIn the autumn of\n1862\n, Lüroth passed the matriculation examination for the University of Bonn and he began to study astronomy with Friedrich Wilhelm Argelander\n(1799\n-\n1875)\n. Argelander had been a student of Wilhelm Bessel, who had set up an observatory which had begun operating in Bonn in\n1845\n. He had worked on a star catalogue in collaboration with Eduard Schönfeld who had advised Lüroth that Bonn was an excellent place to study astronomy. Lüroth began to make astronomical observations but he soon realised that his poor eyesight was not going to give him a future in that subject so his interest turned to mathematics. He had already published a number of works in astronomy in addition to the paper mentioned above, namely\nEphemeride der Calypso\nⓉ\n(\nEphemerides for Calypso\n[\nan asteroid\n]\n)\n(1862)\nDrei Ringmikrometer-Beobachtungen der Urania am\n5\n-füssigen Fraunhofer\nⓉ\n(\nThree ring micrometer observations of Urania\n[\nan asteroid\n]\non a\n5\n-foot Fraunhofer\n[\ntelescope\n]\n)\n(1862)\nand\nFünf ebensolche Beobachtungen der Asträa\nⓉ\n(\nFive just such observations of Astraea\n[\nan asteroid\n]\n)\n(1863)\n. Having to give up his ambition to study astronomy was certainly not an easy one for the young man and in later life he described this as one of the most painful disappointments of his life.\nHe studied mathematics at a number of universities as was the usual practice of German students at that time. Between the years\n1863\nand\n1865\nhe was a student at the University of Heidelberg where he attended lectures by\nOtto Hesse\nand\nGustav Kirchhoff\nand was advised by them on topics for research. He received a doctorate in\n1865\nfor a thesis\nZur Theorie des Pascalschen Sechsecks\nⓉ\n(\nTheory of Pascal's hexagon\n)\non the\nPascal\nconfiguration. After graduating from Heidelberg, Lüroth went to Berlin where he spent\n1865\n-\n66\nattending lectures at the University from several leading mathematicians including\nKarl Weierstrass\n. In\n1866\nhe went to the University of Giessen where he was strongly influenced by\nAlfred Clebsch\n. Now\nClebsch\nhad arrived in Giessen in\n1863\nand at that time had changed his research topic from applied mathematics to pure mathematics. He had collaborated with\nPaul Gordan\nat Giessen on the theory of abelian functions and their joint monograph on that topic was published around the time Lüroth arrived in Giessen. It was working with\nClebsch\nin Giessen that directed Lüroth's research towards geometry and function theory.\nLüroth\nhabilitated\nat the University of Heidelberg in the summer of\n1867\nafter submitting the thesis\nZur Theorie der windschiefen Flächen\nⓉ\n(\nOn the theory of wind-swept surfaces\n)\nand he was appointed to the teaching staff. He taught there for a year before being appointed to the Technische Hochschule in Karlsruhe in\n1868\n. Joseph Dienger\n(1818\n-\n1894)\nhad been a secondary school teacher before being appointed to the Technische Hochschule in Karlsruhe in\n1850\n. He worked there until\n1868\nand initially Lüroth was appointed to help Dienger out but, after Dienger left, he became a candidate to fill the vacant professorship and in January\n1869\nhe was appointed as a full professor of mathematics at the Technische Hochschule in Karlsruhe. He was only\n25\nyears old at the time, remarkably young to receive such a prestigious appointment, but he had impressed the appointing panel with his outstanding teaching ability and his likeably personality. Lüroth married Karoline Antonie Schepp\n(1850\n-\n1920)\n(\nknown as Antonie\n)\nin\n1875\nand their only child, a daughter Emilie, was born in Karlsruhe in\n1876\n. Antonie was the sister of Lieutenant Adolf Schepp\n(1837\n-\n1905)\nwho collaborated with Lüroth on translations of English and Italian mathematical texts into German. In the year that his daughter was born, Lüroth was director of the Technische Hochschule in Karlsruhe, a position he held in\n1876\n-\n77\n. Lüroth spent twelve years at Karlsruhe, then in\n1880\nhe moved to Munich, teaching at the Technische Hochschule there for three years. In\n1883\nLüroth moved again, this time being appointed to the University of Freiburg. He was to spend the rest of his career in Freiburg im Breisgau. He was vice-rector of the university in\n1889\n-\n90\n.\nThe authors of\n[\n2\n]\nwrite about his abilities:-\nFrom his youth he was distinguished by the ability to grasp new ideas quickly and clearly, and to recognize which are important. Because he had a remarkable memory, Lüroth was effortlessly at home in almost all areas of mathematics, including applied mathematics, many branches of astronomy, geodesy and even more remote areas of knowledge. ... It was the treatises that were most difficult to understand that attracted him the most. From out of this capacity, which he maintained throughout his life, his actual productive activity has been developed, which stretches, with rare versatility, to geometry and mechanics, to astronomy and geodesy, to probability theory, set theory and the logical foundations of mathematics, on function theory and algebra.\nAs we have mentioned above, Lüroth was taught by\nHesse\nand\nClebsch\nand because of their influence he continued to develop their work on geometry and\ninvariants\n. He published results in the areas of analytic geometry, linear geometry and continued the directions of his teachers in his publications on invariant theory. In\n1869\nLüroth discovered the \"Lüroth quartic\" and it appears in his paper\nEinige Eigenschaften einer gewissen Gattung von Kurven vierter Ordnung\nⓉ\n(\nSome properties of a certain class of fourth-order curves\n)\nwhich was published in the first volume of\nMathematische Annalen\nin\n1869\n. The Lüroth quartic is a nonsingular quartic plane curve which contains the ten vertices of a complete pentalateral. Lüroth's work on this curve came out of an investigation he was carrying out into when a ternary quartic form could be represented as the sum of five fourth powers of linear forms.\nSome of his work on rational curves, in particular his contributions in the paper\nBeweis eines Satzes über rationale Kurven\npublished in\nMathematische Annalen\nin\n1876\n, was extended to surfaces by\nGuido Castelnuovo\nin\n1895\n. In\n1883\nLüroth published his method on constructing a\nRiemann\nsurface for a given algebraic curve. Lüroth also worked on the big problem of the topological invariance of dimension. Albert C Lewis, reviewing\n[\n4\n]\n, writes:-\nAfter\nCantor\n's discovery, published early in\n1878\n, of the \"paradox\" of the one-to-one correspondence of the unit square with the unit line segment, \"the next problem\" was \"the invariance of dimension through a consideration of continuity\", which\nDedekind\nhad formulated in a letter to\nCantor\n. Jacob Lüroth,\nJohannes Thomae\n, Enno Jürgens,\nEugen Netto\n, as well as\nCantor\nhimself, addressed this problem .... Lüroth assumed a one-to-one correspondence between two coordinate manifolds of different dimension and arrived at a contradiction but only for certain special cases of particular choices of dimension.\nAlthough Lüroth made some useful progress, this difficult problem was not completely solved until the work of\nL E J Brouwer\nin\n1911\n.\nAmong his other work, Lüroth undertook editing. He was an editor of the complete works of\nLudwig Otto Hesse\n(\npublished in\n1897)\nand of\nHermann Grassmann\n(\npublished in\n1893\nand\n1902)\n. We mentioned above that he collaborated with his brother-in-law, Adolf Schepp, in translating texts from English and Italian into German. Their most famous translation was of\nUlisse Dini\n's\n1878\ntreatise which they published under the title\nGrundlagen für eine Theorie der Funktionen einer veränderlichen reellen Grösse\nⓉ\n(\nFoundations of a theory of functions of a real variable\n)\n(1892)\n. He also has some fine results on logic, a topic he worked on in collaboration with his friend\nErnst Schröder\n.\nKarl von Staudt\n's ideas of geometry interested Lüroth and he further developed\nvon Staudt\n's complex geometry in papers such as\nÜber das Rechnen mit Würfen\nⓉ\n(\nOn calculating with throws\n)\n(1873)\nand\nDas Imaginäre in der Geometrie und das Rechnen mit Würfen. Darstellung und Erweiterung der v. Staudt'schen Theorie\nⓉ\n(\nThe imaginary in geometry and calculating with throws. Representation and expansion of von Staudt's theory\n)\n(1875)\n. He also wrote two important books. He published the first of these,\nGrundriss der Mechanik\nⓉ\n(\nA plan of mechanics\n)\n, in\n1881\n. This mechanics book makes heavy use of the vector calculus, being the first one to do so. A second book,\nVorlesungen über numerisches Rechnen\nⓉ\n(\nLectures on numerical computing\n)\n, was published in\n1900\n.\nAnother of his contributions, for which he has failed to be given the credit that he deserves, was his discovery of the\nt\nt\nt\n-distribution in\n1876\n. The estimation of the parameters of the normal distribution by inverse probability had been treated by\nCarl Friedrich Gauss\n. Lüroth carried on with\nGauss\n's analysis of the linear normal model by considering the joint distribution of the parameters. He published his work on the t-distribution in\nVergleichung von zwei Werten des wahrscheinlichen Fehlers\nⓉ\n(\nComparison of two values of the probable error\n)\n(1876)\n. This statistical test was rediscovered by\nWilliam Gosset\n, who coincidently was born in the year that Lüroth made his discovery, and its discovery is now attributed to\nGosset\nwho published it under the name 'Student' in\n1908\n.\nLüroth received many honours for his contributions. For example, he was elected to the Royal Bavarian Academy of Sciences in\n1882\n, elected to the\nGerman Academy of Scientists Leopoldina\nin\n1883\n, and elected to the\nHeidelberg Academy of Sciences\n1909\n.\nLüroth continued to work at Freiburg despite his health deteriorating due to heart problems. He showed remarkable courage and, despite being in severe pain, tried to appear cheerful to all those round him. Eventually he was forced to stop work and, with his wife and daughter, he went to Munich where he hoped to recover. However, he died in Munich following a heart attack.\nAlexander von Brill\nand\nMax Noether\ngive this final tribute\n[\n2\n]\n:-\nLüroth most carefully maintained and preserved with unswerving loyalty an intercourse with his friends at all times. Absolutely reliable,  he could show towards them a spirit of sacrifice, which went far beyond the expected level. What efforts Lüroth has spent on encouraging an appreciation of the work of his late friend,\nErnst Schröder\nwho, for a long time, stood alone with his efforts to introduce a conceptual notation in Germany. And to\nJulius Weingarten\n, who was still brought in his final years to Freiburg im Breisgau, where a position as visiting professor, was given at the university essentially due to Lüroth, which gave the lonely scholar in his last years a desired sphere.",
