  "biografia": "Georg Kreisel\ncame from a Jewish background so growing up in Graz in the\n1930\ns was very difficult. Kreisel's parents saw the approaching political problems and, before Hitler took over Austria, they sent Georg and his brother to England. Kreisel studied mathematics at Trinity College, Cambridge graduating with a B.A. in\n1944\n. During his undergraduate years Kreisel was influenced by\nWittgenstein\nwho was also at Trinity.\nWittgenstein\nsaid that Kreisel was:-\n... the most able philosopher he had ever met who was also a mathematician.\nKreisel was sent to do War Service with the Admiralty immediately his university courses were over and he began work at West Leigh near Havant and close to the naval base at Portsmouth. The head of West Leigh at that time was\nCollingwood\n. After a while, Kreisel was moved to Fanum House in central London where he studied the effects of waves on the harbours which were being designed for the Normandy landings.\nIn\n1946\nKreisel returned to Cambridge to undertake research, studying mathematical logic. After the award of his doctorate Kreisel hoped for a Fellowship at Trinity but this was not forthcoming. He applied for academic positions and was appointed to Reading in\n1949\n.\nFreeman Dyson\nwas an undergraduate at Cambridge in the same year as Kreisel and by the\n1950\ns was at the Institute for Advanced Study. He persuaded\nGödel\nto invite Kreisel to the Institute for Advanced Study and Kreisel arrived there in the summer of\n1955\n. Verena Huber-Dyson writes in\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nAlthough he did not come with the explicit intention of staying, and the possibility of return to Europe was open to him, Kreisel did not have strong ties to his position at Reading, a rather puzzling domicile for a person of his peculiar qualities.\nKreisel returned to Reading in\n1957\nbut kept up a mathematically important correspondence with\nGödel\n. In\n1958\n-\n59\nKreisel was back in the United States, this time at Stanford. After returning to Reading for his last year on the staff there in\n1959\n-\n60\nhe spent the two years\n1960\n-\n62\nin Paris.\nIn\n1962\nKreisel returned to the United States and was appointed to Stanford where he remained on the staff until he retired in\n1985\n.\nS Feferman in\n[\n1\n]\nwrites about Kreisel's contributions:-\nThrough his own contributions\n(\nindividual and collaborative\n)\nand his extraordinary personal influence, Georg Kreisel did perhaps more than anyone else to promote the development of proof theory and the metamathematics of constructivity in the last forty years.\nOne important aspect which Kreisel worked on over a period of\n30\nyears was his \"unwinding\". In\n1958\nin a paper\nMathematical significance of consistency proof\nin\n1958\nKreisel wrote:-\nThere is a different general program which does not seem to suffer the defects of\n[\nHilbert\n's\n]\nconsistency program: To determine the constructive\n(\nrecursive\n)\ncontent or the constructive equivalent of the non-constructive concepts and theorems used in mathematics, particularly in arithmetic and analysis.\nThis \"different general program\" he later gave the more colourful name \"unwinding program\". As Feferman writes\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nIt aimed to substitute clear mathematical results for what were said to be vague, misplaced, crude foundational goals. But, as with his work on constructivity, Kreisel also sought to replace those by a more sophisticated stance about foundations.\nKreisel was elected a fellow of the\nRoyal Society of London\nin\n1966\n.",
