  "biografia": "Daniel Bernoulli\nwas the son of\nJohann Bernoulli\n. He was born in Groningen while his father held the chair of mathematics there. His older brother was\nNicolaus\n(\nII\n)\nBernoulli\nand his uncle was\nJacob Bernoulli\nso he was born into a family of leading mathematicians but also into a family where there was unfortunate rivalry, jealousy and bitterness.\nYou can see the Bernoulli family tree at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nWhen Daniel was five years old the family returned to their native city of Basel where Daniel's father filled the chair of mathematics left vacant on the death of his uncle\nJacob Bernoulli\n. When Daniel was five years old his younger brother\nJohann\n(\nII\n)\nBernoulli\nwas born. All three sons would go on to study mathematics but this was not the course that\nJohann Bernoulli\nplanned for Daniel.\nJohann Bernoulli\n's father had tried to force Johann into a business career and he had resisted strongly. Rather strangely\nJohann Bernoulli\nnow tried exactly the same with his own son Daniel. First however Daniel was sent to Basel University at the age of\n13\nto study philosophy and logic. He obtained his baccalaureate examinations in\n1715\nand went on to obtain his master's degree in\n1716\n. Daniel, like his father, really wanted to study mathematics and during the time he studied philosophy at Basel, he was learning the methods of the calculus from his father and his older brother\nNicolaus\n(\nII\n)\nBernoulli\n.\nJohann was determined that Daniel should become a merchant and he tried to place him in an apprenticeship. However Daniel was as strongly opposed to this as his own father had been and soon Johann relented but certainly not as far as to let Daniel study mathematics. Johann declared that there was no money in mathematics and so he sent Daniel back to Basel University to study medicine. This Daniel did spending time studying medicine at Heidelberg in\n1718\nand Strasbourg in\n1719\n. He returned to Basel in\n1720\nto complete his doctorate in medicine.\nBy this stage\nJohann Bernoulli\nwas prepared to teach his son more mathematics while he studied medicine and Daniel studied his father's theories of kinetic energy. What he learned on the conservation of energy from his father he applied to his medical studies and Daniel wrote his doctoral dissertation on the mechanics of breathing. So like his father Daniel had applied mathematical physics to medicine in order to obtain his medical doctorate.\nDaniel wanted to embark on an academic career like his father so he applied for two chairs at Basel. His application for the chair of anatomy and botany was decided by drawing of lots and he was unlucky in this game of chance. The next chair to fall vacant at Basel that Daniel applied for was the chair of logic, but again the game of chance of the final selection by drawing of lots went against him. Having failed to obtain an academic post, Daniel went to Venice to study practical medicine.\nIn Venice Daniel was severely ill and so was unable to carry out his intention of travelling to Padua to further his medical studies. However, while in Venice he worked on mathematics and his first mathematical work was published in\n1724\nwhen, with\nGoldbach\n's assistance,\nMathematical exercises\nwas published. This consisted of four separate parts being four topics that had attracted his interest while in Venice.\nThe first part described the game of faro and is of little importance other than showing that Daniel was learning about\nprobability\nat this time. The second part was on the flow of water from a hole in a container and discussed\nNewton\n's theories\n(\nwhich were incorrect\n)\n. Daniel had not solved the problem of pressure by this time but again the work shows that his interest was moving in this direction. His medical work on the flow of blood and blood pressure also gave him an interest in fluid flow. The third part of\nMathematical exercises\nwas on the\nRiccati\ndifferential equation\nwhile the final part was on a geometry question concerning figures bounded by two arcs of a circle.\nWhile in Venice, Daniel had also designed an hour glass to be used at sea so that the trickle of sand was constant even when the ship was rolling in heavy seas. He submitted his work on this to the\nParis Academy\nand in\n1725\n, the year he returned from Italy to Basel, he learnt that he had won the prize of the\nParis Academy\n. Daniel had also attained fame through his work\nMathematical exercises\nand on the strength of this he was invited to take up the chair of mathematics at St Petersburg. His brother\nNicolaus\n(\nII\n)\nBernoulli\nwas also offered a chair of mathematics at St Petersburg so in late\n1725\nthe two brothers travelled to St Petersburg.\nWithin eight months of their taking up the appointments in St Petersburg Daniel's brother died of fever. Daniel was left, greatly saddened at the loss of his brother and also very unhappy with the harsh climate. He thought of returning to Basel and wrote to his father telling him how unhappy he was in St Petersburg.\nJohann Bernoulli\nwas able to arrange for one of his best pupils,\nLeonard Euler\n, to go to St Petersburg to work with Daniel.\nEuler\narrived in\n1727\nand this period in St Petersburg, which Daniel left in\n1733\n, was to be his most productive time.\nOne of the topics which Daniel studied in St Petersburg was that of vibrating systems. As Straub writes in\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nFrom\n1728\n, Bernoulli and\nEuler\ndominated the mechanics of flexible and elastic bodies, in that year deriving the equilibrium curves for these bodies. ... Bernoulli determined the shape that a perfectly flexible thread assumes when acted upon by forces of which one component is vertical to the curve and the other is parallel to a given direction. Thus, in one stroke he derived the entire series of such curves as the velaria, lintearia, catenaria...\nWhile in St Petersburg he made one of his most famous discoveries when he defined the simple nodes and the frequencies of oscillation of a system. He showed that the movements of strings of musical instruments are composed of an infinite number of harmonic vibrations all superimposed on the string.\nA second important work which Daniel produced while in St Petersburg was one on probability and political economy. Daniel makes the assumption that the moral value of the increase in a person's wealth is inversely proportional to the amount of that wealth. He then assigns probabilities to the various means that a person has to make money and deduces an expectation of increase in moral expectation. Daniel applied some of his deductions to insurance.\nUndoubtedly the most important work which Daniel Bernoulli did while in St Petersburg was his work on hydrodynamics. Even the term itself is based on the title of the work which he produced called\nHydrodynamica\nand, before he left St Petersburg, Daniel left a draft copy of the book with a printer. However the work was not published until\n1738\nand although he revised it considerably between\n1734\nand\n1738\n, it is more the presentation that he changed rather then the substance.\nThis work contains for the first time the correct analysis of water flowing from a hole in a container. This was based on the principle of conservation of energy which he had studied with his father in\n1720\n. Daniel also discussed pumps and other machines to raise water. One remarkable discovery appears in Chapter\n10\nof\nHydrodynamica\nwhere Daniel discussed the basis for the kinetic theory of gases. He was able to give the basic laws for the theory of gases and gave, although not in full detail, the equation of state discovered by Van der Waals a century later.\nDaniel Bernoulli was not happy in St Petersburg, despite the obvious scientific advantage of working with\nEuler\n. By\n1731\nhe was applying for posts in Basel but probability seemed to work against him and he would lose out in the ballot for the post. The post was neither one in mathematics nor physics but Daniel preferred to return to Basel and give lectures on botany rather than remain in St Petersburg. By this time his younger brother\nJohann\n(\nII\n)\nBernoulli\nwas also with him in St Petersburg and they left St Petersburg in\n1733\n, making visits to Danzig, Hamburg, Holland and Paris before returning to Basel in\n1734\n.\nDaniel Bernoulli submitted an entry for the Grand Prize of the\nParis Academy\nfor\n1734\ngiving an application of his ideas to astronomy. This had unfortunate consequences since Daniel's father,\nJohann Bernoulli\n, also entered for the prize and their entries were declared joint winners of the Grand Prize. The result of this episode of the prize of the\nParis Academy\nhad unhappy consequences for Daniel. His father was furious to think that his son had been rated as his equal and this resulted in a breakdown in relationships between the two. The outcome was that Daniel found himself back in Basel but banned from his father's house. Whether this caused Daniel to become less interested in mathematics or whether it was the fact that his academic position was a non mathematical one, certainly Daniel never regained the vigour for mathematical research that he showed in St Petersburg.\nAlthough Daniel had left St Petersburg, he began an immediate correspondence with\nEuler\nand the two exchanged many ideas on vibrating systems.\nEuler\nused his great analytic skills to put many of Daniel's physical insights into a rigorous mathematical form. Daniel continued to work on polishing his masterpiece\nHydrodynamica\nfor publication and added a chapter on the force of reaction of a jet of fluid and the force of a jet of water on an inclined plane. In this chapter, Chapter\n13\n, he also discussed applications to the propulsion of ships.\nThe\n1737\nprize of the Paris Academy also had a nautical theme, the best shape for a ship's anchor, and Daniel Bernoulli was again the joint winner of this prize, this time jointly with\nPoleni\n.\nHydrodynamica\nwas published in\n1738\nbut, in the following year\nJohann Bernoulli\npublished\nHydraulica\nwhich is largely based on his son's work but Johann tried to make it look as if Daniel had based\nHydrodynamica\non\nHydraulica\nby predating the date of publication on his book to\n1732\ninstead of its real date which is probably\n1739\n. This was a disgraceful attempt by Johann to gain credit for work which was not his and at the same time to discredit his own son and shows the depths to which the bad feeling between them had reached.\nIt is fair to say that there is no evidence that Daniel was in any way to blame for the breakdown of relationships with his father. Rather the reverse since there is evidence that he tried to mend the relationship with such acts as describing himself on the frontispiece of\nHydrodynamica\nas 'Daniel Bernoulli, son of Johann'. Another sign that Daniel was not jealous of members of his own family in the way the\nJohann Bernoulli\nand\nJacob Bernoulli\nhad been is the fact that he did produce joint work with his younger brother\nJohann\n(\nII\n)\nBernoulli\n.\nBotany lectures were not what Daniel wanted and things became better for him in\n1743\nwhen he was able to exchange these for physiology lectures. In\n1750\n, however, he was appointed to the chair of physics and taught physics at Basel for\n26\nyears until\n1776\n. He gave some remarkable physics lectures with experiments performed during the lectures. Based on experimental evidence he was able to conjecture certain laws which were not verified until many years later. Among these was\nCoulomb\n's law in electrostatics.\nDaniel Bernoulli did produce other excellent scientific work during these many years back in Basel. In total he won the Grand Prize of the\nParis Academy\n10\ntimes, for topics in astronomy and nautical topics. He won in\n1740\n(\njointly with\nEuler\n)\nfor work on\nNewton\n's theory of the tides; in\n1743\nand\n1746\nfor essays on magnetism; in\n1747\nfor a method to determine time at sea; in\n1751\nfor an essay on ocean currents; in\n1753\nfor the effects of forces on ships; and in\n1757\nfor proposals to reduce the pitching and tossing of a ship in high seas.\nAnother important aspect of Daniel Bernoulli's work that proved important in the development of mathematical physics was his acceptance of many of\nNewton\n's theories and his use of these together with the tolls coming from the more powerful calculus of\nLeibniz\n. Daniel worked on mechanics and again used the principle of conservation of energy which gave an integral of\nNewton\n's basic equations. He also studied the movement of bodies in a resisting medium using\nNewton\n's methods.\nHe also continued to produce good work on the theory of oscillations and in a paper he gave a beautiful account of the oscillation of air in organ pipes. His strengths and weaknesses are summed up by Straub in\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nBernoulli's active and imaginative mind dealt with the most varied scientific areas. Such wide interests, however, often prevented him from carrying some of his projects to completion. It is especially unfortunate that he could not follow the rapid growth of mathematics that began with the introduction of\npartial differential equations\ninto mathematical physics. Nevertheless he assured himself a permanent place in the history of science through his work and discoveries in hydrodynamics, his anticipation of the kinetic theory of gases, a novel method for calculating the value of an increase in assets, and the demonstration that the most common movement of a string in a musical instrument is composed of the superposition of an infinite number of harmonic vibrations...\nDaniel Bernoulli was much honoured in his own lifetime. He was elected to most of the leading scientific societies of his day including those in Bologna,\nSt Petersburg\n,\nBerlin\n,\nParis\n,\nLondon\n, Bern,\nTurin\n, Zürich and Mannheim.",
