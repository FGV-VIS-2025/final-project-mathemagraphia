  "summary": "Peter Borwein was a Scottish born mathematician who spent most of his career in Canada. He is perhaps best known for his research and publications on π.",
  "biografia": "Peter Borwein\nwas the son of\nDavid Borwein\nand Bessie Flax.\nDavid Borwein\nhad been born in Lithuania but was brought up and educated to B.Sc. level in South Africa. He married Bessie, who was studying Botany and Zoology at the University of Witwatersrand, on\n30\nJune\n1946\nin Yeoville, Johannesburg. They emigrated to Britain in\n1948\nand\nDavid\nwas awarded a Ph.D. in mathematics from the University of London in\n1950\n. In the same year he was appointed as a lecturer in mathematics at the University of St Andrews in Scotland. In St Andrews the Borwein family lived at Alvie, Buchanan Gardens\n(1950\n-\n1953)\n, West View Cottage, Lade Braes Lane\n(1954\n-\n1958)\n, and then\n4\nAbbotsford Place\n(1959)\n. They had a house built at\n10\nStrathkinness High Road\n(\nWest Acres\n)\nand moved into the house in\n1960\n.\nDavid\nand Bessie's three children were all born in St Andrews:\nJonathan Michael Borwein\n(\nknown as Jon\n)\n, an exceptionally talented mathematician, was born on\n20\nMay\n1951\n; Peter Benjamin Borwein, the subject of this biography, was born on\n10\nMay\n1953\n; and Sarah Tanya Borwein, who became a medical doctor, was born in\n1961\n.\nJonathan\nand Peter had a happy childhood. Peter Borwein said\n[\n10\n]\n:-\nI have fond memories of growing up with\nJon\n, as young boys in St Andrews, Scotland. An early memory ... is of us fishing off the pier in St Andrews with our dad\nDavid\n. We would catch rock cod, and make my mother Bessie clean them and make fish cakes.\nJon\nand I also spent much of our childhood with our guinea pigs, Gilbert and Gulliver. My dad built a cage for them with no bottom, so that the guinea pigs would move around the lawn, acting as lawnmowers. As young boys we also shared a bedroom in St Andrews. I used to keep\nJon\nawake at night, by reminding him that the universe was infinite. This bothered him to no end. It's no surprise that he ended up as a mathematician.\nIn fact not only did the boys share a bedroom but, from\n1954\nto\n1957\n, they shared a bed\n(\nend-to-end\n)\n. Because of their mother's zoology interests, the boys often had unusual pets, for example a Xenopus Toad. St Andrews is famed for its beaches with golden sands. During the summer months, children had donkey rides on the West Sands. This proved a problem for Peter, however, since he loved donkeys but hated sand! Another thing that he loved to do was to camp in the garden\n[\n8\n]\n:-\nAs kids a big treat was to be allowed to camp and freeze in the garden - in a one-man tent that had been to the top of K\n2\nin the early\n1950\ns.\nDavid Borwein\nattended the International Congress of Mathematicians in Edinburgh in August\n1958\nand delivered the short communication\nMultiplication of\n(\nC\n,\n−\nκ\n)\n(C, -\\kappa)\n(\nC\n,\n−\nκ\n)\n-summable series\n. Five year old Peter went to Edinburgh with his father and was registered as a participant and given a name badge. He began his studies in the Madras Primary\n(\ncalled the 'Kinder'\n)\nimmediately after the Congress and was proud to wear his Congress name badge, pinned on his Madras blazer, on his first day at school. In\n1959\nhe caught scarlet fever. At that time it was a notifiable disease which had to be reported to the public-health authorities. Peter had to be quarantined in his home for a month.\nIn September\n1963\nthe Borwein family moved to London, Ontario, Canada when\nDavid Borwein\njoined the Mathematics Department at the University of Western Ontario. Peter continued his education at London Central Secondary School at the corner of Dufferin Avenue and Waterloo Street. He graduated in\n1971\nand began his studies at the University of Western Ontario. His brother\nJonathan\nwrites\n[\n8\n]\n:-\nPeter lived with a future CBC Morningside producer, an ex porn publisher, and a large python.\nIn the summer of\n1972\nPeter Borwein and his brother\nJonathan\ntravelled in Europe following the \"ten dollars a day\" book. Back at the University of Western Ontario, in\n1973\nhe met Jennifer Moore who was studying psychology. In the following year he graduated with a B.Sc. from the University of Western Ontario and, together with Jennifer, he went to the University of British Columbia in Vancouver to study for his Master's Degree. His advisor was John James Francis Fournier who had been awarded a Ph.D. by the University of Wisconsin-Madison in\n1967\nfor his thesis\nExtensions of a Fourier Multiplier Theorem of Paley\n. In\n1976\nBorwein was awarded an M.Sc. from the University of British Columbia and continued to study there for a Ph.D. advised by David W Boyd. Boyd had been awarded a B.Sc. from Carlton University in\n1963\nand a Ph.D. from the University of Toronto in\n1966\nfor his thesis\nThe Hilbert Transformation on Rearrangement Invariant Banach Spaces\n. After appointments at the University of Alberta and the California Institute of Technology, he had been appointed to the University of British Columbia in\n1971\n.\nIn the summer of\n1978\nPeter and\nJonathan\nagain travelled in Europe. Peter's research was going well and he published his first paper in\n1978\n, namely\nArbitrarily Slow Rational Approximations on the Positive Real Line\n. The paper begins:-\nThis paper will exhibit positive, non-decreasing, infinitely differentiable functions f with the property that the best rational approximations of degree n in the supremum norm to\n1\n/f on\n[0\n, ∞\n)\ntend to zero arbitrarily slowly. Furthermore, such f can be chosen to have very general growth characteristics at infinity. In particular, this demonstrates that two conjectures of\nErdős\nand Reddy are false.\nIt contains the acknowledgement:-\nThe author wishes to thank Dr D W Boyd for many useful discussions.\nIn\n1979\nPeter Borwein was awarded a Ph.D. for his thesis\nRestricted Uniform Rational Approximations\n. He published the paper\nApproximations by Rational Functions with Positive Coefficients\n(1980)\nwhich considers the problem of approximating analytic functions with positive coefficients by rational functions with positive coefficients. He gives the following acknowledgement:-\nSome of the results of this paper occur in the author's Ph.D. dissertation at the University of British Columbia under the supervision of Dr D Boyd, to whom the author wishes to express his gratitude.\nThis was one of three papers which he published in\n1980\ncontaining results from his thesis. Supported by the National Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada, he then spent the year\n1979\n-\n80\nin England as a postdoctoral student at the University of Oxford. During that year he submitted for publication the paper\nApproximation of\nx\nn\nx^{n}\nx\nn\nby reciprocals of polynomials\n(1981)\n.\nBack in Canada after the year in England, Peter Borwein was appointed to Dalhousie University in\n1980\njoining his brother\nJonathan\nwho was already on the faculty there. Later that year, on Thursday,\n27\nNovember\n1980\n, Peter married Jennifer: they had three daughters, Alexandra Borwein\n(\nborn\n1987\n, known as Alex\n)\n, Sophie Borwein\n(\nborn\n1989)\n, and Tessa Borwein\n(\nborn\n1993)\n.\nThe brothers were now producing excellent research papers and both were keen on collaborations, yet they had not worked together on any mathematics projects up to this time. In fact, surprisingly, they had not even discussed mathematics at any time in their lives up to this point. Now both were on the faculty at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, this changed with\nJonathan\nand Peter making up for lost time and undertaking many joint research collaborations. Before we look at this aspect of Peter Borwein's career, perhaps we should give a few details about Peter's sister Sarah Borwein. Sarah was ten years younger than\nJonathan\nand eight years younger than Peter so by the start of the\n1980\ns she was an undergraduate student. With a father and two brothers all enthusiastic mathematics researchers, it was natural for Sarah to move towards that topic. She completed a mathematics and economics degree from Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, Canada and then went to Oxford, England on a Commonwealth Scholarship where she completed an M.Sc. in economics. She saw the passion for mathematics that her father and two brothers had and realised that, although she had the ability, she did not have that passion. She studied medicine, completed an MD at the University of Toronto, married the computer scientist Andrew Nevin, and became a medical doctor in Hong Kong.\nPeter and\nJonathan Borwein\n's first joint paper was\nA very rapidly convergent product expansion for\nπ\n(1983)\n. The paper begins:-\nThere has recently been considerable interest in an essentially quadratic method for computing π. The algorithm, first suggested by Salamin, is based upon an identity known to\nGauss\n. This iteration has been used by two Japanese researchers, Y Tamura and Y Kanada, to compute\n2\n23\n2^{23}\n2\n2\n3\ndecimal digits of π in under\n7\nhours. They have now successfully computed\n2\n24\n2^{24}\n2\n2\n4\ndigits\n(\nmore than\n16\n.\n7\nmillion places\n)\n. This is reported in the January\n1983\n'Scientific American' and the February\n1983\n'Discover Magazine'. In the process of surveying this and related fast methods of computing elementary functions, the authors discovered a new quadratically convergent product expansion for π. Our algorithm, like Salamin's, is intimately related to the Gaussian arithmetic-geometric mean iteration. However, it requires considerably less elliptic function theory to establish.\nThis was the first of many joint papers on computing π, the next few being:\nThe arithmetic-geometric mean and fast computation of elementary functions\n(1984)\n;\nCubic and higher order algorithms for π\n(1984)\n;\nExplicit algebraic nth order approximations to π\n(1984)\n;\nMore quadratically converging algorithms for π\n(1986)\n; and\nAn explicit cubic iteration for π\n(1986)\n. In\n1987\nthey published the book\nPi and the AGM\nwhich demonstrated not only their mathematical skills but also their ability to explain and entertain. Peter Cass writes\n[\n11\n]\n:-\nThis exciting and well-written book is the product of the sound scholarship and enormous enthusiasm of its authors. The subtitle, 'A study in analytic number theory and computational complexity', captures its central theme very well.\nJet Wimp writes\n[\n26\n]\n:-\nThe authors are cultured mathematicians. They have selected what has amused and intrigued them in the hope that it will do the same for us. Frankly, I cannot think of a more provocative and generous recipe for writing a book. Intellectually, what can we really offer one another more genuine than our own excitement? - for, as much as some pretend otherwise, there is no trustworthy yardstick for the value of a piece of mathematics. The book is cleanly, even beautifully, written ...\nFor more information about this book, and other books by Peter Borwein, see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nNow we must not give the impression that Peter Borwein's publications were all with his brother from\n1983\nonwards. MathSciNet lists\n35\njoint publications by\nJonathan\nand Peter Borwein, while a total of\n183\npublications by Peter Borwein are listed. David Bailey writes in\n[\n4\n]\n:-\nPeter Borwein's published research spanned classical analysis, computational number theory, Diophantine number theory, symbolic computing, experimental mathematics and applied mathematics. This research includes several rather important results. As one example, Peter Borwein, together with Tamás Erdélyi, Ronald Ferguson, and Richard Lockhart, settled\nLittlewood\n's Problem\n22\n. ... In another notable example, Peter, in collaboration with Edward Dobrowolski and Michael J Mossinghoff, solved a problem of\nLehmer\non polynomials with odd coefficients.\nPeter Borwein's most remarkable result on π was, in fact, not done in collaboration with his brother. This is in the paper\nOn the rapid computation of various polylogarithmic constants\n(1997)\nwritten in collaboration with David Bailey and Simon Plouffe. The paper\n[\n4\n]\n:-\n... arose when Peter posed the question to some students and postdocs of whether there was any economical way to calculate digits in some base of a mathematical constant such as π, beginning at a given digit position, without needing to calculate the preceding digits. Peter himself subsequently found\n[\na\n]\nsurprisingly simple scheme for binary digits of log\n2\n...\nBoth brothers lectured at the Ramanujan Centennial International Conference held\n15\n-\n18\nDecember\n1987\nin Annamalai Nagar in the Cuddalore district of the state of Tamil Nadu, India.\nPeter Borwein was one of the leading figures in a strike at Dalhousie University in\n1988\n. The faculty voted to strike in September of that year and the strike took place from\n4\nNovember to\n22\nNovember. The majority of faculty, including both Borwein brothers, did not teach during the strike. Peter Borwein was in charge of public relations and created the slogan for the strike, \"Building a better university - sorry for the inconvenience!\"\nBoth Peter Borwein and his brother\nJonathan\njoined the Department of Mathematics of Simon Fraser University in\n1993\nand they founded the Centre for Experimental and Constructive Mathematics. This university is in Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada. It was in this year that Borwein was awarded the first of many prestigious prizes. The\nChauvenet\nPrize\n1993\nwas awarded jointly to Peter Borwein,\nJonathan Borwein\nand David Bailey for their paper\nRamanujan, Modular Equations, and Approximations to Pi, or, How to Compute One Billion Digits of Pi\nwhich had been published in the\nAmerican Mathematical Monthly\n. The\nChauvenet\nPrize is awarded by the\nMathematical Association of America\nand that Association also awarded the same three authors their Merten M Hasse Prize\n1993\nfor the same paper. Peter Borwein received further awards such as 'Academic of the Year for\n1996\n' from the Confederation of University Faculty Associations of British Columbia, the University of Western Ontario National Alumni Merit Award\n1999\n, and the\nLester R Ford\nAward\n2002\n, jointly with Loki Jorgenson, for their paper\nVisible Structures in Number Theory\nin the\nAmerican Mathematical Monthly\n.\nPeter Borwein also gave much to the mathematical community in his role as a journal editor. He served on the Editorial Boards of:\nMathematics of Computation\n;\nCanadian Journal of Mathematics\n;\nJournal of Approximation Theory\n;\nComputational Complexity\n;\nRamanujan Quarterly\n; and\nElectronic Transactions in Numerical Analysis\n.\nOn\n6\nJuly\n1999\nBorwein gave a lecture in Budapest. This report of the lecture by Peter Cameron illustrates his humour:-\nPeter Borwein gave a lovely talk interspersed with cartoons. My favourite was the research institute with two signs: \"Unanswered questions\" and \"Unquestioned answers.\" He asked, \"If\nErdős\nhad got the job at the IAS in Princeton, would he have touched our lives in the way he did?\"\nIn\n2004\nPeter Borwein founded the Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in the Mathematical and Computational Sciences\n(\nIRMACS\n)\nat Simon Fraser University. He became the director of IRMACS. Carol Thorbes writes\n[\n25\n]\n:-\nMove over creators of Max Head-room, Matrix and Metropolis. What researchers can accomplish at Simon Fraser University's IRMACS centre rivals the high tech feats of the most memorable futuristic films.\nThe $\n14\nmillion centre's acronym stands for Interdisciplinary Research in the Mathematical and Computational Sciences. The centre's expansive view of the Lower Mainland from atop Burnaby Mountain echoes its limitless potential as a facility dedicated to fostering interdisciplinary research among scientists whose primary laboratory tool is the computer.\nA newly constructed\n2\n,\n500\nsquare metre space atop the applied sciences building, the centre has eight labs, five meeting rooms and a presentation theatre, seating up to\n100\npeople. They are equipped with easily upgradable computational, multimedia, internet and remote conferencing\n(\nincluding satellite\n)\ntechnology. High performance distributed computing and clustering technology, designed at SFU, and access to WestGrid, an ultra high-speed, interprovincial network, with shared computing and multimedia resources, make IRMACS unique in Western Canada.\nAlready by the time IRMACS was up and running, Peter Borwein had made known that he was suffering from multiple sclerosis. In fact he had been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in\n1999\nbut it only became widely known in\n2004\n. David Bailey writes that multiple sclerosis\n[\n3\n]\n:-\n... left him confined to a wheelchair, increasingly unable to pursue his research, and increasingly dependent on family and caregivers. I recall visiting Peter in January\n2019\nat his home in Burnaby, British Columbia. In spite of his paralysis and infirmity, I was astonished at his pleasant demeanour and ever-present humour. Would that we could all bear our misfortunes with as much strength and courage!\nTributes to Peter Borwein at his\n60\nth birthday meeting in May\n2013\nwere by Kevin Hare, Karl Dilcher and Mike Mossinghoff. They appear in\n[\n8\n]\nand, in shortened form, in\n[\n4\n]\n. Kevin Hare said:-\nI guess some of the things that come to mind are how my first paper with Peter came about. We were at the International Symposium on Symbolic and Algebraic Computation conference in Vancouver. Peter came up to me over lunch and said something to the effect of \"This afternoon looks really boring, did you want to go hiking instead?\" Next thing I knew, he had organised a few people to go up the grouse grind. On the way up he decided to start asking me math questions.\n(\nAnd I guess more importantly, I was able to ask him math questions without him getting distracted by phone calls.\n)\nI found his approach to supervising was basically, toss lots of questions at me and hope that one of them sticks. If anybody has ever sat beside him during a conference talk, they know exactly what I mean by that. Or, I guess anybody that has been sitting with him in a pub/coffee shop while conference talks are going on also knows what I am talk about.\nThe only other thing I can think of really is his addiction to coffee. I remember going to a conference in Portland while he was driving us all in a mini-van. I suspect during what should have been a\n6\nhour drive, we stopped for coffee about\n8\ntimes. It was during this drive that he decided on the naming conventions for all of the Mitacs machines,\n(\nall after some type of coffee\n)\n. Since then, he got his espresso machine in his office, and he is probably even more addicted.\nKarl Dilcher said:-\nPeter was my \"official\" Post Doctoral Fellow supervisor, and I believe I was his first Post Doctoral Fellow. Without his support and encouragement I would probably not be where I am now. What I admired\n(\nand still admire\n)\nmost about Peter is the fact that he always has a problem, or problems, on his mind; he will ask you, prod you, share insights with you and be very persistent. When he has found a truly exciting and worthwhile problem, he will not let go until it is solved. He will hack away at it from all directions, will try to get others interested and involved\n(\nand often succeed in this\n)\n, and more often than not he will eventually make substantial progress, either alone, or in collaboration with others.\nAn example for this is the spectacular Bailey-Borwein-Plouffe formula. Already during his time at Dalhousie he often said that he wanted to find the\n10\nbillionth\n(\nI believe\n)\ndigit of pi without having to know all the previous digits. I had no doubt that he would eventually succeed, and I consider Bailey-Borwein-Plouffe as a result of this\n(\nthough hexadecimal instead of decimal\n)\n.\nPeter likes funny anecdotes, often related to mathematics or mathematicians.\n[\nOne\n]\nI remember: A visit with daughter Alex as a toddler to Point Pleasant Park, when Alex pointed to the Sailors Memorial and said, 'look, Daddy, a big plus!' Peter was and is an excellent writer and expositor. But there wasn't a name, usually foreign, that he wouldn't find a way to misspell. One time in the mid-\n90\ns I got a\n(\npositive\n)\nreferee report in which every name was incorrect; I KNEW that Peter had to be the referee. When I gave him an off-print later on, I remarked that I thought he might already be familiar with the paper. Peter, very surprised, \"How do you know I refereed it?\" I had to tell him the truth.\nMike Mossinghoff said:-\nIt's always a pleasure to visit Peter and his family and friends in \"Mahler measure heaven\", as Jeff Vaaler has called Vancouver. But one of my most memorable meetings with Peter was in Nashville, at an approximation theory meeting in the late\n90\n's. I was just passing through, driving from North Carolina to Texas, but my wife and I briefly crashed the conference to join Peter for lunch at a local Indian buffet. I'd visited Simon Fraser University the prior summer, and we'd had some correspondence on some problems. But it was at lunch in Nashville that we hammered out plans for our first joint paper.\nWorking with Peter has always been just as comfortable. Since that lunch meeting, I have visited Peter some six or seven times at Simon Fraser and the Centre for Experimental and Constructive Mathematics and IRMACS, and we now have some nine papers together.\nComing to Simon Fraser University was always an exciting time. Peter seems to have an incredible knack for suggesting just the right sort of problem to his collaborators - problems that are not only irresistible, but very well-suited to the listener's interests. He's a lot like\nErdős\nin this respect. Each time I arrived in Vancouver, Peter always had a fascinating new project that was just irresistible to join.\nA great sadness to Peter Borwein was the sudden death of his brother\nJonathan\nin\n2016\n. Peter died of pneumonia on Sunday\n23\nAugust\n2020\nin Ward\n3\nD of Burnaby Hospital with his wife Jennie by his side. The pneumonia was a secondary condition caused by the multiple sclerosis which he\n[\n2\n]\n:-\n... bore with remarkable grace and courage. He was until the end smart, funny, mischievous, kind, interesting and interested.",
