  "summary": "Júlio César de Mello e Souza was a Brazilian mathematician who wrote very popular texts such as The man who counted under the pseudonym Malba Tahan. Brazil's National Day of Mathematics was instituted in 2013 to be on 6 May, Mello e Souza's birthday",
  "biografia": "Júlio César de Mello e Souza\nwas the son of Joao de Deus de Mello e Souza\n(8\nMarch\n1863\n-\n9\nMarch\n1911)\nand Carolina Carlos de Toledo Mello\n(4\nNovember\n1866\n-\n1\nJune\n1025)\n. Joao de Deus had been born in Rio de Janeiro to parents who had emigrated from Portugal. He worked in the office of an industrial company but in\n1884\nwent to Queluz where, together with his brother Irineu de Mello e Souza, he founded a boarding school for the children of farmers, the 'Colégio Joao de Deus'. Carolina had moved from Serra Negra to Queluz when she was seventeen years old to take over running the local primary school. Joao de Deus and Carolina met and married when Carolina was eighteen. Their eldest three children, Maria Antonieta de Mello e Souza\n(1885\n-\n1952)\n, Laura Marieta de Mello e Souza\n(1889\n-\n1940)\nand Joao Baptista de Mello e Souza\n(1888\n-\n1969)\n, were all born in Queluz. Brazil hit hard economic times with a decline of the coffee farms, and the Colégio Joao de Deus was forced to close. Joao de Deus, with his wife and three children, returned to Rio de Janeiro where he worked for the Ministry of Justice. Julieta de Mello e Souza\n(1893\n-\n1981)\nand Júlio César de Mello e Souza\n(\nknown as Julinho\n)\n, the subject of this biography, were born in Rio de Janeiro. Júlio César had four younger siblings: Nelson Carlos de Mello e Souza\n(1898\n-\n1948)\n, Rubens de Mello e Souza\n(1900\n-\n1924)\n, Olga de Mello e Souza\n(1902\n-\n1973)\nand Jose Carlos de Mello e Souza\n(1905\n-\n1990)\n. Seven of the nine children would become teachers. Let us note at this point that Rubens became a test pilot and died testing a plane when only\n24\nyears old.\nConditions in Rio de Janeiro were difficult and the family returned to Queluz where Carolina ran a school with four classes all in the living room of her home. Júlio César was taught at the school by his mother but also helped with tasks such as cleaning the blackboard, giving back homework, etc. Júlio César\n[\n3\n]\n:-\n... was a child of great vitality and imagination. Inventive and mischievous, his favourite toy was the frogs in the backyard and on the banks of the Paraíba River. To the bulging frogs he gave solemn names of \"Monsignor\" and \"Illustrious Sir\". As a little boy, he played at teaching a group of frogs and leading them with a wand. The memory of the joy with the frogs of his childhood became famous. As an adult, many friends and admirers began to present him with replicas of frogs in crockery, wood, iron, jade and crystal.\nBoth Júlio César and his older brother Joao Baptista were given private lessons so they could sit the entrance examinations for the Military College of Rio de Janeiro. Júlio César was successful and began his studies there in\n1906\nas a boarding student. Tuition fees at the Military College were not cheap and after three years he had to leave since his father could not afford to continue paying. He said in a\n1973\ninterview\n(\nsee Appendix\n1\nof\n[\n5\n]\n)\n:-\nI left because the Colégio Militar was very expensive and Dad couldn't get it free for me and it was very hard for him, who had a lot of children, to pay for an expensive school at that time. Then I left the Colégio Militar and got a free place at Pedro II. Semi-free. And there I took my humanities course.\nHe had sat the entrance examinations for the Colégio Pedro II and performed so well that he was awarded a scholarship to cover most of the costs. He began his studies there in\n1909\n. This college, the third oldest in Brazil founded in\n1837\n, took pupils from the full range of ages. Most of the students belonged to the country's economic and political elite. At this boarding school, Júlio César would offer to write essays for his fellow pupils and in this way made some money which he used to fund his trips home and also to buy bars of his favourite chocolate. One event at the Colégio Pedro II made a particularly strong impression on the young boy. One night the principal of the college woke him up and took him outside to see\nHalley\n's Comet. It was\n18\nMay\n1910\nand he recalled it in his\n1973\ninterview\n(\nsee Appendix\n1\nof\n[\n5\n]\n)\n:-\nHow wonderful of the Director. This extraordinary man leaves his house before dawn and walks for almost an hour to get to the boarding school to wake up two boys to see\nHalley\n's Comet. We were the only ones who had remained there because the others had all been collected by their parents.\nAt this time, Mello e Souza \"had no passion for mathematics\" but he decided he wanted a career as a teacher. He explained in the\n1973\ninterview how he became a mathematics teacher\n(\nsee Appendix\n1\nof\n[\n5\n]\n)\n:-\nThere was a teacher I had, his name was Henrique César de Oliveira Costa, Costinha. ... He was a good teacher and I took a liking to Mathematics with him. But when I dedicated myself to teaching I decided to teach History, but I didn't like it. To study History you have to read books, magazines ... It's very difficult. Then I started teaching Geography, I didn't like it either because we have to be aware of countries that become independent, that become republics and I don't know what. I said to myself: \"Better not teach Geography.\" So, I started teaching Physics, but Physics has a laboratory, it's a lot of work. \"You know what, it's better to teach Mathematics.\" Because Mathematics is that thing, it doesn't vary. And then I became a mathematics teacher.\nHis father had died in March\n1911\nand Mello e Souza continued his studies in Rio de Janeiro. In October\n1912\n, he was appointed as an assistant at the National Library of Brazil in Cinelândia square in Rio de Janeiro. This library, established in\n1810\n, had only been inaugurated in its new building two years earlier on\n29\nOctober\n1910\n. It was an appointment that Mello e Souza loved, enjoying being among such a wonderful collection of books. His mother moved from Queluz to Rio de Janeiro where, in\n1913\n, she founded a new school in the Copacabana district. Mello e Souza began studying Civil Engineering at the Polytechnic School of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro in\n1913\nand also worked as a teacher at his mother's school. He also taught for four years at the Guanabara Public Primary School. In addition to studying civil engineering and teaching, he also began working for a teaching qualification taking evening classes at the Normal School, the Escola Normal do Distrito Federal, which later became the Rio de Janeiro Institute of Education. He wanted to train to be a teacher; it was important to him to understand how best to present material:-\nWhen I was a student, teachers were all self-taught. Teachers at the Colégio Militar, at Pedro II, had never taken a teacher's course, so they were real criminals. There were teachers who didn't teach anything, didn't know didactics, didn't know anything ...\nThe engineering course at the Polytechnic School was for five years and so Mello e Souza should have graduated in\n1917\nbut he chose not to at that time. In fact he graduated with his engineering degree on\n13\nSeptember\n1932\n, but we will come to that below. His publishing career began in\n1918\nwith the newspaper\nO Imparcial\nⓉ\n(\nThe Impartial\n)\n. The secretary of the paper was Leonidas de Rezende and Mello e Souza offered him some short stories he had written. They were not published and soon Mello e Souza went along to the newspaper office and asked for them back. He changed the name on the last page from Mello e Souza to R S Slady, took them back to Leonidas and told him that these were Portuguese translations he had made of stories by an American author R S Slady that were very popular in New York. The first of these,\nThe Jew's Revenge\n, was published in\nO Imparcial\nⓉ\n(\nThe Impartial\n)\non the following day and Mello e Souza decided that to be a successful author he needed to create a pseudonym. He invented Ali Ielid Izz-Edim ibn Salim Hank Malba Tahan, a believer in Allah and his holy prophet Mohammed, known simply as Malba Tahan. He explained\n(\nsee Appendix\n1\nof\n[\n5\n]\n)\n:-\nI prepared the mystification about this pseudonym for seven years\n(1918\n-\n1925)\n. I studied Islam, read the Quran and Talmud and even took private Arabic lessons with Dr Jean Achar. ... My idea was to surprise Brazil with a literary mystification. Invent an Arab writer and publish educational oriental tales.\nIn\n1925\nhe approached Irineu Marinho, director of\nA Noite\n(\nThe Night\n)\nthe most popular Brazilian newspaper published in Rio de Janeiro\n(\nsee Appendix\n1\nof\n[\n5\n]\n)\n:-\nHe received me with great kindness and sympathy at his residence in Santa Teresa. I told him the truth. My idea was to surprise Brazil with a literary mystification. Invent an Arab writer and publish educational oriental tales. Irineu Marinho read\n2\nor\n3\nshort stories\n(\nwhich I had taken as a sample\n)\nand found the idea very interesting and decided to help me. He recommended that his secretary, Euricles de Mattos, publish the tales of Malba Tahan on the front page of 'A Noite', preceding them with an apocryphal biography. ... He never revealed to anyone\n(\nnot even to Euricles\n)\nthe secret of the literary mystification of which he was not only an accomplice, but largely responsible.\nAt this time Mello e Souza was a teacher at Colégio Pedro II. He had, as we saw above, been a pupil at this school and there he had been taught by Euclides de Medeiros Guimaraes Roxo\n(1890\n-\n1950)\n, a mathematics teacher who became director of the school. In\n1921\nMello e Souza had been appointed as a Substitute Professor for Roxo at the Colégio Pedro II and two years later, after a public competition, had been appointed to a permanent post at the school.\nOn\n26\nMarch\n1925\n, Mello e Souza married Nair Marques da Costa\n(25\nJanuary\n1905\n-\n18\nJune\n1974)\n, whom he had met when she was a student at the Rio de Janeiro Institute of Education. They had three children: Rubens Sérgio de Mello e Souza\n(16\nApril\n1928\n-\n26\nJune\n2002)\n; Sônia Maria de Mello e Souza\n(5\nJuly\n1929\n-\n)\n; and Ivan Gil de Mello e Souza\n(15\nMarch\n1934\n-\n28\nJuly\n2010)\n. He spoke of his wife and family\n(\nsee Appendix\n1\nof\n[\n5\n]\n)\n:-\nNair was my student at Escola Normal ... she was my geometry student. My eldest son is called Rubens Sérgio de Mello e Souza. I named him Rubens in honour of my brother Rubens. The next, called Sônia Maria de Mello e Souza, is married to an Engineer from the City Hall. And the youngest is called Ivan Gil de Mello e Souza. Ivan Gil de Mello e Souza is not just one name, it's two names; Ivan Gil. None of them have a vocation for mathematics. My oldest son is a naval officer, he is studying law now to leave the navy. My daughter is a painter, makes paintings, and my youngest son, who is an architect, builds houses at Coabe, makes affordable houses.\nThese articles were the first of a very large number, all written by the mysterious Arab author, Malba Tahan, in newspapers and magazines throughout Brazil. Also in\n1925\nhis first book\nContos de Malba Tahan\nⓉ\n(\nTales of Malba Tahan\n)\nwas published; it was the first of over\n100\nbooks with author Malba Tahan or Júlio César de Mello e Souza. You can see the titles of some of these books at\nTHIS LINK\n.\nIn parallel with these fascinating Arab books, he published mathematics texts, for example the first were\nCurso de Matemática\nⓉ\n(\nMathematics course\n)\n(1931)\n,\nMatemática\nⓉ\n(\nMathematics\n)\n(1931)\n,\nGeometria Analítica\nⓉ\n(\nAnalytical geometry\n)\n(1931)\n,\nTrigonometria hiperbólica\nⓉ\n(\nHyperbolic trigonometry\n)\n(1932)\n,\nAlgebra\n(1932)\nand\nMatemática Comercial\nⓉ\n(\nBusiness mathematics\n)\n(1932)\n. His fame, however, came though some extraordinary books like\nMatemática divertida e curiosa\nⓉ\n(\nFun and curious mathematics\n)\n(1934)\nand, his most famous,\nThe Man Who Counted: A Collection of Mathematical Adventures\n(1937)\n. Note that we have given the title of the English translation of this last mentioned work but the date we give is for the publication of the Portuguese first edition. Here is the publisher's description of\nThe Man Who Counted\n:-\nMalba Tahan is the creation of a celebrated Brazilian mathematician looking for a way to bring some of the mysteries and pleasures of mathematics to a wider public. The adventures of Beremiz Samir, The Man Who Counted, take the reader on a journey in which, time and again, Samir summons his extraordinary mathematical powers to settle disputes, give wise advice, overcome dangerous enemies, and win for himself fame, fortune, and rich rewards. We learn of previous mathematicians and come to admire Samir's wisdom and patience. In the grace of Tahan's telling, these stories hold unusual delights for the reader.\nAlex Bellos writes\n[\n1\n]\n:-\nI love 'The Man Who Counted'. The book transports you into a magical world of Bedouins, viziers, sheiks, princes and kings, rich in references to Islamic traditions and locations in the Middle East. The maths is gentle, accessible and drives the stories. It's mostly arithmetic, but there are geometrical puzzles too, and also curiosities like the magic square - a \"square filled with numbers\", which the Sultan presents to Beremiz after it has been salvaged from the house of a calligrapher.\nFor more information about these two famous books by Mello e Souza and several others, see\nTHIS LINK\n.\nWe mentioned above that Mello e Souza graduated with an engineering degree on\n13\nSeptember\n1932\nalthough he completed the course in\n1917\n. It seems likely that he did this to improve his chances in a competition for a full professorship at the Colégio Pedro II. He entered the competition in July\n1933\nsubmitting the thesis\nEstudo elementar das curvas planas - Funçoes Modulantes\nⓉ\n(\nElementary study of plane curves - modulating functions\n)\n. He was one of five candidates for the position all of whom had engineering degrees. The candidates sat a written test on the theory of determinants, studies by\nSylvester\nand\nCayley\n, and the theorems of\nPascal\n,\nBrianchon\nand\nDesargues\nconcerning conics. The successful candidate was Haroldo Lisboa da Cunha\n(1909\n-\n1991)\nwho was certainly a fine teacher. Lisboa da Cunha later became Director of the Secondary Education Department of the Ministry of Education and then Secretary General for Education and Culture.  Later he was Professor at the Universidade do Estado da Guanabara and in\n1960\nhe became rector of the university. It was always unlikely that Mello e Souza would win against someone like Lisboa da Cunha since his revolutionary teaching methods were much criticised at the time.\nAlthough Mello e Souza is best known for\nThe Man Who Counted\n, many today find his importance to be in the teaching methods he advocated. The authors of\n[\n50\n]\nwrite:-\n... in his work beyond literary activities, Mello e Souza contributed to Mathematics Education in at least the following three ways: the publication of texts on the teaching of mathematics, the production of teaching materials and the elaboration of courses, which he taught in many parts of the nation, aimed at training teachers. In relation to the publication of texts on the teaching of mathematics, we can mention such works as 'A didática da matemática'\n(1957)\n, 'O mundo precisa de ti professor'\n(1966)\n, 'Páginas do bom professor'\n(1969)\nand 'Roteiro do bom professor'\n(1969)\n.\nAntônio José Lopes writes in\n[\n18\n]\n:-\nI want to say that, unlike most Malba Tahan fans, I was not hooked by Malba Tahan from the book \"The Man Who Counted\". I was attracted by the book \"Didática da Matemática,\" a book in which he presents his ideas on how and why to teach mathematics.\nIn\n[\n42\n]\nthe authors look in detail at Mello e Souza's teaching methods:-\nAt the time, there was an exaggerated use of symbols in the form of theorems and demonstrations, it was not intended to teach Mathematics involving reality, contextualising the contents. Malba Tahan's proposal presented a dynamic, living Mathematics, which sought to involve everyday life, reality, moving from abstraction to concrete. During his classes, he used concrete materials in the classroom, such as games, riddles, invented stories full of content and everyday situations, simulations and many other ways of teaching and learning that gave rise to more than\n125\npublished works.\nMello e Souza's home life is described in\n[\n3\n]\n:-\nAs soon as they were married in\n1925\n, Julio and Nair moved to Dona Carolina's house, Rua Almirante Gonçalves, in Copacabana, where three of Julio's brothers, José Carlos, Nelson and Rubens, also lived\n[\nNote by EFR: Rubens had died the year before\n]\n. Following the advice of his brother-in-law José Milliet, Julio Cesar bought a piece of land in Ipanema, which at the time was an immense beach. In the early\n1940\ns, with the neighbourhood's appreciation, he sold the land and finally bought a house for his family, Rua Artur Araripe\n43\n, in Gávea, a neighbourhood in the south of the city, which was beginning to be urbanised. The street was a dirt track, with no exit, and there was no public lighting or piped gas. The house was two storeys high and at the back was a yard with two leafy mango trees. Parties with relatives, friends and students were common. The card game in the living room with friends, especially \"Copacabana\", created by Malba Tahan, or the endless meetings in the second-floor office, where the writer told a thousand stories, remained in the memory of family and dear friends. Everything at the Artur Araripe house was very well taken care of, with simplicity and good taste. Nair, always pretty and whimsical, ran the services and economy of the home, as well as the education of her children, allowing Professor Malba Tahan to study and write his books.\nThere was a passion that Mello e Souza found late in his life when he devoted much effort into helping those with leprosy\n(\nsee Appendix\n1\nof\n[\n5\n]\n)\n:-\nI introduced myself to a lady called Dona Eunice and said: \"I want to work for lepers.\" She said to me, \"Look, Malba Tahan, I'm going to tell you something; the leper is ungrateful. Jesus healed ten and only one returned to give thanks.\" I then said to Dona Eunice: \"I don't care if a leper is grateful or ungrateful. I decided to work for them because they are excommunicated, they are repressed by society, they are cursed and since biblical times they have suffered horrors.\" So I decided to dedicate myself exclusively to lepers. I do not expect gratitude, nor ingratitude. But, on the contrary, I have only received proof of friendship, of sympathy from lepers. My wife says I know more lepers than healthy people. It's possible. Having visited all the leprosariums and being friends with them it is clear that I have met very sick people.\nA little of his character is related in\n[\n34\n]\n:-\nHe usually woke up at\n4\na.m. and walked around the house barefoot, looking for inspiration. His desk was filled with dictionaries, letters, books, incomplete articles or chapters, and blank papers. Often, he would sleep next to the book or encyclopaedia he was reading.\nIn June\n1974\n, Mello e Souza was still living as he had for so many years, teaching, giving courses, writing columns for newspapers and working on new books. On\n18\nJune\n1974\nhe was staying in the Hotel Boa Viagem in Recife where he was giving lectures at the conference 'The Art of Storytelling'. He rose early as usual and was preparing to deliver the talk \"Games and Recreations in Mathematics Teaching\" at Colégio Soares Dutra. He died following a heart attack at\n5\n:\n30\nin the morning. His death was reported in newspapers across Brazil in which was included the note he had written himself many years earlier:-\nMalba Tahan has died and asks everyone for forgiveness for his faults, mistakes, ingratitude and injustice. He also asks them to pray for him.\nBeginning in\n2013\n, Brazil celebrates a National Day of Mathematics on\n6\nMay, the birthday of Mello e Souza\n[\n34\n]\n:-\nIn his honour, Mathematics Day is currently celebrated in Brazil on\n6\nMay, the date of his birth. For a long time, this date was informally celebrated by the Brazilian Society of Mathematics Education, and officially in some Brazilian States, such as Rio de Janeiro, since\n1994\n. At the national level, a project was presented on\n5\nMay\n2004\nby deputy Raquel Teixeira to institute Mathematics Day. The objective was for the Ministry of Education and Culture to encourage cultural and educational activities on that date, in addition to a moment of reflection on Mathematics Education, encouraging teachers and students to cultivate culture and knowledge. Only on\n26\nJune\n2013\n, the President of the Republic, Dilma Rousseff, sanctioned a law which officially instituted the National Day of Mathematics, which must be celebrated annually throughout the national territory.\nLet us end with a comment by Jefferson Santos, the author of\n[\n34\n]\nwho is a Professor of Mathematics and undertakes research on 'Ethnomathematics' and on 'Mathematics on the African Continent':-\nI have always admired the work of author and lecturer Júlio César de Mello e Souza, whom I met at University when I was studying Mathematics through reading the book 'The man who counted'. As a result of this enchantment, interest in the \"playful\" side of Mathematics was awakened, as well as the dream of writing similar books, but I still didn't have the time, courage or opportunity. Throughout my professional journey, I have always tried to teach in line with the style of this great teacher, extolling the History of Mathematics, showing students its importance and its applications in our daily lives, as well as games, productive groupings and remembering when teaching/learning Mathematics that it is not just calculations.",
