  "biografia": "Giulio Fagnano\n's father was Francesco Fagnano and his mother was Camilla Bartolini. Giulio was born into one of the leading families in Sinigaglia. The town of Sinigaglia, now known as Senigallia, is in central Italy and at the time of Giulio's birth was part of the Papal States. In fact the family went back very many generations in their association with Sinigaglia and one of the members of the family in the\n12\nth\ncentury had been Lamberto Scannabecchi who became Pope Honorius II in\n1124\n.\nFagnano was brought up to follow the family tradition of high office in Sinigaglia. He was appointed gonfaloniere in\n1723\n.\nGonfaloniere\nliterally means \"standard bearer\" and it was a title of high civic magistrates in the medieval Italian city-states such as Sinigaglia. Such offices were not easy in these times and Fagnano was subjected to many false charges made against him by envious citizens who were maliciously trying to damage his reputation. Fagnano had many children, one of whom was\nGiovanni Fagnano\nwho followed in his father's footsteps becoming interested in mathematics.\nGiulio Fagnano was self educated in mathematics and treated the subject as a hobby. However, he achieved considerable international fame as a mathematician, and rightly so given the outstanding contributions which he made on a number of different topics.\nFagnano suggested new methods of solving equations of degree\n2\n,\n3\nand\n4\n. He improved\nBombelli\n's work on complex numbers giving a famous formula\nπ\n2\n=\nlog\n⁡\n(\n1\n−\ni\n1\n+\ni\n)\n\\Large \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\normalsize =  \\sqrt{\\log\\Large {\\left( \\frac{1-i}{1+i} \\right)}}\n2\nπ\n​\n=\nlo\ng\n(\n1\n+\ni\n1\n−\ni\n​\n)\n​\n.\nOne of the topics for which Fagnano is best known is his work on triangles. Natucci in\n[\n1\n]\nwrites:-\n... he may well be considered the founder of the geometry of the triangle.\nConsidering triangles he looked at interesting problems such as:-\nGiven\nA\nB\nC\nABC\nA\nB\nC\nfind\nP\nP\nP\nminimising\nP\nA\n2\n+\nP\nB\n2\n+\nP\nC\n2\nPA^{2} + PB^{2} + PC^{2}\nP\nA\n2\n+\nP\nB\n2\n+\nP\nC\n2\n.\nFor a quadrilateral\nA\nB\nC\nD\nABCD\nA\nB\nC\nD\nfind\nP\nP\nP\nminimising\nA\nP\n+\nB\nP\n+\nC\nP\n+\nD\nP\nAP + BP + CP + DP\nA\nP\n+\nB\nP\n+\nC\nP\n+\nD\nP\n.\nHe also discovered that if\nX\nX\nX\nis the centre of gravity of the triangle\nA\nB\nC\nABC\nA\nB\nC\nthen\nX\nA\n2\n+\nX\nB\n2\n+\nX\nC\n2\n=\n(\nA\nB\n2\n+\nB\nC\n2\n+\nC\nA\n2\n)\n/\n3\nXA^{2} + XB^{2} + XC^{2} = (AB^{2} + BC^{2} + CA^{2})/3\nX\nA\n2\n+\nX\nB\n2\n+\nX\nC\n2\n=\n(\nA\nB\n2\n+\nB\nC\n2\n+\nC\nA\n2\n)\n/\n3\n.\nIn his study of the rectification of the lemniscate, Fagnano introduced ingenious analytic transformations that laid the foundation for the theory of\nelliptic integrals\nand his work was to lead to elliptic functions. Fagnano collected many of his published works, and a few unpublished ones, and produced the two volume treatise\nProduzioni matematiche\nⓉ\n(\nMathematical Productions\n)\nin\n1750\n. In\n1751\nEuler\nwas asked to examine\nProduzioni matematiche\nⓉ\n(\nMathematical Productions\n)\nand he found in this treatise relations between special types of elliptic integrals, that express the length of an arc of a lemniscate, which were quite unexpected to him. Generalising Fagnano's results,\nEuler\nwent on to create a general theory of these integrals, in particular giving the famous addition formula for elliptic integrals. Fagnano had proved the duplication formula, a particular case of the addition formula, for the integrals.\nIn fact Fagnano had proved remarkable properties of the lemniscate, including the fact that its arcs may be divided in\nn\nn\nn\nequal parts using a\nruler and compass\nconstruction, where\nn\n=\n2\n×\n2\nm\n,\n3\n×\n2\nm\nn = 2\\times 2^{m}, 3\\times 2^{m}\nn\n=\n2\n×\n2\nm\n,\n3\n×\n2\nm\n, or\n5\n×\n2\nm\n5\\times 2^{m}\n5\n×\n2\nm\n. He also found the area of the lemniscate.\nFagnano made many other major contributions but his mathematical work was not without controversy. He was involved in priority disputes with\nNicolaus\n(\nI\n)\nBernoulli\nand, not surprisingly, the big dispute of the day which was between the supporters of\nNewton\nand those of\nLeibniz\n.\nBrook Taylor\nissued a challenge which\nBernoulli\nand Fagnano both answered; the background and details of this controversy are studied in\n[\n3\n]\n.\nFagnano received many honours. He had the title of count conferred on him by Louis XV in\n1721\n, was elected to the\nRoyal Society of London\nin\n1723\n, and was made a marquis of Sant' Onofrio in\n1745\n. In addition he was elected to the\nBerlin Academy of Sciences\nand was proposed for the Paris\nAcadémie des Sciences\nin\n1766\nbut died before he could be elected.",
