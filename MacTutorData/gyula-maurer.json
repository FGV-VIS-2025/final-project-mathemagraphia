  "summary": "Gyula Maurer was a Hungarian mathematician ( born in what is now Romania ) who worked in group theory.",
  "biografia": "Gyula Maurer\n's parents were József Maurer\n(1883\n-\n1955)\nand Lenke Demeter\n(1894\n-\n1980)\n. Gyula was born in Târnăveni, a town in Transylvania. The town had been Hungarian, with the name Dicsőszentmárton, until the end of World War I when, following the Treaty of Trianon, it had become part of Romania. The town is also sometimes known by its German name of Sankt Martin. Maurer's family were ethnic Hungarians and he grew up as a native Hungarian speaker. Maurer attended secondary school in Cluj\n(\nknown also by its German name, Klausenburg, and its Hungarian name Kolozsvár\n)\nand in Cristuru Secuiesc\n(\nHungarian name Székelykeresztúr\n)\nin eastern Transylvania. He then attended Bethlen College in Aiud\n(\nHungarian name Nagyenyed\n)\n, a town south of Cluj. Bethlen College had been a famous educational establishment since the\n17\nth\ncentury but the education there was much changed in character following the Treaty of Trianon. Maurer graduated from Bethlen College in\n1945\n.\nIn\n1946\nMaurer began his university studies at\nBolyai\nUniversity in Cluj. There is a quite complicated story of the Hungarian and Romanian universities in Cluj\n(\nand even the name of the city of Cluj, which was renamed Cluj-Napoca in the Ceausescu era\n)\nand we now give a short history of the\nBolyai\nUniversity that Maurer entered.  Cluj had, with the rest of Transylvania, been incorporated into Romania with the Treaty of Trianon in\n1919\n. The University in Cluj, which had been named the Franz Joseph University since\n1881\n, became a Romanian institution and was officially opened as such by King Ferdinand on\n1\nFebruary\n1920\n. The Hungarian university in Cluj moved first to Budapest, then to Szeged. The university in Cluj was, during these years between the two World Wars, named King Ferdinand I University. In\n1940\n, after the start of World War II, the Hungarian university was moved back from Szeged to Cluj, and the Romanian university in Cluj moved to Sibiu and Timișoara. In\n1945\n, following the end of World War II, the Romanian University returned to Cluj and was named Babeș University\n(\nafter the Romanian natural scientist Victor Babeș\n)\n. Parts of the Hungarian university in Cluj moved back to Szeged, while that part which remained in Cluj was named the\nBolyai\nUniversity\n(\nafter the mathematician\nJános Bolyai\n)\n. It was given the building that had belonged to Queen Mary Grammar School for girls. Maurer studied mathematics and physics at\nBolyai\nUniversity and his lecturers soon realised that their student was extremely talented. While still an undergraduate he began teaching. There were many changes at this time since Romania became a republic in\n1947\nand, in the following year, educational reforms impacted the University. Maurer graduated in\n1949\nand was appointed as a teaching assistant at\nBolyai\nUniversity.\nMaurer married Eva Nyilas; they had two children, Gyula\n(\nborn\n1951)\nand Adám József\n(\nborn\n1954)\n. He taught students in the mathematics and chemistry faculty. László Bitay writes in\n[\n1\n]\nthat the students:-\n... quickly took a liking to the young man who enthusiastically and competently taught subjects normally not the favorite of many students. In particular, he aroused the interest of the good students, treating them with great enthusiasm and devotion, without forgetting to help the weaker students.\nThe educational reforms continued to have a major impact on\nBolyai\nUniversity and several lecturers were removed in\n1952\n. At the same time some students were sent down and there was considerable tensions. Maurer taught algebra courses and in the academic year\n1954\n-\n55\nbe gave his course to students of the Hungarian\nBolyai\nUniversity and the students of the Romanian Babeș University. His lecture notes on Algebra were published in\n1957\n. Maurer had been employed as a teaching assistant at first but later he was promoted to assistant professor. He began publishing research articles in\n1955\nwith five papers appearing in that year, all written in Romanian. These are:\nRemark on multiplicative arithmetic functions\n;\nGroups of infinite permutations\n;\nContribution to the study of groups from their quasi-centre\n;\nOn the notion of power\n; and\nOn the normal series of the group of generalized infinite permutations\n. His papers on infinite permutation groups had introduced a topology on these groups and many of his papers over the next few years studied properties of topological groups and rings.\nHowever, in October\n1956\n, there was an uprising against the Soviet-friendly government of the People's Republic of Hungary. This Hungarian Revolution was started by students in Budapest and many students of\nBolyai\nUniversity in Cluj showed their support for it. After the Revolution was put down, there were serious repercussions at\nBolyai\nUniversity with some lecturers and students being put on trial and imprisoned. At this time Maurer lost his job at Bolyai University. In\n1959\nthe Babeș University and the\nBolyai\nUniversity in Cluj joined to became the Babeș-\nBolyai\nUniversity. Again this process was not achieved without opposition from some but after the new Babeș-Bolyai University was created, Maurer was appointed in\n1960\n. He had published some papers in German beginning in\n1958\n, as well as papers in Romanian. For example his German papers included:\nEine Topologisierung der Permutationsgruppen einer beliebigen unendlichen Menge\nⓉ\n(\nA topologisation of the permutation groups of any infinite set\n)\n(1958)\n;\n(\nwith Imre Virág\n)\nGewisse Untersuchungen über den Quotientenring eines kommutativen Ringes\nⓉ\n(\nStudies on the quotient ring of a commutative ring\n)\n(1960)\n;\nTopologische Untersuchung gewisser Substitutionsgruppen\nⓉ\n(\nTopological study of certain substitution groups\n)\n(1961)\n; and\nÜber im Endomorphismenringe einer abelschen Gruppe definierte unendliche Reihen und Produkte\nⓉ\n(\nAbout infinite series and products defined in the endomorphism rings of an Abelian group\n)\n(1962)\n.\nMaurer had been appointed to\nBolyai\nUniversity in\n1949\nwithout ever having obtained his doctorate but, after he was appointed to the new Babeș-\nBolyai\nUniversity, he worked towards that degree. His thesis advisor was\nGrigore C Moisil\n(1906\n-\n1973)\n, from the University of Bucharest, and, in\n1967\n, Maurer was awarded the degree for his thesis\nAlgebraische Strukturen, auf denen Topologien vermittels von Präordnungsrelationen eingeführt sind\nⓉ\n(\nAlgebraic structures on which topologies are introduced by means of preorder relations\n)\n. He continued teaching at Babeș-Bolyai University, publishing many fascinating articles on topological groups, universal algebras, topological universal algebras, fuzzy sets, fuzzy groups, and rings satisfying polynomial identities. Remarkably, he wrote papers in Hungarian, Romanian, German, French, English, Italian and Russian. We should mention that he wrote several important books in Hungarian, in particular two with Imre Virág,\nThe elements of the theory of relations\n(1972)\nand\nIntroduction to the Theory of Structures\n(1976)\n. He also wrote single-authored books such as\nContinued fractions and decimals\n(1981)\n.\nIn\n1984\nhis sons Gyula Maurer and Adám József Maurer moved from Romania to Hungary. When Maurer retired in the following year from his position at Babeș-Bolyai University in Cluj-Napoca he followed his sons to Hungary and took up a position at the University of Miskolc\n(\nUniversity of Heavy Industry in Miskolc\n)\n, where he was appointed full professor and director of the Institute of Mathematics. He now wanted to start up a Hungarian mathematics magazine which would be open to all areas of mathematics and to all countries. At this time, however, the countries of Central Europe were in the unfortunate position of being separated by the Iron Curtain from the countries of the West. Undeterred by the political problems, Maurer pressed ahead with his idea, supported by Hans Sachs from the University of Mining and Metallurgy of Leoben in Austria. The events of\n1989\n, when normal relations were re-established between the countries of Europe, made their project considerably easier. In\n1990\n, supported by the Technical University of Miskolc and the University of Leoben, they founded a new journal which they named Mathematica Pannonia. Maurer and Sachs became the first editors of the journal which has produced two issues per years since it was founded. The Journal is described on its website as follows:-\nMathematica Pannonica is a peer-reviewed mathematical journal devoted to the publication of high quality research papers on pure and applied mathematics. The journal was started in\n1990\n, and brings out two issues per annum. The idea of launching a high level international mathematical journal in Austrian-Hungarian cooperation stems from professors I Gy Maurer\n(\nHungary\n)\nand H Sachs\n(\nAustria\n)\n. As a result of their initiative the first volume of 'Mathematica Pannonica' was published in\n1990\n. One year later, in\n1991\n, professor G Tironi\n(\nItaly\n)\njoined  the \"Founding Fathers\" and the journal has became a truly \"Pannon\" scientific journal\n(\ncomprising the historical regions of the ancient 'Pannonia Inferior and Pannonia Superior'\n)\n. The aim of launching this journal was emphasized in the Editorial Preface of the first issue and reads: \"Our primary aim is to serve the mathematical community. At the same time it is not a secret that by organizing this journal we wish to contribute to the upgrading of the once flourishing network of cultural ties in the Central European Region.\" This specific aim has unquestionably been reflected in the composition of the Editorial Board of the journal in the past two decades.\nThe first paper in the first part of the first volume is by\nPaul Erdős\n. Also in this first part are papers by\nPaul Cohn\nand, if I may add a personal note, by my\n[\nEFR\n]\nSt Andrews colleague and co-author\nTom Blyth\n.\nMaurer died in Maglód, near Budapest, and after being cremated, on\n28\nJanuary\n2012\nthe urn containing his ashes was buried in the family grave at the Central Házsongárdi Cemetery in Cluj-Napoca.",
