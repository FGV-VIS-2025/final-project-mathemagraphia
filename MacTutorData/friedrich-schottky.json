  "biografia": "Friedrich Schottky\n's father, Hermann Schottky\n(1816\n-\n1863)\n, had been awarded a doctorate and was a lecturer in English at Breslau when Friedrich was born. Friedrich's mother was Louise Winkler\n(1818\n-\n1908)\nwho was a flower-maker from Breslau. Friedrich attended the Humanistisches\nGymnasium\nSt Magdalenen in Breslau beginning his studies there in\n1860\n. While there he, together with a number of other pupils\n(\nincluding Max Grube, Heinrich Rosin and Eberhard Gothein\n)\n, was a founding member of the student literary organization \"Concordia\". These students cooperated in producing a school magazine entitled\nBildung der Jugend durch sich selbst\nⓉ\n(\nEducation of youth by themselves\n)\n. After graduating from the Gymnasium, Schottky entered the University of Breslau in\n1870\n, graduating in\n1874\n. After leaving Breslau he studied at the University of Berlin, taught by\nKarl Weierstrass\n,\nEduard Kummer\nand\nHermann von Helmholtz\n, obtaining his doctorate in\n1875\nfor his thesis\nÜber die conforme Abbildung mehrfach zusammenhängender ebener Flächen\nⓉ\n(\nOn the conformal representation of multiply connected planar surfaces\n)\n. The thesis was examined by\nWeierstrass\nand\nKummer\nand, after the examination,\nWeierstrass\nwrote to\nSofia Kovalevskaya\non\n7\nMay\n1875\nsaying\n[\n3\n]\n:-\n... that this work\n(\non\nconformal mappings\nof multiply connected domains\n)\nis one of the best he ever examined ...\nHowever, in his letter to\nKovalevskaya\n,\nWeierstrass\ngoes on to make a number of interesting comments about Schottky's personality and about his time as a research student in Berlin\n(\nsee\n[\n3\n]\n)\n:-\nThe author is of a clumsy appearance, unprepossessing, a dreamer, but, if I'm not completely wrong, he possesses an important mathematical talent. On Christmas Eve he was suddenly arrested and led away to the barracks to serve a\n3\n-year term as a common soldier, for 'he had forgotten' to register in time for a\n1\n-year term as a volunteer\n(\nas every student does\n)\n. Fortunately, he proved to be so useless as a soldier that he was discharged as unsuitable after\n6\nweeks. Thus, he could return to his dissertation. He then signed up for the examination without presenting the requisite certificates and without knowing anything about the necessary formalities. As rector I had to cancel his name from the register because neither had he attended lectures nor were his whereabouts in Berlin known.\nCertainly the quality of Schottky's thesis was outstanding. Reinhard Bölling writes\n[\n3\n]\n:-\nIn\n1875\n, Schottky discovered a type of function which was later intensively studied, in full generality, by\nPoincaré\nand\nKlein\n(\nautomorphic functions\n)\n. He was the first to study systematically conformal mappings of multiply connected domains. In the case of a domain bounded by p closed curves\n(\np ≥\n2)\n, Schottky discovered that there exist\n3\np -\n3\nreal constants that characterize the conformal class to which this region belongs. These are now called the moduli of the class.\nAfter obtaining his doctorate, Schottky remained at the University of Berlin for a while but submitted his\nhabilitation\nthesis to the University of Breslau in\n1878\n. His school friend Eberhard Gothein also habilitated at the University of Breslau in the same year having undertaken research in the history of economics. Schottky taught as a\ndocent\nat Breslau until\n1882\nwhen he was appointed professor of mathematics in the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule Zürich. During his four years lecturing at Breslau, Schottky published two papers:\nAbriss einer Theorie der Abel'schen Functionen von drei Variabeln\nⓉ\n(\nOutline of the theory of Abelian functions of three variables\n)\n(1880)\nand\nÜber eindeutige Functionen mit linearen Transformationen in sich\nⓉ\n(\nOn uniform functions with linear transformations into themselves\n)\n(1882)\n. He held the chair in Zürich for ten years before moving to another chair at the University of Marburg in\n1892\n. Keeping up his move every ten years he went to a chair at the University of Berlin in\n1902\nbut remained there for twenty years until he retired in\n1922\n. It was\nLazarus Fuchs\n's chair at Berlin to which Schottky was appointed and many felt that his personal friendship with\nFrobenius\nwas a factor in his appointment. Certainly Schottky had made highly significant mathematical contributions\n(\nwhich we will comment on below\n)\nbut it was clear to most people that his best years as a mathematician were behind him by\n1902\n. However, he still produced significant results although his teaching was considered to be below par\n[\n3\n]\n:-\nSchottky's teaching qualities were not impressive\n(\n\"As a teacher he is unsuitable\",\nKummer\nonce said\n)\n. Perhaps, for this reason, he almost never taught beginners' classes in Berlin.\nWhen Schottky retired from his Berlin chair it allowed\nIssai Schur\n, who had been an extraordinary professor since\n1916\n, to become a full professor.\nMost of Schottky's work concerns elliptic,\nabelian\nand theta functions. We have already mentioned above his doctoral thesis which made an important contribution to conformal mappings of multiply connected plane domains. This was the origin of the mapping of a domain bounded by three disjoint circles which provides an example of an automorphic function with a\nCantor\nset boundary. Schottky's thesis also discusses conformal mappings of domains bounded by circular and\nconic\narcs. This thesis was published in\n1877\nas a fifty-page paper. Schottky's paper\nÜber eine specielle Function, welche bei einer bestimmten linearen Transformation ihres Arguments unverändert bleibt\nⓉ\n(\nOn a special function which remains unchanged at a given linear transformation of its argument\n)\n(1887)\n, advanced the theory of\nPoincaré\nseries considerably. The Schottky problem is the problem of finding characterizations of Jacobians among all principally polarized abelian varieties. He studied this problem, already posed by\nBernhard Riemann\n, in his\n1888\npaper\nZur Theorie der Abelschen Funktionen von vier Variabeln\nⓉ\n(\nOn the theory of Abelian functions of four variables\n)\n, showing that principally-polarized Abelian varieties\n(\nof dimension\ng\ng\ng\n)\ndo not coincide with the Jacobian varieties\n(\nof an algebraic curve of genus\ng\ng\ng\n)\nfor\ng\n=\n4\ng = 4\ng\n=\n4\n. The varieties do coincide for\ng\n≤\n3\ng ≤ 3\ng\n≤\n3\n. Schottky's Theorem\n(1904)\nis related to\nPicard\n's Theorem and has become a classical result in the theory of functions of a complex variable.\nSchottky published\n55\npapers and, in\n1880\n, a book\nAbriss einer Theorie der Abel'schen Functionen von drei Variablen\nⓉ\n(\nOutline of the theory of Abelian functions of three variables\n)\n. In\n[\n1\n]\nHans Freudenthal\nwrites:-\nHis work is difficult to read. Although he was a student of\nWeierstrass\n, his approach to function theory was Riemannian in spirit, combined with Weierstrassian rigour.\nAmong Schottky's doctoral students we should mention\nHeinrich Jung\nwho was his student at Marburg. Schottky and\nJung\njointly authored the important\n1909\npaper\nNeue Sätze über Symmetralfunktionen und die Abel'schen Funktionen der Riemann'schen Theorie\nwhich made a significant contribution to the Schottky problem. They also co-authored\nNeue Sätze über Symmetralfunktionen und die Abelschen Funktionen der Riemannschen Theorie\n(1912)\n. Perhaps it is worth noting that these two papers with\nJung\nwere the only two joint papers which Schottky published. He was an examiner of\nPaul Koebe\n's doctoral thesis at Berlin in\n1905\n, was an advisor for\nKonrad Knopp\n's\n1907\nBerlin thesis and supervised the doctoral work of several other students at Berlin.\nFinally we should mention Schottky's family. He married Henriette Hammer\n(1858\n-\n1947)\nwho was the daughter of Heinrich Hammer\n(1823\n-\n1860)\nfrom Waldenburg\n(\nnow Walbrzych\n)\nin Silesia, a District Judge from Breslau, and Eveline von Meichsner\n(1828\n-\n1907)\nfrom Jauer\n(\nnow Jawor\n)\nin Silesia. Henriette and Friedrich Schottky had one daughter and four sons, including the physicist Walter Schottky who was born on\n23\nJuly\n1886\nin Zürich, Switzerland. Walter Schottky was a doctoral student of\nMax Planck\nin Berlin in\n1912\nat the time when his father was professor there. He made important contributions to the theory of the electron as well as inventing the screen-grid vacuum tube and the pentode. Walter Schottky died on\n4\nMarch\n1976\n. Another of Schottky's sons, Hermann Schottky\n(1885\n-\n1974)\nwas a metallurgist, and Ernst Schottky\n(1888\n-\n1915)\nwas a botanist who died in World War I.\nSchottky was elected a corresponding member of the\nBerlin Academy of Sciences\nin\n1900\nand was made a full member two years later. He died and was buried in the Steglitz area of Berlin after a funeral attended only by close family members.",
